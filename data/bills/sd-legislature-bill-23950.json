The secretary of corrections may enter into agreements with other agencies of the state and the political subdivisions for the confinement and the providing of other services for those inmates whose employment or vocational training or other educational programs so require, and such agencies of the state and the political subdivisions may enter into such agreements. Section 80. That \u00a7 24-15-1 be AMENDED: 24-15-1. If a defendant is sentenced to a state correctional facility, the Department of Corrections shall develop a file which shall contain a complete history of that person. The executive director of the Board of Pardons and Paroles shall generate an adequate case history of each inmate of a state correctional facility to enable the executive director to make recommendations to the Board of Pardons and Paroles. The case history shall include results of risk and needs assessments of the inmate conducted by the department and other agencies as available and copies of documents relevant to supervision, treatment, and violation decisions in the inmate's prior prison, probation and parole custodies. The case history shall be transferred and kept as a permanent record of the Department of Corrections, solely for the proper supervision of the inmate by the Department of Corrections and as a guide to the inmate's needs. Except for the information authorized for release pursuant to \u00a7 24-2-20, no person other than members of the Board of Pardons and Paroles, its executive director, the secretary of corrections, or any person specifically delegated for such access by the secretary of corrections, may inspect such file unless otherwise ordered by a circuit court or subpoena after notice to the secretary of corrections and an opportunity for a hearing on any objections to inspection. The secretary shall have ten days after receipt of the notice to inform the court if the secretary requests a hearing. Section 81. That \u00a7 24-15-1.1 be AMENDED: 24-15-1.1. Parole is the discretionary conditional release of an inmate from actual state correctional facility custody before the expiration of the inmate's term of imprisonment. The prisoner remains an inmate under the legal custody of the Department of Corrections until the expiration of the inmate's term of imprisonment. A prisoner is not required to accept a conditional parole. A prisoner is never entitled to parole. However, parole may be granted if in the judgment of the Board of Pardons and Paroles granting a parole would be in the best interests of society and the prisoner. Neither this section or its application may be the basis for establishing a constitutionally protected liberty, property, or due process interest in any prisoner. Section 82. That \u00a7 24-15-3 be AMENDED: 24-15-3. Whenever any person becomes an inmate of a state correctional facility, the Department of Corrections must immediately establish in the record the date when the inmate will be eligible for consideration for parole. Such consideration for a parole eligibility date is subject to change upon receipt of information regarding a change in the number of prior felony convictions or any subsequent felony convictions. Any inmate who is aggrieved by the established parole consideration eligibility date may apply for a hearing before the Board of Pardons and Paroles for a final determination of the true and correct parole consideration eligibility date. Between the date a person becomes an inmate of the state correctional facility and the date on which the person becomes eligible for consideration for parole, the department must complete the history of the inmate and must study the life, habits, previous environment, and nature of the inmate to determine the advisability of recommending the inmate for parole when the inmate becomes eligible to be considered. At least ten days before the date of eligibility the department must submit to the board the findings regarding the inmate. Section 83. That \u00a7 24-15-7.1 be AMENDED: 24-15-7.1. Any person convicted of a felony while an inmate under the custody of the Department of Corrections and for which the sentence is made to run consecutively is not eligible for consideration for parole until serving the last of all such consecutive sentences. In such cases the parole consideration eligibility date shall be established subject to the provisions of subdivisions 24\u201115\u20115(2) and (3). Section 84. That \u00a7 24-15-8 be AMENDED: 24-15-8. When an inmate becomes eligible for consideration for parole, the inmate is entitled to a hearing with the Board of Pardons and Paroles to present the inmate's application for parole. An inmate may decline parole consideration and waive the right to a hearing. The board may issue an order to the Department of Corrections that the inmate shall be paroled if it is satisfied that: (1) The inmate has been confined in a state correctional facility for a sufficient length of time to accomplish the inmate's rehabilitation; (2) The inmate will be paroled under the supervision and restrictions provided by law for parolees, without danger to society; and (3) The inmate has secured suitable employment or beneficial occupation of the inmate's time likely to continue until the end of the period of the inmate's parole in some suitable place within or without the state where the inmate will be free from criminal influences. Neither this section nor its application may be the basis for establishing a constitutionally protected liberty, property, or due process interest in any prisoner. Section 85. That \u00a7 24-15-9 be AMENDED: 24-15-9. The Board of Pardons and Paroles may order the Department of Corrections to transfer any inmate to the Human Services Center. The director of the human services center shall notify the Department of Corrections when the inmate is ready to be transferred back to the state correctional facility. Upon receipt of the notice, the Department of Corrections shall within five days bring the inmate back to the state correctional facility. Section 86. That \u00a7 24-15-21 be AMENDED: 24-15-21. If the chair of the Board of Pardons and Parole is satisfied that any provision of \u00a7 24-15-20 or 24-15A-27 has been violated or an inmate under parole supervision in the community has escaped, the executive director of the Board of Pardons and Parole may issue a warrant approved by the chair or a designee of the Board of Pardons and Parole to the Department of Corrections, a law enforcement officer, or parole agent directing that the parolee or inmate named be arrested. Pursuant to the provisions of \u00a7 24-15-23, the parolee may be returned to the state correctional facility. Upon the issuance of the warrant, the running of the parole supervision time shall be suspended until the board has entered a final order on the revocation. The board shall credit the inmate with time spent in custody as a direct result of the parole violation. Section 87. That \u00a7 24-15-22 be AMENDED: 24-15-22. Immediately upon the return of a parolee to the state correctional facility, the supervising agent shall immediately furnish to the Board of Pardons and Paroles the permanent records and a report containing all the facts connected with the return of the parolee. Section 88. That \u00a7 24-15-23 be AMENDED: 24-15-23. Subject to the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 24-15-23.1 and 24-15-23.2, within ten working days of the arrest of the parolee, a preliminary hearing must be held. The preliminary hearing must be held before an independent hearing officer to determine if there is probable cause to believe that the parolee has violated the terms and conditions of the parolee's parole status. The parolee has the right to waive this preliminary hearing at any time after the order for arrest has been issued by the executive director of the Board of Pardons and Paroles. If probable cause is found to exist, the parolee is to be returned to the state correctional facility, there to be held, for a hearing to be held before the Board of Pardons and Paroles to determine whether the parole should be revoked. If the parolee wishes to admit to an alleged violation of conditions of parole, the parolee may waive an appearance at the revocation hearing with the board. Section 89. That \u00a7 24-15A-4 be REPEALED. Section 90. That \u00a7 24-15A-6 be AMENDED: 24-15A-6. The department must establish the sentence discharge date for each inmate based on the total sentence length, minus court ordered jail time credit. The total sentence length is the sum of imprisonment time and any suspended time. In the case of an entirely suspended state incarceration sentence under the supervision of the Department of Corrections and the Board of Pardons and Paroles pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 22-6-11, 23A-27-18.4, and 23A-27-19, the total sentence length is the term of imprisonment that has been suspended. Each inmate is under the jurisdiction of the department, either incarcerated or under parole release or a combination, for the entire term of the inmate's total sentence length unless the board grants an early final discharge pursuant to \u00a7 24-15A-8, a partial early final discharge pursuant to \u00a7 24-15A-8.1, the court modifies the sentence, the inmate receives earned discharge credits pursuant to \u00a7 24-15A-50 or 24-15A-50.1, the inmate receives a compliant discharge pursuant to \u00a7 16-22-29, or the sentence is commuted. Section 91. That \u00a7 24-15A-15 be AMENDED: 24-15A-15. Parole is the conditional release of an inmate from actual state correctional facility custody before the expiration of the inmate's term of imprisonment. The prisoner remains an inmate under the legal custody of the department until the expiration of the inmate's term of imprisonment. A prisoner is not required to accept parole. Section 92. That \u00a7 24-15A-20 be AMENDED: 24-15A-20. If a person is convicted of a felony while an inmate under the custody of the warden of the Department of Corrections, the sentence shall run consecutively and the person is not eligible for consideration for parole until serving the last of all such consecutive sentences, unless the sentencing court specifically orders otherwise. The parole date shall be established subject to the provisions of \u00a7 24-15A-32. This section does not apply to a person who commits a felony while on parole as defined in \u00a7 24-15A-15. Section 93. That \u00a7 24-15A-32 be AMENDED: 24-15A-32. Each inmate sentenced to a state incarceration term, except those under a sentence of life or death, or determined to be ineligible for parole as authorized in \u00a7 24-15A-32.1, must have an initial parole date set by the department. This date must be calculated by applying the percentage indicated in the following grid to the full term, minus any suspended time of the inmate's sentence pursuant to \u00a7 22-6-1. The following crimes or an attempt to commit, a conspiracy to commit, or a solicitation to commit any of the following crimes shall be considered a violent crime for purposes of setting an initial parole date: murder, manslaughter, rape, aggravated assault, riot, robbery, burglary in the first degree, burglary in the second degree if committed before July 1, 2006, arson, kidnapping, felony sexual contact as defined in \u00a7 22-22-7, child abuse, felony sexual contact as defined in \u00a7 22-22-7.2, felony stalking as defined in \u00a7\u00a7 22-19A-2 and 22-19A-3, photographing a child in an obscene act, felony assault as defined in \u00a7\u00a7 22-18-26 and 22-18-29, felony simple assault as defined in \u00a7 22-18-1, aggravated criminal battery of an unborn child as defined in \u00a7 22-18-1.3, aggravated battery of an infant as defined in \u00a7 22-18-1.4, assault with intent to cause serious permanent disfigurement as defined in \u00a7 22-18-1.5, commission of a felony while armed as defined in \u00a7 22-14-12, discharging a firearm at an occupied structure or motor vehicle as defined in \u00a7 22-14-20, discharging a firearm from a moving vehicle as defined in \u00a7 22-14-21, criminal pedophilia, threatening to commit a sexual offense as defined in \u00a7 22-22-45, abuse or neglect of a disabled adult as defined in \u00a7 22-46-2, and aggravated incest as defined in \u00a7\u00a7 22-22A-3 and 22-22A-3.1: Felony Convictions Felony Class First Second Third Nonviolent Class 6 .25 .30 .40 Class 5 .25 .35 .40 Class 4 .25 .35 .40 Class 3 .30 .40 .50 Class 2 .30 .40 .50 Class 1 .35 .40 .50 Class C .35 .40 .50 Violent Class 6 .35 .45 .55 Class 5 .40 .50 .60 Class 4 .40 .50 .65 Class 3 .50 .60 .70 Class 2 .50 .65 .75 Class 1 .50 .65 .75 Class C .50 .65 .75 Class B 1.0 1.0 1.0 Class A 1.0 1.0 1.0 The application of the violent or nonviolent column of the grid is based on whether the inmate's current sentence is for a violent or nonviolent crime. The department shall consider any prior felony regardless of whether the crime is violent or nonviolent when determining which percentage to apply to the inmate's parole date calculation. Each inmate shall serve at least sixty days prior to parole release. An inmate with a life sentence is not eligible for parole except as provided in \u00a7\u00a7 24-15A-55 to 24-15A-68, inclusive. An initial parole date through the application of this grid may be applied to a life sentence only after the sentence is commuted to a term of years. A Class A or B felony commuted to a number of years shall be applied to the Class C violent column of the grid. An inmate convicted of a Class A or B felony who was a juvenile at the time of the offense and receives a sentence of less than life shall be applied to the Class C violent column of the grid. Section 94. That \u00a7 25-6-4 be AMENDED: 25-6-4. No child may be adopted without the consent of the child's parents. However, if it is in the best interest of the child, the court may waive consent from a parent or putative father who: (1) Has been convicted of any crime punishable by imprisonment in a state correctional facility for a period that, in the opinion of the court, will deprive the child of the parent's companionship for a critical period of time; (2) Has, by clear and convincing evidence, abandoned the child for six months or more immediately prior to the filing of the petition; (3) Has substantially and continuously or repeatedly neglected the child and refused to give the child necessary parental care and protection; (4) Being financially able, has willfully neglected to provide the child with the necessary subsistence, education, or other care necessary for the child's health, morals, or welfare or has neglected to pay for such subsistence, education, or other care if legal custody of the child is lodged with others and such payment ordered by the court; (5) Is unfit by reason of habitual abuse of intoxicating liquor or narcotic drugs; (6) Has been judicially deprived of the custody of the child, if the adjudication is final on appeal to the court of last resort or the time for an appeal has expired; (6A) Has caused the child to be conceived as a result of rape or incest; or (7) Does not appear personally or by counsel at the hearing to terminate parental rights after notice pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 25-5A-11 and 25-5A-12 which was received at least fifteen days prior to the hearing.

A child under the age of eighteen years who has been sentenced as an adult felon to a term of imprisonment in a state correctional facility may be placed in a Department of Corrections juvenile facility by the secretary of corrections. This section does not affect the child's status as an adult offender and inmate of the state correctional facility. Section 96. That \u00a7 26-11A-20 be AMENDED: 26-11A-20. The secretary of corrections may discharge a juvenile from the Department of Corrections upon the following: (1) As a reward for good conduct and upon satisfactory evidence of reformation; (2) As a result of a conviction for a new crime as an adult, if the juvenile is placed on adult probation or sentenced to the county jail or a state correctional facility; (3) If the juvenile, upon reaching the age of majority, lives outside the jurisdiction of the State of South Dakota and the interstate compact on juveniles is not available due to the juvenile's age or circumstances; or (4) If the juvenile is on aftercare and has a suitable placement, and a discharge is determined to be in the best interests of the juvenile.

The court, in pronouncing sentencing, shall revoke the person's driver license for a period of not less than three years from the date the sentence is imposed or three years from the date of initial release from imprisonment, whichever is later. If the person is returned to imprisonment prior to the completion of the period of driver license revocation, time spent imprisoned does not count toward fulfilling the period of revocation. If the person is convicted of driving without a license during that period, the court shall sentence the person to the county jail for not less than twenty days, which sentence may not be suspended. Notwithstanding \u00a7 23A-27-19, the court retains jurisdiction to modify the conditions of the license revocation for the term of such revocation. Upon the person's successful completion of a court-approved chemical dependency counseling program and proof of financial responsibility pursuant to \u00a7 32-35-113, the court may permit the person to operate a vehicle for the purposes of employment, 24/7 sobriety testing, attendance at school, child care delivery or pickup, or attendance at counseling programs.
