BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That chapter 10-6 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Notwithstanding the provisions of \u00a7 10-6-33, agricultural land shall be assessed based on its agricultural income value. The agricultural income value of agricultural land shall be determined on the basis of productivity and the annual earnings capacity of the agricultural land, if the land is used for agricultural purposes. The productivity of land and its annual earning capacity shall be based on data collected and analyzed pursuant to sections 2 to 5, inclusive, of this Act. Section 2. That chapter 10-6 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Agricultural income value is defined as the capitalized average annual earning capacity. The capacity of the cropland to produce agricultural products shall be based on average yields for crops or plants under natural conditions. The capacity of noncropland to produce agricultural products shall be based on average acres per animal unit under natural conditions. For the purpose of this section, annual earning capacity for: (1) Cropland is twenty-five percent of the annual gross income produced; and (2) Noncropland is twenty-five percent of the annual gross income capacity of the land based upon the animal-carrying capacity of the land. The economics department of South Dakota State University shall annually compute the average annual earning capacity of cropland and noncropland for each county using the database defined in section 4 of this Act. Any agricultural land receiving income from the conservation reserve program or other government program that makes annual payments shall be treated as cropland income unless it is clearly identified as a noncropland payment. The average annual earning capacity shall be capitalized at a rate of eight and one-half percent to determine the capitalized average annual earning capacity. The economics department shall annually provide the secretary of revenue an agricultural income value for cropland, noncropland, and a composite agricultural income value for each county by June first. Section 3. That chapter 10-6 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Before July first, the secretary of revenue shall annually provide each director of equalization the agricultural income value for each county as computed pursuant to section 2 of this Act. The director of equalization shall annually determine the assessed value of agricultural land. Agricultural land shall be assessed based on its agricultural income value and adjusted by the following factors: (1) The capacity of the land to produce agricultural products as specified in section 2 of this Act; and (2) The location, size, soil survey statistics, terrain, and topographical condition of the land including the climate, accessibility, and surface obstructions which can be documented. Section 4. That chapter 10-6 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: The secretary of revenue shall enter into contracts with South Dakota State University and, if necessary, the South Dakota Agricultural Statistics Service for the purpose of creating a database to determine the agricultural income value of agricultural land by county. A database for an identifiable region within a county may be created if the director of equalization shows a need for establishing identifiable regions within a county. The secretary shall collect such data for 1995, which will serve as the first year of the database, and each year thereafter. The database shall consist of the most recent eight years of data that have been collected and the years representing the highest and lowest agricultural income value shall be discarded from the database. The database for the 2004 assessment shall consist of data from 1995 to 2002, inclusive, and the database for each assessment year thereafter shall be adjusted accordingly. Section 5. That chapter 10-6 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Agricultural land shall be divided by the director of equalization into categories, including cropland and noncropland, so that the categories reflect actual use of the agricultural land. Each category shall be divided into classes based on soil classification standards developed by the United States Department of Agriculture Natural Resources Conservation Service. Section 6. That chapter 10-6 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Buildings and structures, other than normally occupied dwellings on agricultural land and automobile garages or portions of buildings used for that purpose, which are used exclusively for agricultural purposes and situated on agricultural land, are hereby specifically classified for tax purposes as agricultural property and shall be assessed by using the cost approach less depreciation as prescribed by the Department of Revenue. Section 7. That chapter 10-6 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: The secretary of revenue may promulgate rules pursuant to chapter 1-26 to provide for: (1) Criteria for determining the cost approach and depreciation procedure for agricultural buildings and structures; (2) Criteria for determining the assessed value of dwellings on agricultural land and automobile garages or portions of buildings used for that purpose; (3) Application of cropland and noncropland income values; and (4) Soil classification standards. Section 8. That chapter 10-6 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: The agricultural income value for agricultural land as determined pursuant to section 1 of this Act represents eighty-five percent of the fair market value. Section 9. That \u00a7 10-6-1 be amended to read as follows: 10-6-1. Terms used in this chapter mean: (1) \"Credit,\" every claim and demand for money or other valuable thing and every annuity or sum of money receivable at stated periods, due or to become due, and all claims and demands secured by deeds or mortgages due or to become due, except for contracts for deed and mortgages, in which case the term means only the payment received each year under the contract or mortgage; (2) \"District,\" township, municipality , or ward, as the case may be; (3) \"Full agricultural land value,\" the value of agricultural land as determined by the application of this chapter; (4) \"Money,\" gold and silver coin, treasury notes, bank notes, and every deposit which any person owning the same or holding in trust and residing in this state is entitled to withdraw in money on demand; (5) \"Tract,\" \"lot,\" \"piece,\" or \"parcel\" of real property, or \"piece or parcel of land,\" any contiguous quantity of land in the possession of, owned by, or recorded as, the property of the same claimant, person, or company; (6) \"True and full value,\" for all real property, except agricultural land, the usual cash selling price at the place where the property to which the term is applied shall be at the time of the assessment.

The true and full value in money of agricultural land, as defined by \u00a7 10-6-31, which has been in primarily agricultural use for at least five successive years immediately preceding the tax year for which assessment is to be made shall be the market value as determined for each county through the use of all comparable sales of agricultural land based on consideration of the following factors: (1) The capacity of the land to produce agricultural products as defined in \u00a7 10-6-33.2; and (2) The soil, terrain, and topographical condition of the property including but not limited to capability, the land's use, climate, accessibility, and surface obstructions which can be documented through an analysis of land selling prices. The comparable sales that are used shall be evidenced by an instrument recorded with the register of deeds of the county in which the land is located, if the date of such instrument and the recording date is not more than two years prior to the assessment year. Section 11. That \u00a7 10-6-33.2 be repealed. 10-6-33.2. Capacity of land in agricultural use to produce agricultural products shall be based on average yields under natural conditions, in the case of land producing crops or plants, and on the average \"acres per animal unit,\" in the case of grazing land; said average shall affect each operating unit and shall be based on the ten-year period immediately preceding the tax year in issue. In determining such capacity to produce, the county director of equalization and/or the county board of equalization must take into consideration yields, and/or carrying capacity, as determined by the soil conservation service, the agricultural stabilization and conservation service, the extension service, federal land bank, and private lending agencies dealing with land production capacities.

Section 15. That \u00a7 10-6-33.6 be repealed. 10-6-33.6. If the median market value per acre in an identifiable region within a county deviates by more than ten percent from the county median market value per acre, the county director of equalization may establish a separate market value per acre for the land defined by the director of equalization within that identifiable region. Section 16. That \u00a7 10-6-33.7 be repealed. 10-6-33.7. Agricultural land in each county shall be divided into the eight classes defined by the United States Department of Agriculture's soil conservation service as published in its soil survey for each county.
