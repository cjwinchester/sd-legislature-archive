BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That chapter 11-9 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: A tax increment is that amount obtained by multiplying the total general property taxes levied by the governing body approving the creation of the tax incremental district on all taxable property within a tax incremental district in any year by a fraction having a numerator equal to that year's assessed value of all taxable property in the district minus the tax incremental base and a denominator equal to that year's assessed value of all taxable property in the district. In any year, a tax increment is positive if the tax incremental base is less than the aggregate assessed value of taxable property. It is negative if the base exceeds such value. Section 2. That chapter 11-9 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: With respect to the municipality having the power to levy taxes on property located within a tax incremental district, the calculation of the assessed valuation of taxable property in a tax incremental district, for purposes of computing the dollar and cents rate of the municipality, may not exceed the tax incremental base of the district until the district is terminated. The dollar and cents rate of the municipality so determined, however, shall be assessed and extended against all taxable property in the tax incremental district at its current assessed valuation. However, no change in South Dakota law affecting taxation of property may result in a lesser rate for the tax incremental base until the district is terminated pursuant to this chapter. Section 3. That chapter 11-9 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: After all project costs and all tax incremental bonds and notes of the tax incremental district have been paid or provided for subject to any agreement with bondholders, if any moneys remain in the fund, the moneys shall be paid to the general fund of the municipality. Section 4. The provisions of \u00a7 \u00a7 11-9-26, 11-9-27, and 11-9-45 apply to any tax incremental district created before July 1, 2004. The provisions of sections 1 to 3, inclusive, of this Act apply only to any tax incremental district created after June 30, 2004."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 18448, "action_date": "2004-01-13T12:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 99180, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/99180.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 17, "committee_id_action": 831, "committee_id_assigned": 827, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 18448, "action_date": "2004-01-20T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 99351, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/99351.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 827, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 18448, "action_date": "2004-01-20T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 99351, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/99351.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to 36th legislative day", "journal_page": 111, "committee_id_action": 827, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 57230, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [3057, 3073, 3088, 3100, 3110, 3127, 3140, 3143, 3147, 3148], "Nay": [3078, 3085, 3102, 3142], "Excused": [3095]}}, {"bill_id": 18448, "action_date": "2004-01-20T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 99351, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/99351.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to 36th legislative day", "journal_page": 111, "committee_id_action": 827, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 57230, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [3057, 3073, 3088, 3100, 3110, 3127, 3140, 3143, 3147, 3148], "Nay": [3078, 3085, 3102, 3142], "Excused": [3095]}}]}
