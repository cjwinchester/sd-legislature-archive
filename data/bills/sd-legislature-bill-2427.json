Section 30. If conducting utilization review or making a benefit determination for emergency services, a health carrier that provides benefits for services in an emergency department of a hospital shall comply with the provisions of sections 30 to 38, inclusive, of this Act.

If the emergency services are provided out-of-network, without imposing any administrative requirement or limitation on coverage that is more restrictive than the requirements or limitations that apply to emergency services received from network providers.

Section 35. If a heath benefit plan has more than one negotiated amount for in-network providers for a particular emergency service, the amount in subdivision (1) of section 33 of this Act is the median of these negotiated amounts. Section 36. Any cost-sharing requirement other than a copayment or coinsurance requirement, such as a deductible or out-of-pocket maximum, may be imposed with respect to emergency services provided out-of-network if the cost-sharing requirement generally applies to out-of-network benefits. A deductible may be imposed with respect to out-of-network emergency services only as part of a deductible that generally applies to out-of-network benefits. If an out-of-pocket maximum generally applies to out-of-network benefits, that out-of-network maximum applies to out-of-network emergency services. Section 37.

If a health carrier fails to strictly adhere to the requirements of sections 52 to 57, inclusive, and sections 65 to 73, inclusive, of this Act, with respect to making utilization review and benefit determinations of a benefit request or claim, the covered person shall be deemed to have exhausted the provisions of sections 22 to 74, inclusive, of this Act, and may take action regardless of whether the health carrier asserts that the carrier substantially complied with the requirements of sections 52 to 57, inclusive, and sections 65 to 73, inclusive, of this Act, as applicable, or that any error it committed was de minimus. Any covered person may file a request for external review in accordance with rules promulgated by the director.

A health carrier shall maintain written procedures pursuant to sections 28 to 74, inclusive, of this Act, for making standard utilization review and benefit determinations on requests submitted to the health carrier by covered persons or their authorized representatives for benefits and for notifying covered persons and their authorized representatives of its determinations with respect to these requests within the specified time frames required under sections 28 to 74, inclusive, of this Act. If a period of time is extended as permitted by sections 28 to 74, inclusive, of this Act, due to a claimant's failure to submit information necessary to decide a prospective, retrospective, or disability claim, the period for making the benefit determination shall be tolled from the date on which the notification of the extension is sent to the claimant until the date on which the claimant responds to the request for additional information. Section 53.

Notwithstanding section 32 of this Act, a covered person may be required to pay, in addition to the in-network cost-sharing, the excess of the amount the out-of-network provider charges over the amount the health carrier is required to pay pursuant to this section. A health carrier complies with the requirements of this section if it provides payment of emergency services provided by an out-of-network provider in an amount not less than the greatest of the following: (1) The amount negotiated with in-network providers for emergency services, excluding any in-network copayment or coinsurance imposed with respect to the covered person; (2) The amount of the emergency service calculated using the same method the plan uses to determine payments for out-of-network services, but using the in-network cost-sharing provisions instead of the out-of-network cost-sharing provisions; or (3) The amount that would be paid under Medicare for the emergency services, excluding any in-network copayment or coinsurance requirements. Section 34. For capitated or other health benefit plans that do not have a negotiated per-service amount for in-network providers, subdivision (1) of section 33 of this Act does not apply. Section 35. If a heath benefit plan has more than one negotiated amount for in-network providers for a particular emergency service, the amount in subdivision (1) of section 33 of this Act is the median of these negotiated amounts. Section 36. Any cost-sharing requirement other than a copayment or coinsurance requirement, such as a deductible or out-of-pocket maximum, may be imposed with respect to emergency services provided out-of-network if the cost-sharing requirement generally applies to out-of-network benefits. A deductible may be imposed with respect to out-of-network emergency services only as part of a deductible that generally applies to out-of-network benefits. If an out-of-pocket maximum generally applies to out-of-network benefits, that out-of-network maximum applies to out-of-network emergency services. Section 37. For immediately required post-evaluation or post-stabilization services, a health carrier shall provide access to a designated representative twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, to facilitate review, or otherwise provide coverage with no financial penalty to the covered person.

Section 39. A health carrier is responsible for monitoring all utilization review activities carried out by, or on behalf of, the health carrier and for ensuring that all requirements of sections 28 to 74, inclusive, of this Act, and applicable rules are met. The health carrier shall also ensure that appropriate personnel have operational responsibility for the conduct of the health carrier's utilization review program. Section 40.

Section 52. A health carrier shall maintain written procedures pursuant to sections 28 to 74, inclusive, of this Act, for making standard utilization review and benefit determinations on requests submitted to the health carrier by covered persons or their authorized representatives for benefits and for notifying covered persons and their authorized representatives of its determinations with respect to these requests within the specified time frames required under sections 28 to 74, inclusive, of this Act. If a period of time is extended as permitted by sections 28 to 74, inclusive, of this Act, due to a claimant's failure to submit information necessary to decide a prospective, retrospective, or disability claim, the period for making the benefit determination shall be tolled from the date on which the notification of the extension is sent to the claimant until the date on which the claimant responds to the request for additional information. Section 53.

The time period for making a determination and notifying the covered person or, if applicable, the covered person's authorized representative, of the determination pursuant to this section may be extended once by the health carrier for up to fifteen days, if the health carrier: (1) Determines that an extension is necessary due to matters beyond the health carrier's control; and (2) Notifies the covered person or, if applicable, the covered person's authorized representative, prior to the expiration of the initial fifteen-day time period, of the circumstances requiring the extension of time and the date by which the health carrier expects to make a determination. If the extension is necessary due to the failure of the covered person or the covered person's authorized representative to submit information necessary to reach a determination on the request, the notice of extension shall specifically describe the required information necessary to complete the request and give the covered person or, if applicable, the covered person's authorized representative at least forty-five days from the date of receipt of the notice to provide the specified information.

This notice shall be provided as soon as possible, but in no event later than five days following the date of the failure. The health carrier may provide the notice orally or, if requested by the covered person or the covered person's authorized representative, in writing. The provisions only apply in a case of failure that is a communication by a covered person or the covered person's authorized representative that is received by a person or organizational unit of the health carrier responsible for handling benefit matters and is a communication that refers to a specific covered person, a specific medical condition or symptom, and a specific health care service, treatment, or provider for which certification is being requested. Section 54.

The health care service or treatment that is the subject of the adverse determination shall be continued without liability to the covered person until the covered person has been notified of the determination by the health carrier with respect to the internal review request made pursuant to sections 75 to 87, inclusive, of this Act. Section 55. For retrospective review determinations, the health carrier shall make the determination within a reasonable period of time, but in no event later than thirty days after the date of receiving the benefit request. In the case of a certification, the health carrier may notify in writing the covered person and the provider rendering the service. If the determination is an adverse determination, the health carrier shall provide notice of the adverse determination to the covered person or, if applicable, the covered person's authorized representative, in accordance with section 57 of this Act.

If the extension under this section is necessary due to the failure of the covered person or, if applicable, the covered person's authorized representative to submit information necessary to reach a determination on the request, the notice of extension shall specifically describe the required information necessary to complete the request and give the covered person or, if applicable, the covered person's authorized representative at least forty-five days from the date of receipt of the notice to provide the specified information. Section 56. For purposes of calculating the time periods within which a determination is required to be made for prospective and retrospective reviews, the time period within which the determination is required to be made begins on the date the request is received by the health carrier in accordance with the health carrier's procedures established pursuant to section 41 of this Act. If the time period for making the determination for a prospective or retrospective review is extended due to the covered person or, if applicable, the covered person's authorized representative's failure to submit the information necessary to make the determination, the time period for making the determination shall be tolled from the date on which the health carrier sends the notification of the extension to the covered person or, if applicable, the covered person's authorized representative, until the earlier of: the date on which the covered person or, if applicable, the covered person's authorized representative, responds to the request for additional information or the date on which the specified information was to have been submitted. If the covered person or the covered person's authorized representative fails to submit the information before the end of the period of the extension, as specified in sections 53 and 55 of this Act, the health carrier may deny the certification of the requested benefit.
