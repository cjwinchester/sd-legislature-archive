The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States \u2013 South Dakota may reserve an additional one hundred eighty calendar days but shall not exceed three hundred sixty-five calendar days. Section 10. That chapter 43-2A be amended with a NEW SECTION: Upon written request from an applicant specifying the need for an accelerated review, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States \u2013 South Dakota may expedite its review. Section 11. That chapter 43-2A be amended with a NEW SECTION: The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States \u2013 South Dakota may request, in writing, from the applicant any document relevant to the committee\u2019s investigation, review, or recommendation, including: (1) Titles; (2) Deeds; (3) Real estate transaction documents; (4) Financing or other financial documents related to the transaction; (5) Documents provided during any prior CFIUS review of the same transaction on or after July 1, 2023; and (6) Any other document reasonably related to the agricultural land transaction. During the review period, the applicant shall respond to any follow-up request made by the committee in writing for documents. Section 12. That chapter 43-2A be amended with a NEW SECTION: In determining whether to recommend approval or denial of an agricultural land transaction to the Governor, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States \u2013 South Dakota shall consider: (1) The ownership or controlling interests of the applicant; (2) The continued classification of the real property as agricultural land; (3) The impact the subject agricultural land transaction would have on domestic security and public safety; (4) The proximity of the subject agricultural land to any public utility facility or appurtenance; any local, state, or federal government facility; or any critical infrastructure facility; (5) Whether the CFIUS issued a safe harbor letter, as described in 31 C.F.R. \u00a7 800.508(d) and section 7(f) of Presidential Executive Order 11858, as amended, for the same transaction; and (6) Any other factor reasonably and demonstrably related to public security that is deemed relevant by the committee. Section 13. That chapter 43-2A be amended with a NEW SECTION: The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States \u2013 South Dakota shall provide the applicant at least fourteen days' written notice to the applicant of the date, time, and place of the meeting where the committee will render a final decision regarding the agricultural land transaction. If, after weighing the factors in section 12 of this Act, the committee finds the transaction supports the purpose described in section 6 of this Act, the committee may recommend to the Governor approval of the transaction. If the Governor approves of the transaction, the committee shall issue the applicant an approval letter stating the committee recommended approval of the transaction and that the Governor approves the transaction. A transaction is no longer under the committee\u2019s jurisdiction upon the issuance of an approval letter, unless the parties provided false information to the committee or omitted material information in its application, responses to any committee questions, or documentation. The committee retains its jurisdiction over a transaction if any party to the agricultural land transaction provided false information or omitted material information during the committee\u2019s review process or in its submissions. No agricultural land transaction subject to this Act may occur in contravention of the procedures of the Act or without an approval letter issued by the committee. Any transaction that occurs in violation of this section is subject to forfeiture pursuant to \u00a7 43-2A-6. If, after weighing the factors in section 12 of this Act, the committee finds the transaction undermines the purpose described in section 6 of this Act or discovers material information that contradicts the information provided by the applicant, the committee may recommend in writing that the Governor deny the transaction. The committee shall include findings of fact, the factors weighed in reaching those findings, and the reason the transaction should be denied. Any applicant may, within ten calendar days of the notification that the committee recommends that the Governor deny the application, but before the Governor renders a final decision, submit any arguments in writing to the Governor disputing or otherwise setting forth the applicant\u2019s reasons why the Governor should disagree with the committee\u2019s recommendations. Section 14. That chapter 43-2A be amended with a NEW SECTION: Upon receipt of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States \u2013 South Dakota\u2019s written recommendation that the subject agricultural land transaction be approved or denied and giving due consideration to any submission in response by the applicant, the Governor shall review the agricultural land transaction for a period not exceeding thirty calendar days beginning on the day of the Governor's receipt of the committee's recommendation. During the Governor\u2019s review period, the Governor may seek clarification in writing of the information and recommendations provided or request further information as part of the review process. The committee shall respond to the Governor's request within three business days of the request. Section 15. That chapter 43-2A be amended with a NEW SECTION: After completing the review, the Governor may either approve or deny the subject agricultural land transaction by notifying the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States \u2013 South Dakota in writing of the decision within the review period. If the Governor approves the agricultural land transaction, the committee shall hold a public hearing within ten days of receiving notice from the Governor and issue an approval letter for the agricultural land transaction. If the Governor denies the agricultural land transaction, the committee shall hold a public hearing within ten days of receiving notice from the Governor of the decision. Any transaction denied by the Governor is a prohibited transaction as a matter of law. If the Governor fails to act within the review period prescribed in section 14 of this Act, the committee\u2019s recommendation is deemed final action. For any hearing required by this section, the committee shall provide notice of the hearing to the applicant at least ten days before the scheduled hearing. Section 16. That chapter 43-2A be amended with a NEW SECTION: An applicant may withdraw an application during the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States \u2013 South Dakota\u2019s review period. Any withdrawal must be made in writing to the committee, except as provided in section 8 of this Act. If the committee receives a written withdrawal request during its review period, the committee must permit the party to withdraw. Withdrawal is not permitted after the committee transmits its recommendation to approve or deny the subject agricultural land transaction to the Governor or during the Governor\u2019s review period. Section 17. That chapter 43-2A be amended with a NEW SECTION: A party may reapply for the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States \u2013 South Dakota's review after voluntarily withdrawing an application. A withdrawn transaction may be resubmitted to the committee for review: (1) If the applicant has new information related to the agricultural land transaction; (2) If the applicant has added new parties to the agricultural land transaction, but the structure of the transaction remains the same as the withdrawn transaction; (3) If the funding or financing of the agricultural land transaction changed; or (4) For any other reason the parties seek review of the agricultural land transaction. Any review of an agricultural land transaction that was previously withdrawn is in the committee\u2019s sole discretion. Should the committee deny review of a previously withdrawn transaction, the committee shall notify the parties in writing. The committee may consider the fact a transaction was previously withdrawn as a factor in its findings of fact. Section 18. That chapter 43-2A be amended with a NEW SECTION: An official meeting of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States \u2013 South Dakota is subject to chapter 1-25. The deliberations of the committee concerning agricultural land transactions are confidential and are exempt from public disclosure, including any documentary material or data made or received by the committee. Any letter recommending approval or denial of an agricultural land transaction is a public record, but any record or information contained therein that is exempt from public disclosure pursuant to chapter 1-27 may be redacted. Section 19. That \u00a7 7-9-7 be AMENDED: 7-9-7.

or (5) A transfer on death deed, pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 29A-6-401 to 29A-6-435, inclusive, is exempt from completing and submitting the certificate of value as set forth in subdivision (4) of this section.; or (6) Any deed for agricultural land, as defined in \u00a7 43-2A-1, that is subject to the jurisdiction of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States \u2013 South Dakota that is not accompanied by an approval letter issued under section 15 of this Act."}], "amendments": [{"bill_id": 23951, "document_id": 249606, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/249606.pdf", "legislator_profile_id": 4404, "document_id_instructions": 249607, "document_id_instructions_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/249607.pdf"}, {"bill_id": 23951, "document_id": 249649, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/249649.pdf", "legislator_profile_id": 4426, "document_id_instructions": 249651, "document_id_instructions_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/249651.pdf"}, {"bill_id": 23951, "document_id": 249770, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/249770.pdf", "legislator_profile_id": 4426, "document_id_instructions": 249778, "document_id_instructions_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/249778.pdf"}], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 23951, "action_date": "2023-02-01T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 247759, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/247759.pdf", "status_text": "First read in Senate and referred to", "journal_page": 160, "committee_id_action": 1183, "committee_id_assigned": 1171, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 23951, "action_date": "2023-02-14T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 249090, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/249090.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 1, "committee_id_action": 1171, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 23951, "action_date": "2023-02-14T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 249091, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/249091.pdf", "status_text": "Motion to amend", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 1171, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 23951, "action_date": "2023-02-14T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 249091, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/249091.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass Amended", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 1171, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 77129, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [4381, 4466, 4460, 4395, 4426, 4448, 4399]}}, {"bill_id": 23951, "action_date": "2023-02-16T13:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 249591, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/249591.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to another day", "journal_page": 291, "committee_id_action": 1183, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 23951, "action_date": "2023-02-21T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 249697, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/249697.pdf", "status_text": "Motion to amend", "journal_page": 304, "committee_id_action": 1183, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 23951, "action_date": "2023-02-21T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 249697, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/249697.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass Amended", "journal_page": 306, "committee_id_action": 1183, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "F", "vote": {"vote_id": 77363, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [4336, 4342, 4360, 4381, 4382, 4386, 4395, 4399, 4419, 4426, 4432], "Nay": [4338, 4339, 4340, 4345, 4348, 4448, 4355, 4359, 4457, 4372, 4378, 4453, 4466, 4460, 4394, 4404, 4407, 4410, 4413, 4414, 4430, 4434, 4436], "Excused": [4352]}}, {"bill_id": 23951, "action_date": "2023-02-21T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 249697, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/249697.pdf", "status_text": "Intent to reconsider", "journal_page": 306, "committee_id_action": 1183, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 23951, "action_date": "2023-02-22T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 249840, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/249840.pdf", "status_text": "No motion to reconsider", "journal_page": 316, "committee_id_action": 1183, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}]}
