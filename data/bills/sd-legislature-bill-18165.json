The South Dakota Statuary Commission is a nonprofit corporation, independent and separate from the State of South Dakota and subject to the laws governing nonprofit corporations. The purpose of the commission is to promote the culture and heritage of South Dakota's past, present, and future through the creation, design, construction, placement, and display of statues that realistically depict and represent South Dakota and its people, heritage, history, and culture and to raise money or other consideration to achieve that goal. The board may accept any grants, gifts, or contributions as allowed by South Dakota's nonprofit corporation law but may not accept any state appropriation. Section 2. The secretary of state, the secretary of the Department of Tourism and State Development, and the Speaker of the House of Representatives shall meet within ninety days of the effective date of this Act to incorporate the commission, to create the initial bylaws of the commission, and to choose the members of the first board of directors.

The board shall meet as necessary to conduct its business by a call of the chair. Section 5. Any publicly owned lands and highways of the federal government, the State of South Dakota, and its political subdivisions are eligible for the placement of statues. On a case- by-case basis, the commission may place statues on privately owned land or outside the boundaries of the state if such placement meets the purposes of this Act as stated in section 1 of this Act Section 6. The board members shall receive per diem and expenses while actually engaged in duties related to the commission. The board may either hire office personnel or may enter into contractual agreements to carry out its duties. Section 7. The board shall deposit in the state treasury all moneys coming into the custody of the board at least weekly. Expenditures shall only be paid on warrants drawn and approved by not less than two board members. Section 8. No person may reproduce, duplicate, or otherwise use a facsimile of any statue constructed, produce, or created by or for the commission, for any for-profit, commercial purpose without specific written authorization from the board. A violation of this section is a Class 1 misdemeanor. Section 9. The board may enter into contracts for the marketing and sale of items or objects authorized under this Act. The board may charge a fee for any authorization granted under the terms of this Act. Section 10. The board shall work and cooperate with the Bureau of Administration and other agencies of the State of South Dakota, the federal government, and local government entities for construction and placement of statues in areas that will enhance the enjoyment and understanding of each individual statue. Statues should be placed in a highly visible manner so as to enhance access and visibility of the statue to the public. Statues should be placed to allow for the placement or addition of interpretive and explanatory material and exhibits in the immediate vicinity of the statue."}, {"bill_id": 18165, "bill_version_id": 97721, "bill_version": "Senate State Affairs Engrossed", "bill_version_date": "2003-02-22T00:00:00-06:00", "bill_text": "FOR AN ACT ENTITLED, An Act to authorize a South Dakota Statuary Commission.
