BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That chapter 10-6 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: The board of county commissioners may create a neighborhood tax assessment district for nonagricultural property classified pursuant to \u00a7 10-6-31 if there is evidence that unique and special circumstances exist causing the market value of the property to be twenty percent more than the value of the property if the income or cost approached is used to determine the value. If a neighborhood tax assessment district is created, the board of county commissioners shall require the director of equalization to separately assess the property using the market approach. The assessed value determined by the income or cost approach shall be used as the taxable value for the property. The assessed value determined by the market approach shall be used as the deferred taxable value for the property to determine the amount of deferred taxes due on the property when it is sold. Section 2. That chapter 10-6 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: The assessment procedure in section 1 of this Act may be applied to nonagricultural property if the owner of the property has owned, in fee or by contract to purchase, for at least three years. The owner of the property in a neighborhood established pursuant to section 1 of this Act shall apply by September first to the director of equalization to have the owner's property assessed and taxed pursuant to this Act. Section 3. That chapter 10-6 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Capacity of the property to produce income shall be based on actual income for the five-year period immediately preceding the tax year in issue. In determining the capacity to produce income, the director of equalization or the county board of equalization may take into consideration the income produced from and value of similar property in other areas in the county. Section 4. That chapter 10-6 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: The director of equalization shall assess the property using the market approach to determine the deferred taxable value. The assessor shall maintain a record of the deferred taxable value until the property is sold or use is changed. After the property is sold the director of equalization shall provide the deferred taxable value for the previous five years to determine the amount of the deferred taxes due. The property tax levies for the previous five years shall be applied to the market value to calculate the total amount of property tax due during that period. The owner shall receive credit for the property taxes paid based on the income or cost approach during that five-year period. The owner of the property during the property tax deferment shall pay the amount of deferred property taxes upon the sale of the property to the county treasurer. The deferred property taxes are not payable if the owner sells or conveys the property to a person related to the owner by blood, marriage, or adoption, the property passes to a person related to the decedent by blood, marriage, or adoption by will or intestacy, or a corporation transfers or passes the property to a principal shareholder. Section 5. That chapter 10-6 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Property taxes which the county defers pursuant to this Act shall become a lien on the property for which the taxes are deferred. The county shall file a copy of the lien with the register of deeds. No property on which the county deferred payment of property taxes may be transferred unless the property taxes are paid in full. Section 6. That chapter 10-6 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: The owner of the property may appeal the taxable value and the deferred taxable value of the property in the same manner as other property values are appealed. Section 7. That chapter 10-6 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: The secretary of revenue may enter into contracts for the collection of rent and income information by county for nonagricultural property. The secretary of revenue may promulgate rules pursuant to chapter 1-26 concerning the: (1) Collection and analyzation of rent and income information; (2) Definition of comparable property pursuant to this Act; (3) Procedure to determine and record the deferred taxable value of property; and (4) Application and collection of the deferred taxes. Section 8. That chapter 10-6 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Any revenue received by the county from the payment of deferred property taxes shall be offset by a corresponding decrease in revenue payable from taxes on real property that the county levies for its next budget. The county may include the amount in the budget from the payment of deferred property taxes pursuant to section 4 of this Act to calculate the amount of revenue payable from taxes on real property in the following year."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 13202, "action_date": "1998-01-13T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 76883, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/76883.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 22, "committee_id_action": 600, "committee_id_assigned": 596, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 13202, "action_date": "1998-01-20T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 76517, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/76517.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 596, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 13202, "action_date": "1998-01-20T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 76517, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/76517.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to another day", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 596, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 13202, "action_date": "1998-01-29T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 76602, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/76602.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 596, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 13202, "action_date": "1998-02-03T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 76636, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/76636.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 596, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 13202, "action_date": "1998-02-03T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 76636, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/76636.pdf", "status_text": "Tabled", "journal_page": 360, "committee_id_action": 596, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 40237, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [2096, 2153, 2172, 2193, 2197], "Yea": [2098, 2117, 2126, 2168, 2097, 2147, 2164, 2111]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/13202"}
