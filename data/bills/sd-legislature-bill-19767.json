Section 13. No qualifying patient or primary caregiver not complying with the permitted scope of the medical use of marijuana may be afforded protection against searches and seizures pertaining to the misapplication of the medical use of marijuana. Section 14. No person is subject to arrest or prosecution for simply being in the presence or vicinity of the medical use of marijuana as permitted under this Act. Section 15.
