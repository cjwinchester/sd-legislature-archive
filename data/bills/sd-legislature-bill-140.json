BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 12-4-36 be amended to read as follows: 12-4-36. There is a rebuttable presumption that the signer of a petition filed pursuant to chapter 2-1, 6-16, 7-18A, 9-13, 9-20, 12-6, 12-7, or 13-7 is not a qualified elector if the signer's name fails to appear on the active or inactive voter registration list of the county stated on the petition as the signer's county of registration on the date the petition was signed. This rebuttable presumption may only be overcome by clear and convincing evidence presented by the petition sponsor, circulator, or candidate. Section 2. That \u00a7 12-5-1 be amended to read as follows: 12-5-1. A new political party may be organized and participate in the primary election by filing with the secretary of state not later than the last Tuesday of March at five p.m. prior to the date of the primary election, a written declaration signed by at least two and one-half percent of the voters of the state as shown by the total vote cast for Governor at the last preceding gubernatorial election, which declaration shall contain: (1) The name of the proposed party; and (2) A brief statement of the principles thereof; whereupon the party shall, under the party name chosen, have all the rights of a political party whose ticket was on the ballot at the preceding general election. No signature on a declaration is valid if the declaration was signed more than one year prior to filing of the declaration. A political party loses the right to participate in the primary election for failure to meet the definition of political party as defined in \u00a7 12-1-3. The national and state chairperson of a recognized political party may request in writing, subscribed and sworn to by each chairperson before any officer qualified to administer oaths and take acknowledgments, to no longer be recognized as a political party. The political party shall also comply with the requirements for dissolution pursuant to chapter 12-27. Section 3. That \u00a7 12-6-8 be amended to read as follows: 12-6-8. No person shall may sign the nominating petition of a candidate before January first in the year in which the election is to be held, nor for whom he the person is not entitled to vote, nor for a political candidate of a party of which he the person is not a member, nor of more than the number of candidates required to be nominated for the same office. There shall be added by either the signer or the circulator, the signer's place of residence, and the date of signing. The signer's post office box number may be given in lieu of a street address if the signer lives within a municipality of the second or third class. A formal declaration of the candidate shall be signed by him the circulator prior to the circulation of petitions. The signed declaration of the candidate, or a facsimile thereof, may accompany and be a part of the petition. The original signed declaration shall accompany the group of petitions upon filing. Such The petition shall be verified under oath by the persons circulating the same petition. The verification by the person circulating the petition may not be notarized by the candidate whom the petition is nominating. The provisions of this section shall may not prohibit a person registered with party affiliation from signing either a petition nominating an independent or a nonpolitical candidate for office if he the person has not previously signed a petition for that office to be filled. Section 4. That \u00a7 12-26-15 be amended to read as follows: 12-26-15.
