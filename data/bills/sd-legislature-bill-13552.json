WHEREAS, the United States is a signatory to the 1992 Rio Framework Convention on Global Climate Change and has participated in international negotiations pursuant to a United Nations agreement negotiated in Berlin in 1995 to expand the scope of the Rio Convention; and WHEREAS, the Berlin Mandate required the United States and other advanced industrial nations (\"Annex I parties\") to negotiate legally binding quantified emission limitation and reduction objectives for greenhouse gases for the post-2000 period without increasing the responsibilities of non-Annex I developing countries; and WHEREAS, the United States and other Annex I parties to the Rio Convention on December 10, 1997, in Kyoto, Japan, agreed to the \"Kyoto Protocol\" that would require industrialized nations to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide by six percent below 1990 levels by the years 2008-2012; and WHEREAS, manmade emissions of greenhouse gases are caused primarily by the combustion of oil, coal, and natural gas fuels by industries, automobiles, and other consumptive uses of energy; and WHEREAS, the United States relies on fossil fuels for more than ninety percent of its total energy supply and has among the lowest energy prices among all industrial nations; and WHEREAS, the United States will have great difficulty in meeting its emission reduction target due to economic and population growth, notwithstanding the development of numerous energy conservation and efficiency programs implemented by government and industry; and WHEREAS, developing countries exempt from the Kyoto Protocol are expected to increase their rates of economic growth and fossil fuel use over the next two decades and to surpass the United States and other Annex I parties in total emissions of greenhouse gases; and WHEREAS, the imposition of legally binding requirements for the reduction of greenhouse gases by the United States and other Annex I parties would entail fundamental changes in our patterns of energy production, consumption, and prices with potentially severe adverse implications for workers, consumers, and industries dependent upon the production or use of fossil fuel; and WHEREAS, the exemption in the Kyoto Protocol for emission control obligations by developing countries could create an unfair competitive imbalance between industrial and developing nations to the detriment of job growth and economic development in the United States; and WHEREAS, the Kyoto Protocol could lead to the transfer of energy-intensive industries overseas and increased emissions of greenhouse gases by developing nations, thereby offsetting any environmental benefits associated with reductions achieved by the United States and other Annex I parties; and WHEREAS, emission reductions by Annex I parties alone cannot meaningfully change future concentrations of atmospheric greenhouse gases or avert the risk of environmental damage from climate change without global participation in the Rio Convention; and WHEREAS, the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions can be achieved most cost- effectively by the gradual retirement and replacement of existing buildings, appliances, industrial plants, equipment, and vehicles with more energy-efficient alternatives: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the House of Representatives of the Seventy- third Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the Senate concurring therein, that this body calls upon the United States Senate not to ratify any commitments pursuant to the Kyoto Protocol that could lead to the loss of jobs, income, or economic development in the United States without definite commitments by developing nations to participate in future global greenhouse emission reduction efforts; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Legislature of South Dakota calls upon the President of the Unites States to renegotiate the Kyoto Protocol or to take other appropriate steps to ensure that all nations have made equal commitments to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, and to provide a timetable for emission reduction by Annex I parties consistent with the orderly retirement and replacement of existing capital stock and equipment; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Legislature of South Dakota calls upon the United States Senate to reject any proposed protocol or other amendment to the Rio Convention that is inconsistent with this resolution or that does not ensure that at least seventy-five percent of the signatory parties to the Rio Convention, as measured by their 1995 populations, would be legally bound by the terms of an emission reduction program undertaken pursuant to the proposed protocol or other amendment; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that suitable copies of this resolution be forwarded to the President of the United States and the Majority and Minority Leaders of the United States Senate."}, {"bill_id": 13552, "bill_version_id": 78196, "bill_version": "Enrolled", "bill_version_date": "1998-02-17T00:00:00-06:00", "bill_text": "January 23, 1998 February 13, 1998"}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 13552, "action_date": "1998-01-23T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 76561, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/76561.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 595, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 13552, "action_date": "1998-01-23T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 76561, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/76561.pdf", "status_text": "Adopt Resolution", "journal_page": 195, "committee_id_action": 595, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 39744, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [2100, 2106, 2111, 2134, 2141, 2177, 2150, 2180, 2171, 2131], "Excused": [2146, 2136], "Nay": [2159]}}, {"bill_id": 13552, "action_date": "1998-01-26T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 76901, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/76901.pdf", "status_text": "Adopt Resolution", "journal_page": 219, "committee_id_action": 600, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 40430, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [2096, 2098, 2100, 2101, 2104, 2105, 2106, 2107, 2108, 2110, 2113, 2114, 2116, 2117, 2119, 2120, 2123, 2124, 2126, 2127, 2128, 2131, 2132, 2133, 2139, 2141, 2143, 2144, 2146, 2147, 2151, 2152, 2153, 2154, 2157, 2160, 2161, 2162, 2163, 2164, 2167, 2168, 2171, 2172, 2173, 2176, 2177, 2178, 2180, 2181, 2183, 2185, 2186, 2190, 2192, 2193, 2194, 2195, 2197, 2198, 2134], "Nay": [2097, 2109, 2136, 2150, 2159], "Excused": [2111, 2158, 2174, 2184]}}, {"bill_id": 13552, "action_date": "1998-02-13T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 76734, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/76734.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 583, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 13552, "action_date": "1998-02-13T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 76734, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/76734.pdf", "status_text": "Concur In resolution", "journal_page": 502, "committee_id_action": 583, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 38879, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [2121, 2125, 2166, 2140, 2179, 2137], "Nay": [2122, 2156, 2196]}}, {"bill_id": 13552, "action_date": "1998-02-14T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 76932, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/76932.pdf", "status_text": "Concur In resolution", "journal_page": 531, "committee_id_action": 601, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 38993, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [2094, 2095, 2102, 2103, 2115, 2118, 2121, 2125, 2129, 2130, 2135, 2137, 2138, 2140, 2142, 2145, 2148, 2149, 2155, 2165, 2166, 2169, 2175, 2179, 2182, 2187, 2188, 2191], "Excused": [2099], "Nay": [2112, 2122, 2156, 2170, 2189, 2196]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/13552"}
