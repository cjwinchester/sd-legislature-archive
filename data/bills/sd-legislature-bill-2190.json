For all documentation offered by the applicant to provide evidence of identity, date of birth, social security number or nonwork authorized status, address of principal residence, and lawful status, the department shall make a copy of the documentation and shall retain the copy for ten years. All documents retained under this section are confidential. The examiner may, as part of a documented exceptions process, accept other evidence of identity and date of birth of any applicant and lawful status of any United States citizen only if the examiner is satisfied that the applicant cannot, for good reason beyond the applicant's control, produce such primary documents.
