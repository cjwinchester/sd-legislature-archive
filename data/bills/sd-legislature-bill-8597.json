BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 39-14-55.1 be repealed. 39-14-55.1. All ruminant livestock feed distributed in South Dakota shall contain a statement on the label declaring whether or not the feed was produced in a feed manufacturing facility that handles or stores any ingredient or product containing an ingredient that is prohibited from use in livestock feed pursuant to 21 CFR 589.2000, as amended to March 1, 2001. The secretary of agriculture shall provide the appropriate format for such label statements in rules promulgated pursuant to chapter 1-26. Section 2. That \u00a7 39-14-60 be amended to read: 39-14-60. The secretary of agriculture may promulgate rules, pursuant to chapter 1-26, for commercial feeds and pet foods: (1) To provide procedures for registration of commercial feed; (2) To provide procedures for contested case hearings and commercial feed registration amendments; (3) To provide guidelines for commercial feed records; (4) To provide guidelines for commercial feed good manufacturing practices; (5) To establish weed seed adulteration limits; (6) To establish labeling standards for commercial feed; (7) To establish customer-formula feed directions and warning and caution statements for labels; and (8) To provide procedures for entry into premises and access to records by department personnel for the purpose of inspecting commercial feed manufacturing practices; and (9) For the express purpose of protecting the public health, welfare, and safety and the health and welfare of the South Dakota Livestock Industry, to regulate the use, manufacture, storage, or distribution of ruminant livestock feeds if animal proteins as defined in 21 CFR 589.2000, as amended to March 1, 2001, are present in the manufacturing, storage, or distribution facility or premises. In the interest of uniformity, the secretary by rule shall consider and may adopt the regulations, official definition of feed ingredients and official feed terms adopted by the Association of American Feed Control Officials and published in the official publication of that organization and any regulation promulgated pursuant to the authority of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. \u00a7 301, et seq.), provided that the secretary may under this chapter promulgate such rules. Section 3. That ARSD 12:53:01:14 be repealed. 12:53:01:14...Format of advisory statements on labels of ruminant livestock feeds. Complete and mixed supplement ruminant livestock feeds manufactured in a facility that handles or stores any ingredient, or product containing an ingredient, prohibited from use in ruminant livestock feed pursuant to the Code of Federal Regulations, 21 C.F.R. 589.2000, as amended to March 1, 2001, shall state on the label, \"This product was made in a feed manufacturing facility that handles or stores products containing animal proteins prohibited in ruminant feed.\" Complete and mixed supplement ruminant livestock feeds manufactured in a facility that does not handle or store any ingredient, or product containing an ingredient, that is prohibited from use in ruminant livestock feed pursuant to the Code of Federal Regulations, 21 C.F.R. 589.2000, as amended to March 1, 2001, shall state on the label, \"This product was made in a feed manufacturing facility that does not handle or store products containing animal proteins prohibited in ruminant feed.\" This includes facilities that store prohibited materials in separate buildings or in an area that is physically separated by a wall or similar means that prevents the commingling of prohibited and nonprohibited materials. Commercial feeds, other than customer formula feeds, shall be labeled with the appropriate statement on the principal display panel of the product label. For customer formula feeds, the appropriate statement shall appear on the label, invoice, delivery ticket, or other shipping document. The Secretary of Agriculture may consider alternative methods of communicating the required information if a written request is submitted by the manufacturer and the proposed alternative provides an equivalent level of communication to the consumer. Section 4. That ARSD 12:53:01:15 be repealed. 12:53:01:15...Handling or storage of prohibited animal protein products in facilities that manufacture ruminant livestock feeds. Any person who manufactures ruminant livestock feed for distribution or for the person's own use, may not handle in any equipment, or store in the feed manufacturing facility or other areas used for the storage of materials for the production of ruminant livestock feeds or for feeding to ruminants, any ingredient or product containing an ingredient that is prohibited from use in ruminant livestock feeds pursuant to the Code of Federal Regulations, 21 C.F.R. 589.2000, as amended to March 1, 2001. Storage may occur in the same building if there is a physical separation of prohibited and nonprohibited materials with a wall or similar means that prevents the commingling of prohibited and nonprohibited materials. Section 5. That ARSD 12:53:01:16 be repealed. 12:53:01:16...Handling or storage of prohibited animal protein products by persons that transport or store ruminant livestock feeds. Any person who transports or stores nonpackaged bulk ruminant livestock feed for further distribution or for his own use, may not handle prohibited animal proteins in any distribution equipment, or store in the same building with nonpackaged bulk ruminant livestock feeds or materials for the production of ruminant livestock feeds, any ingredient or product containing an ingredient that is prohibited from use in ruminant livestock feeds pursuant to the Code of Federal Regulations, 21 C.F.R. 589.2000, as amended to March 1, 2001.
