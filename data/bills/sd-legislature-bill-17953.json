BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That chapter 13-13 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: When each school district's entitlement under the provisions of this chapter is determined, the secretary of the Department of Education and Cultural Affairs shall determine the amount by which any money appropriated as state aid to general education exceeds the statewide entitlement provided for under the provisions of this chapter. This amount shall be distributed to school districts as provided in this section. If any school district's state aid to education amount is less than the district received in either of the two previous fiscal years, the district shall receive additional funding so that the district receives an amount of state aid to education money equal to the highest amount that the district received in either of the two previous fiscal years. If funds are not sufficient to meet the requirements of this section, the funds shall be distributed to school districts on a pro rata basis. Section 2. This Act is repealed on July 1, 2004."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 17953, "action_date": "2003-01-29T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 96046, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/96046.pdf", "status_text": "First read in Senate and referred to", "journal_page": 229, "committee_id_action": 799, "committee_id_assigned": 774, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 17953, "action_date": "2003-02-04T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 96481, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/96481.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 774, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 17953, "action_date": "2003-02-06T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 96672, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/96672.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 774, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 17953, "action_date": "2003-02-11T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 96932, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/96932.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to 41st legislative day", "journal_page": 402, "committee_id_action": 774, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 56400, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [2851, 2916, 2928, 2868, 2908], "Excused": [2852, 2886]}}, {"bill_id": 17953, "action_date": "2003-02-11T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 96932, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/96932.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 774, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/17953"}
