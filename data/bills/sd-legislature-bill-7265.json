WHEREAS, family caregivers play a vital role in enabling frail seniors, people with serious health challenges, people with special needs, and others requiring assistance with activites of daily living to remain in their homes; and WHEREAS, enabling people to remain at home for as long as possible is both more compassionate and more affordable than institutional care, which comes at a high cost, often supported by taxes; and WHEREAS, in South Dakota, 84,600 family caregivers provide 79 million hours of care, an estimated economic value of $1.03 billion, valued at $13.12 per hour; and WHEREAS, by 2025, South Dakotans attaining the age of 65 will increase by approximately 100,000, making up over twenty percent of the population in all but nine counties. In eleven counties, they will make up over forty percent of the population; and WHEREAS, over thirty percent of adults age 60 and above have one or more disabilities, including disabilities that affect self care; and WHEREAS, medical advances allow millions to live much longer with chronic illnesses, increasing the requirement for caregiving; and WHEREAS, the stress imposed on families by caregiving is a health risk factor that warrants attention as a public health issue; and WHEREAS, caregiving imposes significant financial burdens on both caregivers and employers, affecting the economy and contributing to the impoverishment of families; and WHEREAS, nationally, caregiver services were valued at $470 billion per year in 2013; and WHEREAS, the Alzheimer's Association estimates that one in nine Americans aged 65 and older are affected with the condition: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the Senate of the Ninety-First Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the House of Representatives concurring therein, that we recognize and support the important role that family caregivers play in South Dakota; that we support policies and initiatives to provide the support and training needed to make family caregiving more feasible, affordable, and effective; that we encourage efforts at the state and county level to analyze population demographic trends to determine both current and future service requirements for care recipients and caregivers, and to permit data-driven policy and program recommendations about our aging populations and the workforce development needed to empower those who need care to heal, age, and live in place; that we encourage employers to establish policies that recognize the impact that caregiving can have on workers, and encourage employers to find ways to support their workers during difficult family times; and that we encourage the creation of volunteer caregiver corps, to provide nonmedical assistance and companionship to frail elders at no public expense."}, {"bill_id": 7265, "bill_version_id": 38209, "bill_version": "Enrolled", "bill_version_date": "2016-01-27T09:52:07.343-06:00", "bill_text": ""}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 7265, "action_date": "2016-01-21T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 37871, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/37871.pdf", "status_text": "First Reading", "journal_page": 100, "committee_id_action": 309, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 7265, "action_date": "2016-01-22T13:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 37958, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/37958.pdf", "status_text": "Adopt Resolution", "journal_page": 114, "committee_id_action": 309, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 20216, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [974, 977, 999, 1037, 1014, 1067, 979, 969, 1005, 1047, 998, 1035, 984, 994, 1041, 967, 975, 1011, 1010, 1020, 971, 1016, 1001, 1046, 1066, 1012, 1045, 1000, 970, 978, 1013, 973, 1008], "Excused": [966, 997]}}, {"bill_id": 7265, "action_date": "2016-01-25T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 38058, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/38058.pdf", "status_text": "First Reading", "journal_page": 160, "committee_id_action": 325, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 7265, "action_date": "2016-01-26T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 38155, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/38155.pdf", "status_text": "Concurred in Resolution", "journal_page": 177, "committee_id_action": 325, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 20282, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [1043, 1042, 1063, 983, 1057, 964, 1040, 995, 1039, 986, 1050, 1060, 1009, 1033, 980, 985, 976, 1049, 1022, 1056, 1061, 1021, 1002, 1019, 1065, 972, 963, 1062, 1038, 987, 982, 1055, 1044, 1017, 1058, 1036, 1048, 1024, 1003, 968, 1018, 1059, 1054, 1031, 1027, 1028, 992, 1034, 1006, 991, 1007, 1052, 1030, 988, 993, 1026, 981, 1023, 1069, 1029, 996, 990, 1032, 1025, 1051, 965, 1053, 1064, 989], "Excused": [1015]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/7265"}
