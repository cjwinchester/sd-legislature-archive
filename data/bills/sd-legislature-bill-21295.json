BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 13-53-6 be amended to read as follows: 13-53-6. The board shall fix all rates of tuition and other fees to be paid by students. However, the board may not increase the rate of tuition paid by a student seeking a baccalaureate degree who remains continuously enrolled full-time for a period of up to four academic years, which is equal to eight consecutive fall and spring terms. The restriction on increasing the rate of tuition in this section does not apply if the student's enrollment is not continuous, if the student enrolls part-time rather than full-time, or once the student earns a baccalaureate degree or once the student's continuous enrollment extends beyond a period of four academic years. The provisions of this section are subject to any outstanding covenants with the holders of bonds issued by the Board of Regents or the South Dakota Building Authority. 250 copies of this document were printed by the South Dakota Legislative Research Council at a cost of $.038 per page. . Insertions into existing statutes are indicated by underscores. Deletions from existing statutes are indicated by overstrikes."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 21295, "action_date": "2007-01-26T12:15:00-06:00", "document_id": 110958, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/110958.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 225, "committee_id_action": 923, "committee_id_assigned": 912, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 21295, "action_date": "2007-02-02T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 111469, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/111469.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 912, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 21295, "action_date": "2007-02-02T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 111469, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/111469.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to 41st legislative day", "journal_page": 324, "committee_id_action": 912, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 66733, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [3577, 3579, 3587, 3591, 3599, 3604, 3614, 3635, 3643, 3649, 3674, 3675, 3613], "Excused": [3665], "Nay": [3671]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/21295"}
