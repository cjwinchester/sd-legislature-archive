BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 10-45-61 be amended to read as follows: 10-45-61. Notwithstanding \u00a7 10-54-1, a seller, who possesses an exemption certificate from a purchaser of tangible personal property, any product transferred electronically, or services which indicates the items or services being purchased are exempt, may rely on the exemption certificate and not charge sales tax to the provider of the exemption certificate until the provider of the exemption certificate gives notice that the items or services being purchased are no longer exempt by filing a new exemption certificate with the seller. The exemption certificate shall be signed by the purchaser,. The exemption certificate shall provide the purchaser's name, address, and valid state tax license number, if applicable, and shall describe the types of tangible personal property, any product transferred electronically, and services being purchased exempt by the purchaser. However, any person filing an electronic exemption certificate is not required to sign the exemption certificate. The purchaser claiming the protection of an exemption certificate is responsible for assuring that the goods and services delivered thereafter are of a type covered by the exemption certificate. If there are items covered under the exemption certificate which are not being purchased exempt, it is the responsibility of the purchaser when ordering goods from a seller to indicate if any of the items purchased are not exempt, and the appropriate sales tax shall be charged on the portion of the sale that is not exempt. A seller of property, any product transferred electronically, or services which are generally described under the exemption certificate is not responsible for the collection of the tax unless otherwise directed by the purchaser. If the purchaser later determines there is any tax due and owing, the purchaser shall remit the tax owed by the purchaser to the state. If the purchaser makes an exempt purchase and later determines that the goods or services purchased are not exempt, the purchaser shall report the transaction and pay the use tax on the next filing of the purchaser's return. Any purchaser who knowingly and intentionally lists on an exemption certificate personal property, any product transferred electronically, or services which the purchaser knows, at the time the exemption certificate is filed with the seller, are not exempt, or provides an invalid exemption certificate files an exemption certificate with a retailer in order to purchase tangible personal property, any product transferred electronically, or services with the intent to evade payment of the tax, and fails to timely report the same with the department is guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor. The secretary of revenue and regulation may assess a penalty of up to fifty percent of the tax owed, in addition to the tax owed. No interest may be charged on the penalty. The seller shall retain the exemption certificate for a period of three years from the date it is filed by the purchaser and provide the exemption certificate to the department upon request. The secretary may promulgate rules pursuant to chapter 1-26 to adopt forms for exemption certificates."}, {"bill_id": 1634, "bill_version_id": 12187, "bill_version": "Enrolled", "bill_version_date":
