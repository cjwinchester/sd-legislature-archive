That chapter 21-22 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: An accounting by a trustee of a court supervised trust and the final approval thereof by a court is conclusive against all persons in any way interested in the trust, and the trustee, absent fraud, intentional misrepresentation, or material omission, shall be released and discharged from any and all liability as to all matters set forth in the accounting. For purposes of this section, the term, accounting, means any annual, interim, or final report or other statement provided by a trustee reflecting all transactions, receipts, and disbursements during the reporting period and a list of assets as of the end of the period covered by the report or statement. Section 4. That chapter 55-4 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Unless the terms of the trust refer to this section and provide otherwise, a power exercisable by or attributable to a person, other than the settlor, in such person's capacity as a trustee to make discretionary distribution of either principal or income: (1) To or for the benefit of himself or herself shall be exercisable by the person only for the person's health, education, maintenance, and support in the person's accustomed manner of living; or (2) To or for the benefit of others, may not be exercisable to discharge any of the person's own legal obligations. Section 5. That chapter 55-4 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: The reference to trustee in section 4 of this Act includes any person who is deemed to have any power of a trustee, whether because such person has the right to remove or replace any trustee, or because a reciprocal trust or power doctrine applies, or otherwise.

Section 8. The grantor or a trustee of a trust, at any time after execution or creation of a trust, may execute a certificate of trust that sets forth less than all of the provisions of a trust instrument and any amendments to the instrument. The certificate of trust may be used for purposes of selling, conveying, pledging, mortgaging, leasing, or transferring title to any interest in real or personal property. The certificate of trust shall include: (1) The name of the trust, if one is given; (2) The date of the trust instrument; (3) The name of each grantor; (4) The name of each original trustee; (5) The name and address of each trustee empowered to act under the trust instrument at the time of execution of the certificate; (6) The following statement: \"The trustees are authorized by the instrument to sell, convey, pledge, mortgage, lease, or transfer title to any interest in real or personal property, except as limited by the following: (if none, so indicate)\"; (7) Any other trust provisions the grantors or trustees include; and (8) A statement as to whether the trust instrument has terminated or been revoked. The certificate of trust shall be upon the representation of the grantors or trustees that the statements contained in the certificate of trust are true and correct and that there are no other provisions in the trust instrument or amendments to it that limit the powers of the trustees to sell, convey, pledge, mortgage, lease, or transfer title to interests in real or personal property. The signature of the grantors or trustees shall be under oath before a notary public or other official authorized to administer oaths. Section 9. A certificate of trust executed under section 8 of this Act may be recorded in the Office of the Register of Deeds with respect to land described in the certificate of trust or any attachment to it. If it is recorded or filed in an county where real property is situated, or in the case of personal property, if it is presented to a third party, the certificate of trust serves to document the existence of the trust, the identity of the trustees, the powers of the trustees and any limitations on those powers, and other matters the certificate of trust sets out, as though the full trust instrument had been recorded, filed, or presented. Until amended or revoked under section 10 of this Act, or until the full trust instrument is recorded, filed, or presented, a certificate of trust is prima facie proof as to the matters contained in it and any party may rely upon the continued effectiveness of the certificate. Section 10. Amendment or revocation of a certificate of trust may be made only by a written instrument executed by the grantor or a trustee of a trust. Amendment or revocation of a certificate of trust is not effective as to a party unless that party has actual notice of the amendment or revocation. For purposes of this section, actual notice means that a written instrument of amendment or revocation has been received by the party or, in the case of real property, that either a written instrument or amendment or revocation has been received by the party or that a written instrument of amendment or revocation containing the legal description of the real property has been recorded in the Office of the Register of Deeds where the real property is situated. Section 11. Sections 8 to 10, inclusive, of this Act are effective July 1, 2000, but apply to trust instruments whenever created or executed. Section 12.
