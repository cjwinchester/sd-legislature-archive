WHEREAS, major multinational corporations and cooperatives are consolidating their economic control of the food and agriculture industry in numerous ways, with the ultimate effect of driving American farm families off the land or into a new indentured servitude; and WHEREAS, this economic concentration is driving the environmental devastation caused by factory farms; and WHEREAS, the effort by Smithfield Foods and by Tyson Foods to acquire hog and beef packer IAP threatens the existence of any semblance of a free market in those industries: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the House of Representatives of the Seventy- sixth Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the Senate concurring therein, that Congress be urged to enact federal legislation to halt for a period of at least twenty-four months all mergers and acquisitions between agribusiness of at least one hundred million in annual sales. This legislation would specifically include meat packers and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the attorney general of South Dakota be urged to take aggressive action against currently proposed and yet-to-be announced mergers and acquisitions that would cause further market concentration and price discrimination against family farm agricultural producers. In particular, the attorney general be urged to act now to stop the proposed buyout of hog and beef packer IBP by either Smithfield Food or Tyson Foods; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the federal Department of Justice (DOJ) be urged to reject the buyout of IBP by either Smithfield or Tyson."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 16378, "action_date": "2001-02-14T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 90069, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/90069.pdf", "status_text": "Motion to Amend,", "journal_page": 489, "committee_id_action": 712, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 16378, "action_date": "2001-02-14T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 90069, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/90069.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass Amended,", "journal_page": 489, "committee_id_action": 712, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "F", "vote": {"vote_id": 51522, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [2514, 2515, 2519, 2522, 2525, 2526, 2528, 2538, 2544, 2546, 2553, 2556, 2557, 2558, 2559, 2561, 2563, 2564, 2565, 2570, 2571, 2572, 2577, 2578, 2579, 2582, 2583, 2586, 2588, 2591, 2592, 2593, 2596, 2600, 2601, 2603, 2604, 2605, 2608, 2610, 2612, 2613, 2618, 2540], "Yea": [2518, 2521, 2527, 2530, 2541, 2543, 2545, 2547, 2548, 2554, 2555, 2560, 2566, 2568, 2574, 2575, 2587, 2589, 2594, 2599, 2602, 2611, 2614], "Excused": [2533, 2537, 2595]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/16378"}
