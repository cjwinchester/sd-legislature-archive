However, for the taxes payable in 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014, no nonagricultural or owner-occupied property's valuation may increase more than five percent per year because of such sales. The sales of nonagricultural and owner-occupied property may only be used in a sales ratio study as allowed by this section. Section 2. That section 1 of this Act and \u00a7 10-6-74 be repealed on November 1, 2012. Section 3. That chapter 10-6 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Notwithstanding the provisions of \u00a7 10-6-33, agricultural land shall be assessed based on its agricultural income value. The agricultural income value of agricultural land shall be determined on the basis of productivity and the annual earnings capacity of the agricultural land, if the land is used for agricultural purposes. The productivity of agricultural land and its annual earning capacity shall be based on data collected and analyzed pursuant to sections 4 to 7, inclusive, of this Act. However, for the taxes payable in 2010, 2011, and 2012, the total value of agricultural land within any county may not increase more than fifteen percent in any year. Section 4. That chapter 10-6 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Agricultural income value is defined as the capitalized average annual earning capacity. The capacity of cropland to produce agricultural products shall be based on average yields for crops or plants under natural conditions.

For the purpose of this section, annual earning capacity for: (1) Cropland is twenty-five percent of the annual gross income produced; and (2) Noncropland is twenty-five percent of the annual gross income capacity of the land based upon the animal-carrying capacity of the land. The economics department of South Dakota State University shall annually compute the average annual earning capacity of cropland and noncropland for each county using the database defined in section 6 of this Act. Any agricultural land receiving income from the conservation reserve program or other government program that makes annual payments shall be treated as cropland income unless it is clearly identified as a noncropland payment, until the contract payment has ended. After the contract payment ends, the land shall be assessed and taxed based on its use. The average annual earning capacity shall be capitalized at a rate of six percent to determine the capitalized average annual earning capacity.

The value for each soil type shall be determined from sales of similar land based upon its soil survey classification, and as adjusted for the factors contained in subdivision 10-6-33.1(2). The sales used shall be sales of agricultural land that are sold for agricultural purposes. Section 15. That \u00a7 10-6-31.3 be amended to read as follows: 10-6-31.3. For tax purposes, land is agricultural land if it meets two of the following three criteria: (1) At least thirty-three and one-third percent of the total family gross income of the owner is derived from the pursuit of agriculture as defined in subdivision (2) of this section or it is a state-owned public shooting area or a state-owned game production area as identified in \u00a7 41-4-8 and it is owned and managed by the Department of Game, Fish and Parks; (2) Its principal use is devoted to the raising and harvesting of crops or timber or fruit trees, the rearing, feeding, and management of farm livestock, poultry, fish, or nursery stock, the production of bees and apiary products, or horticulture, all for intended profit pursuant to subdivision (1) of this section. Agricultural real estate also includes woodland, wasteland, and pasture land, but only if the land is held and operated in conjunction with agricultural real estate as defined and it is under the same ownership; (3) It consists of not less than twenty acres of unplatted land or is a part of a contiguous ownership of not less than eighty acres of unplatted land. The same acreage specifications apply to platted land, excluding land platted as a subdivision, which is in an unincorporated area. However, the board of county commissioners may increase the minimum acre requirement up to one hundred sixty acres. However, for tax purposes, land is not agricultural land if the land is classified pursuant to \u00a7 10-6-33.14 as a nonagricultural acreage. Section 16. That \u00a7 10-13-37.1 be amended to read as follows: 10-13-37.1.

The factor shall be calculated by using the sales of arms-length transactions and the assessments from the preceding assessment year. The secretary shall take into consideration any reappraisals completed by the director of equalization. If there are less than fifteen sales of either class, the secretary shall use the preceding year's sales of that class with current assessments. In the case of agricultural land, sales may also be bridged in from adjoining counties if there are less than fifteen sales. Section 17. That \u00a7 13-11-10 be amended to read as follows: 13-11-10. In implementing the terms of \u00a7 13-11-9, a separate weighted average tax levy of the receiving districts shall be calculated for agricultural property, nonagricultural acreage property, owner-occupied single-family dwelling property, and for nonagricultural property for each sending school district as follows: (1) The levy per thousand dollars of taxable valuation for agricultural property for each receiving school district shall be multiplied by the number of children from the sending school district to whom the receiving school district is providing educational services; (2) Add together the products from subdivision (1) for each receiving school district; (3) Divide the sum from subdivision (2) by the total number of students that the contracting school district is sending to the receiving school districts pursuant to \u00a7 13-15-1.3. The quotient is the weighted average tax levy per one thousand dollars of taxable valuation for agricultural property; (4) The weighted average tax levy per thousand dollars of taxable valuation for nonagricultural acreage, owner-occupied single-family dwellings , and nonagricultural property shall be obtained by repeating the procedure outlined in subdivisions (1) to (3), inclusive, for each class of property; and (5) The sum of the levies assessed for all funds in the sending district shall be equal to or greater than the sum of all levies for all funds in the receiving district.

If the district's levies are less than the maximum levies as stated in this section, the levies shall maintain the same proportion to each other as represented in the mathematical relationship at the maximum levies; and (3) The maximum tax levy for an owner-occupied single-family dwelling as defined in \u00a7 10-13-40, for such school district may not exceed four dollars and twenty-six cents per thousand dollars of taxable valuation. If the district's levies are less than the maximum levies as stated in this section, the levies shall maintain the same proportion to each other as represented in the mathematical relationship at the maximum levies ; and (4) The maximum tax levy on nonagricultural acreage property as defined in \u00a7 10-6- 33.14, for such school district shall be three dollars and seventy-one cents per thousand dollars of taxable valuation. If the district's levies are less than the maximum levies as stated in this section, the levies shall maintain the same proportion to each other as represented in the mathematical relationship at the maximum levies . All levies in this section shall be imposed on valuations where the median level of assessment represents eighty-five percent of market value as determined by the Department of Revenue and Regulation. These valuations shall be used for all school funding purposes. If the district has imposed an excess levy pursuant to \u00a7 10-12-43, the levies shall maintain the same proportion to each other as represented in the mathematical relationship at the maximum levies in this section. The school district may elect to tax at less than the maximum amounts set forth in this section. Section 19.

If the district's levies are less than the maximum levies as stated in this section, the levies shall maintain the same proportion to each other as represented in the mathematical relationship at the maximum levies ; and (4) The maximum tax levy on nonagricultural acreage property as defined in \u00a7 10-6- 33.14, for such school district shall be three dollars and seventy-one cents per thousand dollars of taxable valuation. If the district's levies are less than the maximum levies as stated in this section, the levies shall maintain the same proportion to each other as represented in the mathematical relationship at the maximum levies . All levies in this section shall be imposed on valuations where the median level of assessment represents eighty-five percent of market value as determined by the Department of Revenue and Regulation. These valuations shall be used for all school funding purposes. If the district has imposed an excess levy pursuant to \u00a7 10-12-43, the levies shall maintain the same proportion to each other as represented in the mathematical relationship at the maximum levies in this section.

The agricultural income value of cropland shall be based on average rents over a three-year period for cropland under natural conditions. The agricultural income value of noncropland shall be based on average rents over a three-year period for noncropland under natural conditions. However, no arms-length rental agreements for irrigated land may be used to determine the annual cash rent pursuant to this section. The annual cash rent shall be capitalized at seven and three-fourths six and fifteen hundredths percent. The secretary of revenue and regulation may enter into a contract for the collection of cash rent information by county. Cash rent information shall be adjusted by soil survey statistics, if available, and pursuant to \u00a7 10-6-33.26. Section 23.
