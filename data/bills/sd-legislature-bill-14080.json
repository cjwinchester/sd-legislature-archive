WHEREAS, the benefits of agricultural land include food and fiber production, wildlife habitat, scenic vistas, psychological well-being of citizens, and enhanced economic and environmental benefits; and WHEREAS, South Dakota agriculture is a fifteen billion dollar industry, accounting for approximately forty-two percent of the gross state product; and WHEREAS, agriculture and its related industries provide challenging and fulfilling career opportunities; and WHEREAS, United States food and agriculture producer and processor exports amount to approximately seventy billion dollars a year, thereby creating a positive trade balance of twenty billion dollars a year; and WHEREAS, total agricultural production has more than doubled since 1930 even though the agricultural resource base has not changed substantially; and WHEREAS, the United States has less than seven percent of the world's land, but produces thirteen percent of the world's farm commodities; and WHEREAS, the average South Dakota farm family produces enough food to feed one hundred twenty-nine other people; and WHEREAS, the average South Dakota family of four consumes approximately two and one- half tons of food each year; and WHEREAS, because of the South Dakota farmers' productivity, South Dakota families buy their food for eleven and four-tenths percent of their disposable income today compared to sixteen and three-tenths percent spent by European families; and WHEREAS, since the average age of South Dakota farmers is sixty-one, it is critical that young people consider agriculture and related careers so the state's agricultural industry is not lost; and WHEREAS, although marketing of South Dakota crops and livestock in 1997 produced a twenty percent increase in cash receipts over 1993, production expenses contributed to a decline in actual farm income; and WHEREAS, farmers and ranchers are great conservationists of soil, water, and other natural resources, and are excellent stewards of wildlife habitat; and WHEREAS, it is farmers and ranchers - those who work the land and raise the animals - who help sustain life, who bring the greatest convenience to modern life, and truly understand the price of that convenience; and WHEREAS, as agriculture grows and prospers, so do our communities which provide significant resources for the agricultural industry; and WHEREAS, communities can work together to make agriculture economically sustainable and our communities viable; and WHEREAS, it is fitting that, as we honor South Dakota's rich cultural heritage, we continue the celebration by recognizing one of the most important parts of the state's history - the work of all agriculturalists: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the House of Representatives of the Seventy- fourth Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the Senate concurring therein, that 1999 be declared the Year of Agriculture in South Dakota; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Legislature urges the citizens of South Dakota to reflect on the contributions made by the farmers who work the soil, ranchers and farmers who raise the animals, and business persons who sustain the effort to produce the food and fiber that enriches lives, and encourage South Dakotans to support the state's agricultural producers and processors."}, {"bill_id": 14080, "bill_version_id": 81293, "bill_version": "Enrolled", "bill_version_date": "1999-02-08T00:00:00-06:00", "bill_text": "January 19, 1999 February 4, 1999"}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 14080, "action_date": "1999-01-19T09:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 81862, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/81862.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 614, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 14080, "action_date": "1999-01-19T09:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 81862, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/81862.pdf", "status_text": "Adopt Resolution", "journal_page": 79, "committee_id_action": 614, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 42041, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [2204, 2211, 2213, 2222, 2236, 2248, 2249, 2260, 2261, 2284, 2286, 2297], "Excused": [2298]}}, {"bill_id": 14080, "action_date": "1999-01-20T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 82116, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/82116.pdf", "status_text": "Adopt Resolution", "journal_page": 93, "committee_id_action": 628, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 43184, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [2200, 2203, 2204, 2207, 2208, 2209, 2210, 2211, 2212, 2213, 2214, 2216, 2218, 2219, 2220, 2222, 2223, 2227, 2228, 2229, 2231, 2232, 2233, 2236, 2237, 2238, 2240, 2243, 2244, 2247, 2248, 2249, 2250, 2253, 2254, 2255, 2256, 2257, 2260, 2261, 2262, 2264, 2265, 2266, 2267, 2268, 2271, 2272, 2273, 2276, 2277, 2278, 2281, 2282, 2284, 2286, 2287, 2288, 2290, 2291, 2295, 2296, 2297, 2298, 2300, 2301, 2302, 2303, 2245], "Excused": [2279]}}, {"bill_id": 14080, "action_date": "1999-01-26T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 81996, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/81996.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 602, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 14080, "action_date": "1999-02-04T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 81999, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/81999.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 602, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 14080, "action_date": "1999-02-04T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 81999, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/81999.pdf", "status_text": "Concur In resolution", "journal_page": 331, "committee_id_action": 602, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 43120, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [2205, 2242, 2252, 2280, 2292, 2294, 2224], "Excused": [2206, 2241]}}, {"bill_id": 14080, "action_date": "1999-02-05T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 81774, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/81774.pdf", "status_text": "Concur In resolution", "journal_page": 351, "committee_id_action": 629, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 40988, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [2199, 2201, 2202, 2205, 2206, 2215, 2217, 2221, 2224, 2225, 2226, 2230, 2234, 2239, 2242, 2246, 2251, 2252, 2258, 2259, 2269, 2270, 2274, 2275, 2280, 2283, 2285, 2289, 2292, 2293, 2294], "Excused": [2235, 2241, 2263, 2299]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/14080"}
