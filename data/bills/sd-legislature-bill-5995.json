WHEREAS, the South Dakota cattle industry is vital to the economic and social well-being of the state; and WHEREAS, foot-and-mouth disease is one of the most contagious diseases known to cloven-footed animals including cattle, hogs, and sheep and an outbreak of the disease could significantly harm livestock producers and South Dakota's economy; and WHEREAS, the United States has not had an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease since 1929 when the disease was then inadvertently introduced into the state of California via contaminated animal products imported from Argentina; and WHEREAS, the United States has successfully prevented any further reintroductions of foot-and-mouth disease by strictly prohibiting the importation of livestock and fresh and chilled meat originating in countries where foot-and-mouth disease has not been eradicated and where a risk of outbreaks persists; and WHEREAS, the United States Department of Agriculture is now proposing a rule to allow the importation into the United States of fresh and chilled beef from fourteen states in Brazil, including states where widespread outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease occurred as recently as 2005 and 2006, where vaccination is practiced in an attempt to control foot-and-mouth disease, and that are adjacent to Paraguay, which had an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease as recently as 2011; and WHEREAS, the United States Department of Agriculture admits there is an increased risk of introducing foot-and-mouth disease into the United States under its proposed rule by acknowledging that \"as long as foot-and-mouth disease is endemic in the overall region in South America, there is a risk of reintroduction from adjacent areas into the proposed exporting region,\" which is the fourteen states in Brazil; and WHEREAS, the United States Department of Agriculture further admits that its proposed rule would result in reduced financial returns to cattle producers and beef processors in the United States, which necessarily includes those in the State of South Dakota: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the House of Representatives of the Eighty-Ninth Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the Senate concurring therein, that the United States Department of Agriculture be requested to immediately withdraw its proposed rule titled \"Importation of Beef from a Region in Brazil\" that would allow the importation of fresh and chilled beef from fourteen states in Brazil and instead to promulgate a rule to strictly prohibit the importation of fresh and chilled beef from Brazil until the United States Secretary of Agriculture certifies to Congress that every region of Brazil is free of foot-and-mouth disease without vaccination; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a copy of this resolution be sent to the President of the United States, the United States Secretary of Agriculture, and each member of the South Dakota congressional delegation."}, {"bill_id": 5995, "bill_version_id": 31626, "bill_version": "Enrolled", "bill_version_date": "2014-03-06T08:30:11.437-06:00", "bill_text": ""}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 5995, "action_date": "2014-02-21T12:30:00-06:00", "document_id": 30823, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/30823.pdf", "status_text": "First Reading", "journal_page": 488, "committee_id_action": 231, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 5995, "action_date": "2014-02-24T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 30936, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/30936.pdf", "status_text": "Adopt Resolution", "journal_page": 499, "committee_id_action": 231, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 16503, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [528, 527, 453, 522, 525, 433, 467, 524, 456, 489, 517, 519, 505, 449, 431, 455, 425, 504, 481, 503, 477, 501, 520, 479, 457, 454, 523, 496, 458, 451, 466, 845, 499, 442, 476, 521, 507, 478, 487, 423, 439, 500, 502, 497, 515, 511, 512, 463, 518, 484, 462, 485, 514, 459, 464, 510, 450, 506, 430, 513, 468, 498, 461, 516, 508, 480, 460, 448, 441], "Nay": [509]}}, {"bill_id": 5995, "action_date": "2014-02-25T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 31062, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/31062.pdf", "status_text": "First read and referred to", "journal_page": 451, "committee_id_action": 229, "committee_id_assigned": 205, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 5995, "action_date": "2014-03-04T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 31187, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/31187.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 205, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 5995, "action_date": "2014-03-04T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 31442, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/31442.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass", "journal_page": 529, "committee_id_action": 205, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 16885, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [495, 447, 436, 492, 491, 440, 434, 475, 429]}}, {"bill_id": 5995, "action_date": "2014-03-05T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 31597, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/31597.pdf", "status_text": "Concurred in Resolution", "journal_page": 551, "committee_id_action": 229, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 16995, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [469, 437, 444, 473, 846, 495, 447, 472, 470, 432, 465, 847, 483, 443, 429, 452, 436, 438, 526, 424, 492, 491, 428, 475, 435, 440, 493, 849, 474, 426, 446, 494, 434, 490, 486]}}]}
