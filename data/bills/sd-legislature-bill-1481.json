WHEREAS, Congress passed the Wilderness Act of 1964 \"to establish a National Wilderness Preservation System for the permanent good of the whole people, and for other purposes\"; and WHEREAS, under the Wilderness Act of 1964 and subsequent federal legislation, many areas across the nation have been designated as \"wilderness areas\" or \"roadless areas\"; and WHEREAS, the effect of the designation of wilderness or roadless areas in many cases is to hinder or preclude the ability of South Dakota citizens to develop and use the natural resources of this state in a fair and equitable manner; and WHEREAS, many of our rural economies depend on a combination of multiple uses of our public lands, such as agriculture, grazing, timber production, and mineral development, as well as motorized and mechanized recreation, all of which may be prohibited or seriously inhibited by a wilderness or roadless designation; and WHEREAS, wilderness and roadless designations may limit the land management options available to public land managers to protect forest health and dependent watersheds and other public lands; and WHEREAS, land and resource conservation decisions must consider the relationship between the land and the local economy, because many jobs are tied to activities on public lands such as mining, agriculture, and tourism; and WHEREAS, programs for the designation of wilderness or roadless areas in South Dakota must be based upon the principles of balance, stewardship, and collaboration of all affected parties; and WHEREAS, the South Dakota Legislature finds that a regional strategy involving all affected parties is the preferred approach to the designation of wilderness and roadless areas: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the House of Representatives of the Eighty-fifth Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the Senate concurring therein, that the South Dakota Legislature requests the United States Department of the Interior, the United States Department of Agriculture, the Bureau of Land Management, the United States Forest Service, and other federal natural resource and land management agencies to structure their policies so that no area in South Dakota may be designated as a wilderness or roadless area unless the designation has been approved by a two-thirds majority in each house of the South Dakota Legislature."}, {"bill_id": 1481, "bill_version_id": 10861, "bill_version": "Enrolled", "bill_version_date": "2010-01-22T08:37:35.683-06:00", "bill_text": ""}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 1481, "action_date": "2010-01-14T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 10501, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/10501.pdf", "status_text": "First Reading", "journal_page": 43, "committee_id_action": 86, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 1481, "action_date": "2010-01-15T12:30:00-06:00", "document_id": 10551, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/10551.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to another day", "journal_page": 53, "committee_id_action": 86, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 1481, "action_date": "2010-01-19T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 10645, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/10645.pdf", "status_text": "Adopt Resolution", "journal_page": 107, "committee_id_action": 86, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 5525, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [821, 781, 740, 756, 817, 814, 765, 830, 832, 826, 835, 834, 822, 816, 788, 836, 818, 763, 823], "Yea": [825, 771, 793, 775, 844, 831, 804, 779, 748, 811, 798, 749, 829, 757, 842, 777, 803, 843, 824, 800, 801, 827, 750, 742, 770, 792, 783, 755, 751, 773, 744, 840, 784, 839, 819, 841, 815, 833, 762, 746, 752, 796, 828, 789, 838, 837, 812, 786], "Excused": [820, 813, 759]}}, {"bill_id": 1481, "action_date": "2010-01-20T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 10734, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/10734.pdf", "status_text": "First Reading", "journal_page": 90, "committee_id_action": 84, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 1481, "action_date": "2010-01-21T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 10825, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/10825.pdf", "status_text": "Concurred in Resolution", "journal_page": 104, "committee_id_action": 84, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 5623, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [758, 809, 787, 790, 807, 754, 805, 760, 778, 782, 780, 739, 802, 795, 741, 772, 766, 791, 806, 808, 769, 743, 753, 745, 794, 799, 810, 776], "Nay": [785, 764, 761, 774, 767, 747], "Excused": [768]}}]}
