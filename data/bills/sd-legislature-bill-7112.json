The conservator and custodian provisions of subdivision 3-12-95(2) and \u00a7 3-12-95.1 notwithstanding, the benefit becomes payable directly to a child when the child reaches eighteen years of age. The benefit shall be eliminated when the child becomes ineligible pursuant to subdivision 3-12-47(14). Section 20. That \u00a7 3-12-95.3 be amended to read: 3-12-95.3. That The portion of a family benefit that is payable on account of children pursuant to subdivision 3-12-95(1) shall be eliminated as each child becomes ineligible pursuant to subdivision 3-12-47(14).

In order to be eligible for a disability benefit, a member must be disabled on the date the member's contributory service ends. Any member who fails to file an application for disability benefits with the administrator executive director within three years of after the date on which the member's contributory service ends, forfeits all rights to disability benefits. Any information required for a complete application must be received within one year after the application for disability benefits was received. If the required information is not received by the system within one year after the application is received, the member may reapply. For purposes of this section, a transfer within a participating unit, or a change in employment from one participating unit to another participating unit if there is no break in contributory service, does not constitute a new entry into active status. The provisions of this section apply to any member whose application for disability benefits is received by the system prior to before July 1, 2015. Section 22. That \u00a7 3-12-99.1 be amended to read: 3-12-99.1.

The provisions of this section apply to any member whose application for disability benefits is received by the system prior to before July 1, 2015. Section 23. That \u00a7 3-12-114 be amended to read: 3-12-114. If any change or error in the records of the system or any participating unit results in any person receiving from the system less than the person would have been entitled to receive had the records been correct, the administrator executive director shall correct the error and, as far as practicable, shall adjust the payment to provide the person the amount to which the person is correctly entitled. If any change or error in the records of the system or any participating unit results in any person receiving from the system more than the person would have been entitled to receive had the records been correct, the administrator executive director shall correct the error and, as far as practicable, shall recover the overpayment to reflect the amount to which the person is correctly entitled. The board shall promulgate rules, pursuant to chapter 1-26, concerning the methods by which an overpayment shall be repaid, including an actuarial equivalent. However, the recovery of an overpayment is limited to the amount attributable to any error that occurred during the six-year period immediately prior to before the discovery of the error.

If there is no surviving spouse, the payment shall be payable to all of the member's surviving children, irrespective of age, on a share-alike basis. If there is no surviving spouse and there are no surviving children, the payment shall be payable to the estate of the deceased member. If no claim for payment due upon the death of a deceased member is made within three years from date of death, the payment shall revert to the system. However, a claim may be honored after the expiration of the three-year reversion period if, in the opinion of the administrator executive director, payment of the claim is warranted by exceptional circumstances. Section 25. That \u00a7 3-12-118 be amended to read: 3-12-118. The Board of Trustees board shall retain the services of an independent contractor, not involved in the investment process, to make a report to the board not less than every four years on the investment performance results of the assets of the retirement funds. The report shall include, but not be limited to, the investment for the total portfolio and each major investment category thereof; a comparison of the investment return on the common stocks in the portfolio to market indices in general use and to the results achieved by other institutional investors of pension funds; and an appraisal of the success of the management of the actively traded bond portfolio, including a comparison of the return on the bonds in the portfolio to the bond indices in general use and a quantitative estimate of the aggregate gains or losses arising out of the portfolio transactions, both current exchanges and those that have to be worked out over time by a series of trades.

If any of the conditions set out in this section exist for a period of three consecutive annual actuarial valuations, the board shall recommend benefit reductions changes, contribution changes, or any other corrective action, or any combination of actions, for approval by the Legislature and the Governor, effective as soon as possible, to improve the conditions set out in this section. Eligibility for benefits, the amount of any benefit, and the rate of member contributions established in this chapter are not the contractual rights of any member and are subject to change by the Legislature for purposes of corrective action to improve the conditions established in this section. Section 27. That \u00a7 3-12-127 be amended to read: 3-12-127. Notwithstanding the repeal on July 1, 1974, of chapters 3-12; 3-13; 9-15; 13-45; certain provisions of chapter 16-8; chapter 16-11A; and certain provisions of chapter 33-13, all members of systems established thereunder shall be entitled to retire at the age, with the length of service and the benefits available to them under those provisions or the provisions of this chapter.

The provisions of this section also apply to a current contributing Class B member, other than a justice, judge, or magistrate judge, who previously has purchased equivalent public service pursuant to the provisions of \u00a7 3-12-84.

The administrator executive director shall solicit r\u00e9sum\u00e9s of qualified individuals persons from governing bodies and interested individuals persons.

The provisions of a qualified domestic relations order shall be prospective from the date of the order. Any division of benefits paid prior to the date of the order, service of the order upon the system, or qualification of the order by the system, whichever is later, shall be the responsibility of the parties to the order.

If the member does not have a spouse, the reduction shall continue for the member's lifetime. If the member has a spouse, the reduction shall reduce both the member's monthly benefits and the surviving spouse's monthly benefits and shall continue for both the member's and the surviving spouse's lifetimes. In the alternative, a member who must required to repay an overpayment of benefits pursuant to SDCL 3-12-114 may choose to make immediate repayment in a lump-sum from other funds or may choose to make repayment by monthly benefit reductions over a period not to exceed three years. Repayment shall include interest at the assumed rate of return as defined in SDCL subdivision 3-12-47(9A), unless the overpayment is due to a system error, in which case the administrator executive director may absolve any interest accrual. If a member's repayment is delayed for more than three months, interest on the overpayment amount shall accrue during the period of delay at the system's assumed rate of return, unless the overpayment is due to a system error, in which case the administrator executive director may absolve any interest accrual. If a member who must required to repay an overpayment does not choose a repayment option within two months after being given notice of the overpayment, the member is deemed to have chosen to make repayment by an actuarial equivalent reduction in monthly benefits as outlined in this section. If repayment is pursuant to an actuarial equivalent reduction by either the member's choice or the member's failure to choose a repayment option, system staff shall inform the member that the reduction is unlikely to result in repayment of the exact amount of the overpayment, plus interest if appropriate, and the member is presumed to so understand. Section 87. That ARSD 62:01:07:13 be amended to read: 62:01:07:13...Administration of additional survivor protection contributions and coverage.

That ARSD 62:03:02:04 be amended to read: 62:03:02:04...Participation agreement. The administrator executive director shall establish a form of participation agreement which includes the name, address, social security number, and birthdate of the participant and the participant's beneficiary; the name and address of the participant's employer; the participant's selection of investment alternatives; and any other information necessary for the administration of the plan. Section 91. That ARSD 62:03:05:06 be amended to read: 62:03:05:06...Unforeseeable emergency. If a participant suffers an unforeseeable emergency, the participant may request an immediate distribution of all or part of the participant's deferrals. If the administrator executive director approves the request, the distribution shall be made to the extent necessary to satisfy the need, including payment of federal income tax withholding, if necessary. If the administrator executive director denies the request, the participant may appeal the denial pursuant to the appeal procedures outlined in SDCL 3-12-57.1 and in ARSD chapter 62:01:06 by giving notice of intention to appeal within 30 days after the date of the administrator's executive director's written notice of denial. The appeal shall be conducted in accordance with SDCL chapter 1-26. No distribution may be made to the extent that the unforeseeable emergency may be relieved through reimbursement or compensation by insurance or otherwise, by liquidation of the participant's assets to the extent that the liquidation does not cause severe financial hardship, or by discontinuation of deferrals under the plan. The need to send a participant's child to college, divorce proceedings, or the desire to purchase a home are not considered unforeseeable emergencies. Any amount that is distributed on account of an unforeseeable emergency is not an eligible rollover distribution and the participant may not elect to have any portion of the distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan. The provisions of this section do not apply if a distribution may be made pursuant to \u00a7.62:03:05:07. Section 92. That ARSD 62:03:05:07 be amended to read: 62:03:05:07...In-service distributions of small amounts _ Calculation _ Handling of certain involuntary distributions.

If implementing subdivision (2) of this section, the value of a participant's nonforfeitable account balance shall be determined without regard to that portion of the account balance that is attributable to rollover contributions (, and earning allocable thereto), within the meaning of \u00a7\u00a7.402(c), 403(a)(4), 403(b)(8), 408(d)(3)(A)(ii), and 457(e) of the code Internal Revenue Code. If an involuntary distribution is in excess of $1,000 and if the participant does not elect to have the distribution transferred to an eligible retirement plan pursuant to \u00a7.401(a)(31) of the code Internal Revenue Code or does not elect to receive the distribution directly, the distribution shall be transferred to an individual retirement plan of a designated trustee or issuer. The plan administrator executive director shall notify the participant in writing that the distribution may be transferred to another individual retirement plan."}, {"bill_id": 7112,
