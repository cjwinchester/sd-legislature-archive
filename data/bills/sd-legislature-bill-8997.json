WHEREAS, the constitution of the Oglala Sioux Tribe authorizes the tribal council to negotiate with federal, state, and local governmental officials on behalf of the Oglala Sioux Tribe; and WHEREAS, the Oglala Sioux Tribe education committee has been delegated oversight of tribal schools and the education of tribal youth; and WHEREAS, the committee met on December 18, 2017, to take action to file a petition for redress of grievances with the South Dakota State Senate and House of Representatives, regarding the facilitation of the mismanagement and misappropriation of tens of millions of dollars of grant funds intended for Native American youth in the GEAR UP Program, and other federal grant programs, administered by the South Dakota Department of Education, by current and former state officials; and WHEREAS, the First Amendment of the United States Constitution, Article VI \u00a7 4 of the South Dakota Constitution, and Mason's Manual of Legislative Procedure, guarantees South Dakotans a right to petition state government for the redress of grievances; and WHEREAS, on January 11, 2018, the Oglala Sioux Tribal Council formally and officially delivered their grievance resolution which was accepted by the State-Tribal Relations Committee in the South Dakota Capitol; and WHEREAS, the Oglala Sioux Tribe respectfully grieves that former South Dakota Secretary of Education Melody Schopp, former South Dakota Secretary of Education Tom Oster, former Secretary of Education Rick Melmer, former Meade County Superintendent Don Kirkegaard, former Indian Education Director for South Dakota's Department of Education Keith Moore, Northern State Dean of Education Kelly Duncan, Department of Education Finance and Management Director Tamara Darnall, and former GEAR UP Evaluator Brinda Kuhn allowed or facilitated themselves to inappropriately financially benefit, at the expense of South Dakota Native American youth, through unethical contracts, mismanagement, and misappropriation of funds of the GEAR UP Program and other federal grants programs; and WHEREAS, serious metrics or monitoring of factual measurable goals and objectives were never implemented for the proper oversight of South Dakota's GEAR UP Program; and WHEREAS, explicit written warnings by former directors of Indian Education LuAnn Werdell and Roger Campbell of mismanagement and misappropriations in the federal grants administered by the South Dakota Department of Education, were effectively ignored and they were retaliated against for their efforts; and WHEREAS, the catastrophic human and financial costs associated with the unethical conflicts of interests of numerous current and former state officials personally benefitting from their improper financial grant programs, deprived South Dakota's Native American youth and their communities of an estimated one hundred million dollars which will have lasting negative effects on South Dakota Native American youth and their families for generations to come; and WHEREAS, despite the statutory and moral obligation to do so, the Government Operations and Audit Committee and the State-Tribal Relations Committee, refused to fully examine, address, or correct these egregious violations of the public's trust that were facilitated by state officials for over a decade; and WHEREAS, this dereliction of legislative oversight imparts a tacit message to those responsible for the GEAR UP corruption, that effectively condones it, and assists in covering up their unscrupulous behavior while reopening centuries old wounds caused by previous unethical practices of government officials improperly benefitting at the expense of Native Americans; and WHEREAS, the South Dakota state government has experienced a serious loss of confidence from South Dakotans across the state due to the GEAR UP corruption scandal and has received failing grades from national groups concerning South Dakota state government's susceptibility to corruption, cronyism, and nepotism; and WHEREAS, the State-Tribal Relations Committee is required by law via \u00a7 2-6-23 \"..to draw upon public input from all those who may be concerned and knowledgeable about state-tribal relations whether Indian or non-Indian, whether tribal members or nontribal members.\" And make legislative recommendations to facilitate its mission;

and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Legislature recommends indefinite suspension of all state employment and involvement in state-administered grant programs by those current and past state officials cited in this resolution, pending determination of their involvement and complicity. Conclusive determination contingent upon the explicit exoneration by an independent and thorough investigation into the mismanagement and misappropriations of grant moneys intended for Native South Dakota youth from 2005 to 2017; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Legislature requests the United States Attorney appoint a special prosecutor to investigate and prosecute, both civilly and criminally, all current and former state officials who facilitated the mismanagement, misappropriation, or unethically benefitted from federal grant moneys meant for Native American youth; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Legislature devise scholarships for eligible Native American high school students to repay the estimated one hundred million dollars lost to past Native American students. Funding for the scholarships to come from deductions from the Department of Education's budget for the next twelve years, and civil recoupments from those responsible or negligent in the mismanagement of the affected grants."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 8997, "action_date": "2018-01-19T12:30:00-06:00", "document_id": 47398, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/47398.pdf", "status_text": "First read and referred to", "journal_page": 153, "committee_id_action": 395, "committee_id_assigned": 376, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 8997, "action_date": "2018-02-21T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 49211, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/49211.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 376, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 8997, "action_date": "2018-02-21T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 49624, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/49624.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to the 41st legislative day", "journal_page": 544, "committee_id_action": 376, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 26160, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [1230, 1217, 1262, 1270, 1224, 1218, 1239, 1246], "Nay": [1237]}}]}
