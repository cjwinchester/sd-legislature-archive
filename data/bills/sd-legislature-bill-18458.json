BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. The director of equalization shall assess all property subject to the acquisition method of valuation. The base year value for the property is the market value as assessed on November 1, 2004, or if the property changes ownership after November 1, 2004, the sale price of the property. The sale price of the property shall be used to determine the assessed value if the sale was an arms-length transaction. The assessed value may be adjusted to reflect any change in use or classification plus the value of any addition, improvement, or destruction to the property after November 1, 2004, or the date thereafter that the property changes ownership. Section 2. If a sale is determined to be other than an arms-length transaction, the director of equalization shall appraise the property at market value as of the date of the sale and the value established by the director of equalization becomes the base year value for the purpose of taxation. Section 3. The value of property shall be adjusted to reflect any change in use or classification plus the value of any addition, improvement, or destruction other than by natural disaster that has occurred since November 1, 2004, or since the time the property has been acquired. Section 4. All property is reassessed as of November first of each year by adjusting the base year value of the preceding year by the lesser of three percent or the annual percentage change in the consumer price index for urban wage earners and clerical workers as computed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, United States Department of Labor for the year prior to the year immediately preceding the year in which the property is assessed. However, if the ownership of property changes before November first, the property shall be assessed at the sale price which the property changed ownership, if the change in ownership was an arms-length transaction. Section 5. The director of equalization shall adjust the property's base year value established pursuant to sections 1 to 4, inclusive, of this Act and as provided in S.D. Const., Art. XI, \u00a7 2. The adjustment in the base year value pursuant to this Act shall apply for tax purposes beginning on November first if the change in the value occurred before November first. Section 6. The assessed value of property may not exceed the market value of the property. If the assessed value exceeds the market value of the property, the assessed value shall be reduced to the market value. Section 7. New property shall be assessed at market value as of November first of year following classification of the property. After the property is classified and assessed, the value of the property shall be adjusted as provided in section 4 of this Act. Section 8. If there is a change in use or classification or an addition, improvement, or destruction to the property, the change in use or classification or the addition, improvement, or destruction shall be assessed at market value as of November first after the change in use or classification has occurred or the addition, improvement, or destruction is substantially completed. Section 9. A change, addition, or improvement does not include the replacement of a portion of property damaged or destroyed due to misfortune or calamity, if the market value of the damaged or destroyed portion as replaced is not more than one hundred twenty-five percent of the market value of the damaged or destroyed portion of the property. The value of any replaced property that is in excess of one hundred twenty-five percent of the market value of the damaged or destroyed property is considered to be a change, addition, or improvement. The value of any replaced property with market value of less than one hundred percent of the original property shall be assessed pursuant to section 10 of this Act. Section 10. If property is destroyed or removed and not replaced, the assessed value of the property shall be reduced by the assessed value attributable to the destroyed or removed property. Section 11. The assessed value of the property shall be adjusted if any change, addition, or improvement is made by the owner or an owner association which directly benefits the property. Any such change, addition, or improvement shall be assessed at market value and that market value shall be apportioned among the parcels benefiting from the improvement. Section 12. If the classification of property is changed from one classification to another classification of property, the director of equalization shall appraise the property at market value as of the date of the reclassification and the value established by the director of equalization becomes the base year value for the purpose of taxation. Section 13. A change in ownership means any sale, foreclosure, or transfer of legal title or beneficial title in equity to any person, including: (1) For property owned by a partnership, any substantive change in the partnership agreement, including the addition or subtraction of partners or in the proportionate allocation of shares among the partners; (2) For property owned by a subchapter S corporation, any substantive change in the ownership of the corporation, including the addition or subtraction of owners or in the proportionate ownership of the corporation among the owners; or (3) For property owned by a corporation, the stock of which is publicly held or publicly traded, the point in time when more than fifty percent of the shares of the stock in the corporation have been traded, regardless of the identity of the buyer or seller of the stock. In establishing the basis upon which the fifty percent determination is made, the director of equalization shall ascertain the number of shares of stock in the corporation as reported in the most recent financial report of the corporation and number of shares ascertained by the director of equalization in this manner is twice the number of shares that shall be traded for a future acquisition revaluation to be required. Section 14. There is no change in ownership if: (1) Subsequent to the change or transfer, the same person is the owner and the transfer of title corrects an error or the transfer is between legal and equitable title; (2) Ownership transfers between husband and wife, including a transfer to a surviving spouse or transfer due to a dissolution of marriage, or upon the death of the owner; or (3) Ownership transfers between the owner and another for whom the property will qualify as owner-occupied single-family dwelling pursuant to \u00a7 10-13-39 within one year of the death of the owner, if the new owner was legally or naturally dependent upon the owner immediately prior to the deceased owner's death. Section 15. If any error is made in arriving at any annual assessment under this Act due to a material mistake of fact concerning an essential characteristic of the property, the assessment shall be recalculated for each year for which the error was made. Section 16. If changes, additions, or improvements are not assessed at market value as of November first after the changes, additions, or improvements were substantially completed, the director of equalization shall determine the market value for each year the changes, additions, or improvement were substantially completed. Each assessment for each subsequent year shall be corrected by applying section 4 of this Act, if applicable. If an assessment is revised, the corrections made pursuant to this section shall be used to recalculate the taxes due. Section 17. If a person not entitled to an assessment value under this Act inadvertently receives a lower assessment value, the person is not required to pay the unpaid taxes, penalties, or interest. The assessment shall be corrected as provided in section 16 of this Act. Section 18. That \u00a7 10-6-1 be amended to read as follows: 10-6-1.

Section 19. That \u00a7 10-6-33 be amended to read as follows: 10-6-33. All property shall be assessed at its true and full value in money. The true and full value is the taxable value of such property upon which the levy shall be made and applied and the taxes computed. In determining the true and full value of property the director of equalization may not adopt a lower or different standard of value because it is to serve as a basis of taxation. The director may not adopt as a criterion of value the price for which the property would sell at a forced sale, or in the aggregate with all the property in the third class municipality or district. The director shall value each article or description by itself and at an amount or price as he believes the property to be fairly worth in money its acquisition value . The true and full value shall be determined by appropriate consideration of the cost approach, the market approach , and the income approach to appraisal if there is a change in use or classification or to account for any addition, improvement, or destruction to the property other than by natural disaster .
