BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. A health benefit plan shall provide coverage for the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of autism spectrum disorder. To the extent that the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of autism spectrum disorder are not already covered by a health benefit plan, coverage pursuant to this Act must be included in health benefit plans that are delivered, executed, issued, amended, adjusted, or renewed in this state on or after July 1, 2014. Section 2. Coverage provided pursuant to this Act may not be subject to any limits on the number of visits an individual may make for treatment of autism spectrum disorder. Coverage under this Act may not be subject to dollar limits, deductibles, or coinsurance provisions that are less favorable to an insured than the dollar limits, deductibles, or coinsurance provisions that apply to substantially all medical and surgical benefits under the health insurance policy.

Section 6. Except for inpatient services, if an insured is receiving treatment for an autism spectrum disorder, an insurer has the right to review the treatment plan annually, unless the insurer and the insured's treating physician or psychologist agree that a more frequent review is necessary. Any such agreement regarding the right to review a treatment plan more frequently applies only to a particular insured being treated for an autism spectrum disorder and does not apply to all individuals being treated for autism spectrum disorder by a physician or psychologist.
