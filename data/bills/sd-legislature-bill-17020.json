Such exchanges may be conditional as long as the transfer is completed within two years and as long as the trust corpus is never diminished. Any cash received from such an exchange shall be treated as a cash sale pursuant to the provisions of chapter 5-9. The commissioner shall promulgate rules pursuant to chapter 1-26 to establish the procedures and criteria for such exchanges as provided in this chapter . Section 2.

That chapter 5-3 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: No tract of land may be exchanged under \u00a7 5-3-7 unless the commissioner of school and public lands has published notice that the land is being considered for exchange.
