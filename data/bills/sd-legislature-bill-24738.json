The instructions may permit the lead state director or commissioner to allow a controlling person that is not the ultimate controlling person to file the group capital calculation.

The director may promulgate rules pursuant to chapter 1-26 to establish requirements, standards, criteria, exemptions, instructions, and limitations for the group capital calculation and related filings. Section 8. That chapter 58-5A be amended with a NEW SECTION: Insurance holding company systems described in this section are exempt from filing the group capital calculation provided in section 7 of this Act: (1) An insurance holding company system that: (a) Has only one insurer within its holding company structure; (b) Only writes business in its domestic state; (c) Is only licensed in its domestic state; and (d) Assumes no business from any other insurer; (2) An insurance holding company system that is required to perform a group capital calculation specified by the United States Federal Reserve Board.

If the lead state director or commissioner determines that an insurance holding company system no longer meets one or more of the requirements for an exemption from filing the group capital calculation under this section, the insurance holding company system must file the group capital calculation at the next annual filing date unless given an extension by the lead state director or commissioner based on reasonable grounds shown. The lead state director or commissioner has the discretion to exempt the ultimate controlling person from filing the annual group capital calculation or to accept a limited group capital filing or report in accordance with criteria as specified by the director in rules promulgated pursuant to chapter 1-26. Section 9. That chapter 58-5A be amended with a NEW SECTION: Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivisions (3) and (4) of section 8 of this Act, if this state is considered the lead state, the director must require the filing of the group capital calculation for U.S. operations for any non-U.S. based insurance holding company system where, after any necessary consultation with other supervisors or officials, it is deemed appropriate by the director for prudential oversight and solvency monitoring purposes or for ensuring the competitiveness of the insurance marketplace. Section 10. That chapter 58-5A be amended with a NEW SECTION: The ultimate controlling person of every insurer subject to registration and scoped into the NAIC liquidity stress test framework must file the results of a specific year\u2019s liquidity stress test. The filing must be made to the lead state insurance director or commissioner of the insurance holding company system as determined by the procedures within the financial analysis handbook adopted by the director pursuant to rules promulgated under chapter 1-26. The NAIC liquidity stress test framework includes scope criteria applicable to a specific data year. The scope criteria are reviewed at least annually by the financial stability task force or its successor. Any change to the NAIC liquidity stress test framework or to the data year for which the scope criteria are to be measured is effective on January first of the year following the calendar year when such changes are adopted. Insurers meeting at least one threshold of the scope criteria are scoped into the NAIC liquidity stress test framework for the specified data year unless the lead state insurance director or commissioner, in consultation with insurance commissioners at the NAIC financial stability task force or its successor, determines the insurer may not be scoped into the framework for that data year. Insurers that do not trigger at least one threshold of the scope criteria are considered scoped out of the NAIC liquidity stress test framework for the specified data year, unless the lead state insurance director or commissioner, in consultation with the NAIC financial stability task force or its successor, determines the insurer should be scoped into the framework for that data year. The performance of, and filing of the results from, a specific year\u2019s liquidity stress test must comply with the NAIC liquidity stress test framework\u2019s instructions and reporting templates for that year and any lead state insurance director or commissioner determinations, in consultation with the NAIC financial stability task force or its successor, provided within the framework. The director may promulgate rules pursuant to chapter 1-26 to establish requirements, standards, criteria, exemptions, and limitations for the liquidity stress test and related filings. Section 11. That chapter 58-5A be amended with a NEW SECTION: The group capital calculation and resulting group capital ratio required under section 7 of this Act and the liquidity stress test, along with its results and supporting disclosures, required under section 10 of this Act, are regulatory tools for assessing group risks and capital adequacy and group liquidity risks and may not be used as a means to rank insurers or insurance holding company systems generally. Except as otherwise required under the provisions of this chapter, a licensee under this title is prohibited from releasing information with regard to the group capital calculation, group capital ratio, the liquidity stress test results, or supporting disclosures for the liquidity stress test of any insurer or any insurer group or of any component derived in the calculation by any insurer, broker, or other person engaged in any manner in the insurance business by making, publishing, disseminating, circulating, or placing before the public the information, or causing the information to be directly or indirectly made, published, disseminated, circulated, or placed before the public: (1) In a newspaper, magazine, or other publication; (2) In the form of a notice, circular, pamphlet, letter, or poster; (3) Over any radio or television station; (4) Any electronic means of communication available to the public; or (5) In any other way as an advertisement, announcement, or statement. Section 12. That chapter 58-5A be amended with a NEW SECTION: If information is released in contradiction of section 11 of this Act, an insurer may publish an announcement in a written publication if the sole purpose of the announcement is to rebut any materially false statement with respect to the group capital calculation or any resulting group capital ratio, an inappropriate comparison of any amount to an insurer\u2019s or insurance group\u2019s group capital calculation or resulting group capital ratio, liquidity stress test result, supporting disclosures for the liquidity stress test, or an inappropriate comparison of any amount to an insurer\u2019s or insurance group\u2019s liquidity stress test result or supporting disclosures is published in any written publication and the insurer is able to demonstrate to the director with substantial proof the falsity of such statement or the inappropriateness, as the case may be.

That chapter 58-5A be amended with a NEW SECTION: If an insurer subject to this chapter is deemed by the director to be in a hazardous financial condition, as defined by chapters 58-4 and 58-29B, or a condition that would be grounds for supervision, conservation, or a delinquency proceeding, then the director may require the insurer to secure and maintain either a deposit held by the director, or a bond, for the protection of the insurer for the duration of contracts or agreements or the existence of the condition for which the director required the deposit or the bond. In determining whether a deposit or a bond is required, the director may consider whether concerns exist with respect to the affiliated person\u2019s ability to fulfill the contracts or agreements if the insurer were to be put into liquidation. Once the insurer is deemed to be in a hazardous financial condition or a condition that would be grounds for supervision, conservation, or a delinquency proceeding and a deposit or bond is necessary, the director has discretion to determine the amount of the deposit or bond, not to exceed the value of the contracts or agreements in any one year, and whether the deposit or bond is required for a single contract, multiple contracts, or a contract only with a specific person or persons. Section 14. That chapter 58-5A be amended with a NEW SECTION: All records and data of the insurer held by an affiliate are and remain the property of the insurer, are subject to control of the insurer, must be identifiable, and must be segregated or readily capable of segregation, at no additional cost to the insurer, from all other persons\u2019 records and data. This includes all records and data that are otherwise the property of the insurer, in any form maintained, including claims and claim files, policyholder lists, application files, litigation files, premium records, rate books, underwriting manuals, personnel records, and financial records or similar records within the possession, custody, or control of the affiliate. At the request of the insurer, the affiliate must provide the receiver a complete set of all records of any type that pertain to the insurer\u2019s business, obtain access to the operating systems on which the data is maintained, obtain the software that runs those systems either through assumption of licensing agreements or otherwise, and restrict the use of the data by the affiliate if it is not operating the insurer\u2019s business. The affiliate must provide a waiver of any landlord lien or other encumbrance to give the insurer access to all records and data in the event of the affiliate\u2019s default under a lease or other agreement. Section 15. That chapter 58-5A be amended with a NEW SECTION: Premiums and other funds belonging to the insurer that are collected by or held by an affiliate are the exclusive property of the insurer and are subject to the control of the insurer. Any right of offset in the event an insurer is placed into receivership is subject to chapter 58-29B. Section 16. That chapter 58-5A be amended with a NEW SECTION: Any affiliate that is party to an agreement or contract with a domestic insurer that is referenced in subdivision 58-5A-56(4) is subject to the jurisdiction of any supervision, seizure, conservatorship or receivership proceedings against the insurer and to the authority of any supervisor, conservator, rehabilitator, or liquidator for the insurer appointed pursuant to chapter 58-29B for the purpose of interpreting, enforcing, and overseeing the affiliate\u2019s obligations under the agreement or contract to perform services for the insurer that: (1) Are an integral part of the insurer\u2019s operations, including management, administrative, accounting, data processing, marketing, underwriting, claims handling, investment, or any other similar functions; or (2) Are essential to the insurer\u2019s ability to fulfill its obligations under insurance policies. The director may require that an agreement or contract referenced in subsection 58-5A-21(2)(e), for the provision of services described in subdivisions (1) and (2) of this section, specify that the affiliate consents to the jurisdiction as set forth in this section."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 24738, "action_date": "2024-01-09T12:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 256993, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/256993.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 17, "committee_id_action": 1197, "committee_id_assigned": 1192, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 24738, "action_date": "2024-01-12T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 258834, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/258834.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 1192, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 24738, "action_date": "2024-01-12T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 258868, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/258868.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 1192, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 78413, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [4472, 4475, 4482, 4494, 4497, 4535, 4546, 4557, 4560, 4543, 4571], "Excused": [4519], "Nay": [4533]}}, {"bill_id": 24738, "action_date": "2024-01-16T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 259641, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/259641.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass", "journal_page": 66, "committee_id_action": 1197, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 78505, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [4472, 4473, 4474, 4475, 4476, 4478, 4482, 4483, 4485, 4486, 4489, 4491, 4492, 4494, 4495, 4496, 4497, 4499, 4500, 4503, 4504, 4505, 4506, 4509, 4510, 4511, 4513, 4514, 4518, 4519, 4520, 4521, 4522, 4524, 4525, 4527, 4528, 4530, 4531, 4532, 4533, 4534, 4535, 4538, 4540, 4542, 4543, 4544, 4545, 4546, 4548, 4549, 4551, 4552, 4553, 4555, 4556, 4557, 4560, 4561, 4562, 4563, 4565, 4566, 4568, 4569, 4570, 4571, 4575]}}, {"bill_id": 24738, "action_date": "2024-01-17T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 260025, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/260025.pdf", "status_text": "First read in Senate and referred to", "journal_page": 95, "committee_id_action": 1219, "committee_id_assigned": 1209, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 24738, "action_date": "2024-01-30T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 262930, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/262930.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 1, "committee_id_action": 1209, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}]}
