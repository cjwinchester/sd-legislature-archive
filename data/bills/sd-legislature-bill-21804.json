There shall be appointed, as provided under this chapter, at each regular session of the Legislature, a Joint Legislative Committee on Constitutional Enforcement.

Section 10. That a NEW SECTION be added: 2-18-10. Authority of Governor. This chapter does not limit or alter the authority of the Governor, the attorney general, a statewide elected official, a state or federal court, a judge or justice, a state or local appointed or elected official, or the governing body of a political subdivision of this state to issue a verbal or written opinion determining a federal action to be unconstitutional. An opinion issued under this section may be referred to the committee for review under this chapter. Section 11. That a NEW SECTION be added: 2-18-11. Effect--Determination--Federal action.

This chapter does not prohibit a public officer who has taken an oath to defend the United States Constitution from interposing to stop acts of the federal government that have been declared to be an unconstitutional federal action. South Dakota officials in federal, state, and local government shall honor their oaths to preserve, protect, and defend the United States Constitution and shall act to constitutionally defend this state and the people of this state. Section 12. That a NEW SECTION be added: 2-18-12. Attorney General--Authority. The attorney general may: (1) Defend the state to prevent the implementation and enforcement of a federal action declared to be an unconstitutional federal action; (2) Prosecute a person under \u00a7 3-16-11 who attempts to implement or enforce a federal action declared to be an unconstitutional federal action, or another provision of law; or (3) Appear before a grand jury in connection with an offense the attorney general is authorized to prosecute under this section. The authority to prosecute prescribed by this chapter does not affect the authority derived from other laws to prosecute the same offenses. Section 13. That a NEW SECTION be added: 21-24-17. Declarations--Unconstitutional acts--Federal government. Any court in this state has original jurisdiction of a proceeding seeking a declaratory judgment that a federal action effective in this state is an unconstitutional federal action. A person is entitled to declaratory relief if the court determines that a federal action is an unconstitutional federal action. In determining whether to grant declaratory relief to a person under this section, a court may not rely solely on the decisions of other courts interpreting the United States Constitution and instead shall rely on the plain meaning of the text of the United States Constitution and any applicable constitutional doctrine as understood by the original framers and authors of the United States Constitution. Section 21-24-10 does not apply to relief sought under this section. Section 14. That a NEW SECTION be added: 3-16-11. Implementation--Unconstitutional duty--Misdemeanor. Any public officer, or upon any person holding any public trust or employment, who attempts to perform a duty or implement a law declared unconstitutional under \u00a7 2-18-7 or 1-1A-1, where no special provision has been made for the punishment of such action, is guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor. Section 15. Not later than the thirtieth day following the effective date of this Act: (1) The House and Senate Judiciary Committee shall appoint the initial members of the Joint Legislative Committee on Constitutional Enforcement; and (2) The secretary of state shall forward official copies of this Act to the president of the United States, to the speaker of the House of Representatives of the Congress of the United States and the president of the Senate of the Congress of the United States, and to all members of the South Dakota delegation to Congress with the request that this Act be officially entered in the Congressional Record.
