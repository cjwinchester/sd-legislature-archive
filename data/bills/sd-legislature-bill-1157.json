BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That chapter 32-5 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: The owner of special license plates for a historical car issued pursuant to \u00a7 32-5-77 or a historical motorcycle issued pursuant to \u00a7 32-5-77.3 may purchase an annual limited use sticker for the historical plates. A limited use sticker authorizes the vehicle to be driven on public roads for a maximum of two thousand miles per year in addition to the uses authorized in \u00a7 \u00a7 32-5-77 and 32-5-77.3. To purchase the limited use sticker, the owner shall each year present at the office of the county treasurer the current odometer reading of the vehicle, the previous year's odometer reading, and a log of the miles driven during the previous twelve months for purposes allowed under \u00a7 32-5-77 or 32-5-77.3. The fee for the limited use sticker is fifteen dollars per year and is in addition to the ten dollars paid for the historical license plates. If the vehicle has exceeded the two thousand miles allowed for the year under the limited use sticker, the fee shall be increased by five cents for each mile that exceeds the two thousand mile limit. Fees collected under this section shall be credited to the state motor vehicle fund. Section 2. That \u00a7 32-5-78 be amended to read as follows: 32-5-78.
