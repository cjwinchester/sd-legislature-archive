BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That the code be amended by adding a NEW SECTION to read: The Legislature finds the following: (1) The use of racially derogatory or discriminatory school or athletic team names, mascots, or nicknames in public schools in South Dakota is antithetical to the Legislature's constitutional duty to provide a uniform system of public schools that is equally open to all; (2) Certain athletic team names, mascots, and nicknames that have been used and remain in use by other teams, including school teams, in other parts of the nation are discriminatory in singling out the Native American community for the derision to which mascots or nicknames are often subjected; (3) Many individuals and organizations interested and experienced in human relations, including the United State Commission on Civil Rights, have concluded that the use of Native American images and names in school sports is a barrier to equality and understanding, and that all residents of the United States would benefit from the discontinuance of their use; and (4) No individual or school has a cognizable interest in retaining a racially derogatory or discriminatory school or athletic team name, mascot, or nickname. Section 2. That the code be amended by adding a NEW SECTION to read: If any resident of the State of South Dakota believes that a school or athletic team name, mascot, or nickname used in a public school district is racially derogatory or discriminatory, the resident shall file a complaint with the South Dakota High School Activities Association on forms provided by the association. The association shall review the complaint and determine if the name, mascot, or nickname is racially derogatory or discriminatory. In making the determination, the association shall consult with officials from the federally recognized Indian tribe with tribal land closest to the school district in which the name, mascot, or nickname is being used. If the tribal officials consulted object to the use of the name, the association shall determine that the name, mascot, or nickname is racially derogatory or discriminatory. Any person aggrieved by a determination pursuant to this section that a school or athletic team name, mascot, or nickname is racially derogatory or discriminatory may appeal to the Office of Hearing Examiners under the provisions of chapter 1-26. Section 3. That the code be amended by adding a NEW SECTION to read: Any public school district using a school or athletic team name, mascot, or nickname that the South Dakota High School Activities Association has determined, as provided in section 2 of this Act, is racially derogatory or discriminatory shall discontinue use of the racially derogatory or discriminatory name, mascot, or nickname. Section 4. That the code be amended by adding a NEW SECTION to read: Notwithstanding the provisions of section 3 of this Act, a public school district may continue to use uniforms or other materials bearing the racially derogatory or discriminatory term that were purchased prior to the date of determination as provided in section 2 of this Act if the public school district meets the following requirements: (1) The school selects a new school or athletic team name, mascot, or nickname; (2) The school refrains from purchasing or acquiring, for the purpose of distribution or sale to students or school employees, any uniform that includes or bears the racially derogatory or discriminatory term; (3) The school refrains from purchasing or acquiring, for the purpose of distribution or sale to students or school employees, any yearbook, newspaper, program, or other similar material that includes or bears the racially derogatory or discriminatory term in its logo or cover title; and (4) The school refrains from purchasing or constructing a marquee, sign, or other new or replacement fixture that includes or bears the racially derogatory or discriminatory term, and for any existing facility which bears the racially derogatory or discriminatory term, the school shall remove the prohibited name no later than the next time the associated part of the facility is replaced in the normal course of maintenance."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 7370, "action_date": "2016-01-28T13:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 38415, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/38415.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 213, "committee_id_action": 325, "committee_id_assigned": 311, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 7370, "action_date": "2016-02-19T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 39433, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/39433.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 311, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 7370, "action_date": "2016-02-22T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 39651, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/39651.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 311, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 7370, "action_date": "2016-02-22T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 39723, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/39723.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass", "journal_page": 626, "committee_id_action": 311, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 21231, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [1040, 985, 1021, 1065, 1055, 1036, 1048, 996, 1053, 1064], "Nay": [1050, 963, 1038, 993], "Excused": [1015]}}, {"bill_id": 7370, "action_date": "2016-02-24T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 39955, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/39955.pdf", "status_text": "Hoghoused", "journal_page": 677, "committee_id_action": 325, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 21479, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [1043, 983, 964, 1039, 986, 1050, 1009, 976, 1049, 1019, 1062, 1055, 1044, 1058, 968, 1018, 1059, 992, 1006, 991, 1023, 1029, 996, 1025, 1051, 965], "Yea": [1042, 1063, 1057, 1040, 995, 1060, 1033, 980, 985, 1056, 1061, 1021, 1002, 1065, 972, 963, 1038, 987, 982, 1017, 1036, 1048, 1024, 1003, 1054, 1031, 1028, 1034, 1007, 1052, 1030, 988, 993, 1026, 981, 1069, 990, 1032, 1053, 1064, 989], "Excused": [1022, 1015, 1027]}}, {"bill_id": 7370, "action_date": "2016-02-24T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 39955, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/39955.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass Amended", "journal_page": 678, "committee_id_action": 325, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "F", "vote": {"vote_id": 21480, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [1043, 1063, 983, 964, 995, 1039, 986, 1050, 1060, 1009, 1033, 976, 1049, 1056, 1061, 1019, 1065, 972, 963, 1062, 1055, 1044, 1017, 1058, 1003, 968, 1018, 1059, 1054, 1031, 992, 1034, 1006, 991, 1052, 981, 1023, 1069, 1029, 996, 990, 1025, 1051, 965, 1064, 989], "Yea": [1042, 1057, 1040, 980, 985, 1022, 1021, 1002, 1038, 987, 982, 1036, 1048, 1024, 1028, 1007, 1030, 988, 993, 1026, 1032, 1053], "Excused": [1015, 1027]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/7370"}
