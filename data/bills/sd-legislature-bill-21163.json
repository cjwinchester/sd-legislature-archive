Section 19. That chapter 58-33 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Nothing in sections 17 or 18 of this Act requires a producer, third party administrator, insurer, or preferred provider organization to conduct due diligence with respect to a health benefit plan that it is not assisting and with respect to which it does not engage in the transacting of insurance.

Nothing in this Act limits the director's authority to use a report filed or information provided pursuant to this Act in the furtherance of any legal or regulatory action that the director, in the director's sole discretion, determines to be necessary to further the purposes of this Act. Section 9. That chapter 58-33 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Nothing in this Act prevents the director from disclosing the contents of a report or notification filed under this section to the insurance division of any other state or agency of the federal government at any time, or any other regulatory or law enforcement agency if the agency or office receiving the report or matters relating thereto agrees to hold it confidential and in a manner consistent with this Act. A report filed or notification provided under this Act is confidential and privileged from disclosure in response to a subpoena or otherwise except to the extent the director determines disclosure is appropriate to accomplish a regulatory purpose. There is no civil liability imposed on and no cause of action arises from a person's furnishing information pursuant to this Act concerning suspected, anticipated, or completed acts, if the information is provided to or received from: (1) The director or the director's employees, agents, or representatives; (2) Federal, state, or local law enforcement or regulatory officials or their employees, agents, or representatives; (3) A person involved in the prevention and detection of fraudulent insurance acts or that person's agents, employees, or representatives; or (4) The NAIC or its employees, agents, or representatives.

Section 11. That chapter 58-33 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: An insurance producer, prior to submitting an application for a stop loss policy to an insurer for a health benefit plan offered to employees, employee dependents, or a person located in this state, shall carry out appropriate due diligence to establish that the health benefit plan is not unauthorized health insurance, including measures reasonably appropriate to establish: (1) For any health benefit plan that is represented as established or maintained pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement, the health benefit plan is established or maintained under or pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement under the criteria provided under 29 CFR 2510.3-40 as of January 1, 2007; (2) The health benefit plan that is not offered by an employee leasing arrangement or professional employer organization to client employers; or (3) For any health benefit plan that is represented as established by a single employer, that the health benefit plan is covering solely employees, and dependents of employees, of the employer and the employer controls and directs the work of the employee. Section 12. That chapter 58-33 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: A third party administrator, prior to entering into any administrative contract for a health benefit plan, and prior to assisting any person with administration of a health benefit plan, covering employees of an employer or a person located in this state, shall carry out appropriate due diligence to establish that the health benefit plan is not unauthorized health insurance, including those measures reasonably appropriate to establish: (1) Through initial inquiry, contract provisions and measures to monitor and enforce compliance with the contract provisions, that for any insurance coverage that is represented as issued relating to the health benefit plan: (a) The insurer issued the policy; (b) The coverage is as represented; (c) The insurer is an admitted insurer in this state; and (d) The policy has been filed with, and approved by, the division or is exempt from filing requirements; (2) For any health benefit plan that is represented as established or maintained pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement, the health benefit plan is established or maintained under or pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement under the criteria provided under 29 CFR 2510.3-40 as of January 1, 2007; (3) For any health benefit plan that is represented as established or maintained by an employee leasing arrangement or professional employer organization, the health benefit plan is fully insured; or (4) For any health benefit plan that is represented as established by a single employer, that the health benefit plan is covering solely employees and their dependents, and the employer controls and directs the work of the employee.

The transacting of insurance includes: (1) Issuing a stop loss policy covering an employer located in this state. Coverage of an employer for claims incurred under the employer's self-funded health benefit plan with a stop loss policy is insurance, not reinsurance, regardless of whether the contract is described by the insurer as reinsurance; or (2) Issuing a stop loss policy to a trust or trustee, whether the trust or trustee is located in this state or otherwise, if an employer located in this state is directly or indirectly the beneficiary of the trust. Section 15. That chapter 58-33 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: No insurer may engage in the transacting of insurance in this state by issuing a stop loss policy unless, prior to issuing a contract for the stop loss policy, the insurer discloses clearly and conspicuously to the employer, in writing the following: (1) The employer is not covered for claims below the stop loss attachment point; (2) A description of the attachment point, including the specific and aggregate attachment points; and (3) The insurer provides no other coverage of the employer's retention.

Section 17. That chapter 58-33 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: A licensee or other person who acts according to the written advice of the MEWA contact has a defense to any violation of sections 11 to 16, inclusive, of this Act if the information provided by the licensee or other person to the MEWA contact, to the extent material to the MEWA contact's advice, is accurate and complete. For the purpose of this Act, the division's published list of admitted insurers on its web site is deemed to be accurate. A licensee or other person has a defense to any allegation that a listed insurer is not an admitted insurer. Nothing in this Act requires a licensee or other person to notify the division of an unauthorized product or insurer if that licensee or person has reviewed the division's website and the unauthorized insurer is listed as an admitted insurer. Section 18. That chapter 58-33 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Any violation of sections 10 to 16, of this Act, is mitigated, and the division shall reduce or eliminate any sanction otherwise applicable, if a licensee or other person demonstrates all of the following: (1) The licensee or other person maintained supervisory procedures and controls that complied with section 20 of this Act; (2) The violation occurred despite the maintenance of those procedures and controls; (3) The licensee or other person promptly reported the health benefit plan to the MEWA contact once the licensee or other person had actual knowledge that it was unauthorized health insurance; and (4) The licensee or other person took prompt corrective action. Section 19. That chapter 58-33 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Nothing in sections 17 or 18 of this Act requires a producer, third party administrator, insurer, or preferred provider organization to conduct due diligence with respect to a health benefit plan that it is not assisting and with respect to which it does not engage in the transacting of insurance. Section 20. That chapter 58-33 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: An insurance producer, third party administrator, insurer, preferred provider organization, or an agent of the same shall establish and maintain documented supervision procedures and controls that are reasonably designed to achieve compliance with this Act. The supervisory procedures shall include: (1) Training; (2) Internal controls; (3) Periodic audits; (4) Supervisory review; and (5) Monitoring and enforcement of contractual provisions established under sections 12 and 16 of this Act. The extent of the supervisory procedures and controls a producer is required to maintain under this section may appropriately reflect the size and complexity of the producer's operations and the scope and nature of the producer's insurance activities. Section 21. That chapter 58-33 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: An insurer providing health insurance in this state shall require its listed producers to obtain not less than one hour of continuing education every four years covering: (1) Identification of unauthorized health insurance; and (2) The producer's responsibilities under this Act. A third party administrator, preferred provider organization, or insurer shall include in its application for a license a brief summary of its procedures and controls required under section 20 of this Act. A license or registration application may be denied if the applicant fails to demonstrate that the applicant maintains the required procedures and controls. Section 22. That chapter 58-33 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: If a preferred provider organization violates a provision of this Act, the organization's registration may be suspended or revoked or other action may be taken by the director as is otherwise authorized by this title to ensure that compliance with this Act will be achieved in the future. Section 23. That chapter 58-33 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Nothing in this Act applies to a joint powers agreement authorized pursuant to chapter 1-24. Section 24. Nothing in this Act applies to an admitted insurer, nonadmitted insurer, or a MEWA if the arrangement is neither issued to a person in this state nor solicited in this state. For purposes of this section, the phrase, issued to a person, does not include providing a certificate of coverage, evidence of coverage, or other similar documents to an employee, participant, or dependent showing coverage under an employer's health benefit plan or arrangement."}, {"bill_id": 21163, "bill_version_id": 112911, "bill_version": "Enrolled", "bill_version_date":
