BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 13-28-5 be amended to read as follows: 13-28-5. The privileges of the public schools of any district shall be free to all persons with school residence within the district until they complete the secondary school program or until they reach the age of twenty-one.

That \u00a7 13-36-4 be amended to read as follows: 13-36-4. The school board of a public or the governing body of a nonpublic school, approved and accredited by the secretary of the Department of Education, may delegate, on a year to year basis, the control, supervision, and regulation of any high school interscholastic activities to any association which is voluntary and nonprofit if membership in such association is open to all high schools approved and accredited by the secretary of the Department of Education, including any school that allows participation by students receiving alternative instruction as set forth in \u00a7 13-27-3, pursuant to the provisions of this title, and if the constitution, bylaws, and rules of the association are subject to ratification by the school boards of the member public school districts and the governing boards of the member nonpublic schools and include a provision for a proper review procedure and review board. Any association which complies with this section may exercise the control, supervision, and regulation of interscholastic activities, including interscholastic athletic events of member schools. Such association may promulgate reasonable uniform rules, to make decisions and to provide and enforce reasonable penalties for the violation of such rules. No such association, however, may prevent any member public school district from charging a fee to students to participate in any interscholastic activity for which no academic credit is earned."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 1905, "action_date": "2010-02-03T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 11793, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/11793.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 289, "committee_id_action": 86, "committee_id_assigned": 73, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 1905, "action_date": "2010-02-17T07:30:00-06:00", "document_id": 12218, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/12218.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 73, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 1905, "action_date": "2010-02-17T07:30:00-06:00", "document_id": 12413, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/12413.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to the 41st legislative day", "journal_page": 444, "committee_id_action": 73, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 6593, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [825, 813, 757, 834, 783, 819, 833, 828], "Nay": [793, 817, 829, 841, 789, 801], "Excused": [763]}}]}
