BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. Any covenant not to compete, included in an employment, partnership, or corporate agreement between or among physicians, that restricts the right of a physician to practice medicine in a particular location or for a defined period of time, or both, upon the termination of the agreement is void as a matter of public policy. However, any other provision of the agreement, including an agreement that requires the payment of liquidated damages in an amount that is reasonably related to the injury suffered by reason of termination of the agreement, is enforceable. The payment of damages upon termination of the agreement may include damages related to competition. 350 copies of this document were printed by the South Dakota Legislative Research Council at a cost of $.027 per page. .
