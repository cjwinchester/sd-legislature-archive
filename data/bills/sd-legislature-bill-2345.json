BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 34-45-4 be amended to read as follows: 34-45-4. Upon compliance with \u00a7 34-45-2, the governing body may assess a monthly uniform charge in an amount not to exceed seventy-five cents per service user line. The proceeds of this charge shall be used to pay for allowable nonrecurring and recurring costs of the 911 system. Any prepaid wireless telecommunications service provider shall remit the 911 emergency surcharge for each active prepaid wireless telecommunication service user account to the South Dakota 911 coordination fund. The proceeds of the South Dakota 911 coordination fund are continuously appropriated for reimbursement of allowable nonrecurring and recurring costs of 911 service and operating expenses of the board. No such charge may be imposed upon more than one hundred service user lines or equivalent service, per customer account billed, per month. In the case of multi-station network systems, service user lines shall be equal to the number of calls that can simultaneously be made from such system to the public switched telephone network. Section 2. That \u00a7 34-45-18.2 be amended to read as follows: 34-45-18.2. The board may promulgate rules pursuant to chapter 1-26 setting: (1) Minimum technical, operational, and procedural standards for the operation and utilization of a public safety answering point; (2) Requirements and amounts for reimbursement of recurring and nonrecurring costs; and (3) Standards for coordination of effective 911 service on a statewide basis; and (4) Allowable expenditures of the 911 emergency surcharge proceeds collected pursuant to \u00a7 34-45-4. Moreover, prior to December 31, 2010, the board shall promulgate rules specifying alternative arrangements that can be utilized by a public safety answering point to comply with ARSD 50:02:04:02(2). A public safety answering point shall comply with ARSD 50:02:04:02(2) if the Legislature increases the monthly uniform charge, regardless of the amount of the increase. Furthermore, no public safety answering point may be required to comply with the provisions of ARSD 50:02:04:02(2) if the public safety answering point forswears the acceptance of revenue from any future legislative increase in the monthly uniform charge and formally resolves to continue to maintain itself pursuant to all other statutes, rules, and standards."}, {"bill_id": 2345, "bill_version_id": 16183, "bill_version": "Enrolled", "bill_version_date": "2011-02-02T10:50:43.023-06:00", "bill_text": ""}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 2345, "action_date": "2011-01-11T12:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 14785, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/14785.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 23, "committee_id_action": 115, "committee_id_assigned": 108, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 2345, "action_date": "2011-01-19T08:30:00-06:00", "document_id": 14842, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/14842.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 108, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 2345, "action_date": "2011-01-19T08:30:00-06:00", "document_id": 15069, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/15069.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass", "journal_page": 111, "committee_id_action": 108, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 7964, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [12, 53, 60, 59, 36, 61, 57, 37, 58, 5, 35, 91], "Excused": [51]}}, {"bill_id": 2345, "action_date": "2011-01-20T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 15187, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/15187.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass", "journal_page": 120, "committee_id_action": 115, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 8027, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [12, 53, 56, 17, 33, 21, 72, 60, 87, 1, 105, 48, 51, 49, 15, 59, 36, 7, 94, 104, 84, 88, 61, 90, 57, 11, 63, 70, 96, 23, 62, 54, 20, 71, 92, 28, 37, 83, 95, 58, 85, 103, 3, 32, 102, 68, 98, 67, 99, 64, 73, 69, 50, 14, 6, 86, 93, 74, 35, 97, 29, 101, 66, 100, 91, 89, 65, 47, 5], "Excused": [39]}}, {"bill_id": 2345, "action_date": "2011-01-21T13:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 15285, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/15285.pdf", "status_text": "First read in Senate and referred to", "journal_page": 165, "committee_id_action": 113, "committee_id_assigned": 98, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 2345, "action_date": "2011-01-31T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 15750, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/15750.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 98, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 2345, "action_date": "2011-01-31T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 15989, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/15989.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass", "journal_page": 236, "committee_id_action": 98, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 8298, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [44, 40, 46, 24, 26, 77, 45, 9, 34]}}, {"bill_id": 2345, "action_date": "2011-02-01T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 16134, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/16134.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass", "journal_page": 285, "committee_id_action": 113, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 8420, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [44, 75, 30, 42, 79, 46, 41, 24, 26, 25, 38, 78, 76, 18, 77, 82, 13, 55, 31, 43, 4, 16, 9, 10, 19, 81, 27, 34, 52, 80, 8, 45, 22], "Excused": [40], "Nay": [2]}}, {"bill_id": 2345, "action_date": "2011-02-02T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 16215, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/16215.pdf", "status_text": "Signed by the Speaker", "journal_page": 270, "committee_id_action": 115, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 2345, "action_date": "2011-02-03T13:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 16307, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/16307.pdf", "status_text": "Signed by the President", "journal_page": 322, "committee_id_action": 113, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 2345, "action_date": "2011-02-07T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 16422, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/16422.pdf", "status_text": "Delivered to the Governor", "journal_page": 306, "committee_id_action": 115, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 2345, "action_date": "2011-02-10T13:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 16727, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/16727.pdf", "status_text": "Signed by the Governor", "journal_page": 352, "committee_id_action": 115, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}], "session_law": 4854}
