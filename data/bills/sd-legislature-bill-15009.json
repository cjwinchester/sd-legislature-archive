WHEREAS, on Sunday, December 7, 1941, from 7:55 a.m. to 9:45 a.m., United States military installations at Pearl Harbor, Oahu, Hawaii, were attacked from the air by the naval and air forces of the Japanese empire; and WHEREAS, the attack on Pearl Harbor sunk or damaged 18 U.S. ships, destroyed or damaged 347 aircraft, and took the lives of 2,403 U.S. sailors, marines, soldiers, and civilians and wounded 1,178 more. The attack at Pearl Harbor, in terms of loss of life, remains the most costly individual, single-day U.S. military engagement of the 20th Century; and WHEREAS, the attack on Pearl Harbor, along with nearly simultaneous attacks on U.S. installations in the Philippine Islands and Guam, forced the United States to enter combat in the Second World War, probably the most destructive human conflict in history; and WHEREAS, the Pearl Harbor Survivors Association, which includes chapters in South Dakota, is an association of U.S. military personnel who were present on or near the island of Oahu on December 7, 1941, between the hours of 7:55 a.m. and 9:45 a.m., whose purpose is to honor the memory of those who gave their lives at Pearl Harbor; and WHEREAS, the designation of roadways to honor groups and individuals has become a traditional practice and would in this instance be a fitting tribute to all South Dakota veterans, but most especially to the veterans of World War II and to the young Americans who defended Pearl Harbor; and WHEREAS, the designation of U.S. Highway 83 from Fort Pierre to Interstate Highway 90 as Pearl Harbor Memorial Highway, with proper markers installed and maintained, would remind the traveling public of the sacrifices made by these veterans: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the House of Representatives of the Seventy- fifth Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the Senate concurring therein, that the South Dakota Legislature supports the designation of U.S. Highway 83 from Fort Pierre to Interstate Highway 90 as Pearl Harbor Memorial Highway and requests the Transportation Commission to make such a designation and to provide for the proper posting of that highway as a fitting means of honoring South Dakota's war-time veterans."}, {"bill_id": 15009, "bill_version_id": 87261, "bill_version": "Enrolled", "bill_version_date": "2000-02-22T00:00:00-06:00", "bill_text": "February 9, 2000 February 17, 2000"}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 15009, "action_date": "2000-02-02T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 85843, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/85843.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 653, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 15009, "action_date": "2000-02-09T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 85896, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/85896.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 653, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 15009, "action_date": "2000-02-09T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 85896, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/85896.pdf", "status_text": "Adopt Resolution", "journal_page": 527, "committee_id_action": 653, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 44120, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [2305, 2324, 2327, 2343, 2355, 2361, 2362, 2397, 2404, 2379, 2308], "Excused": [2325, 2401]}}, {"bill_id": 15009, "action_date": "2000-02-10T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 85664, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/85664.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to another day", "journal_page": 558, "committee_id_action": 656, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 15009, "action_date": "2000-02-11T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 85666, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/85666.pdf", "status_text": "Adopt Resolution", "journal_page": 604, "committee_id_action": 656, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 46208, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [2305, 2308, 2309, 2312, 2313, 2314, 2315, 2316, 2317, 2318, 2319, 2321, 2323, 2324, 2325, 2327, 2328, 2332, 2333, 2334, 2336, 2337, 2338, 2341, 2342, 2343, 2345, 2348, 2349, 2350, 2353, 2354, 2355, 2356, 2359, 2360, 2361, 2362, 2363, 2366, 2367, 2368, 2370, 2371, 2372, 2373, 2374, 2377, 2378, 2379, 2382, 2383, 2384, 2385, 2387, 2388, 2390, 2392, 2393, 2397, 2401, 2402, 2406, 2407, 2408, 2351], "Excused": [2394, 2396, 2403, 2404]}}, {"bill_id": 15009, "action_date": "2000-02-17T09:15:00-06:00", "document_id": 85953, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/85953.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 641, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 15009, "action_date": "2000-02-17T09:15:00-06:00", "document_id": 85953, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/85953.pdf", "status_text": "Concur In resolution", "journal_page": 546, "committee_id_action": 641, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 44616, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [2339, 2369, 2375, 2391, 2400, 2376], "Excused": [2398]}}, {"bill_id": 15009, "action_date": "2000-02-17T09:15:00-06:00", "document_id": 85953, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/85953.pdf", "status_text": "Place on Consent Calendar", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 641, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 15009, "action_date": "2000-02-18T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 85677, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/85677.pdf", "status_text": "Concur In resolution", "journal_page": 574, "committee_id_action": 657, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 44734, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [2304, 2306, 2307, 2310, 2311, 2320, 2322, 2326, 2329, 2330, 2331, 2335, 2339, 2340, 2344, 2346, 2347, 2352, 2357, 2358, 2364, 2365, 2369, 2375, 2376, 2380, 2381, 2386, 2389, 2391, 2395, 2398, 2399, 2400, 2405]}}]}
