BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. The Public Utilities Commission shall establish, after notice, hearing, and comment, a methodology to determine the value of electricity produced by small power production facilities as defined under the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978, for the purpose of establishing the purchase rate by investor-owned utilities of electricity generated by small power production facilities. Section 2. The methodology shall, at a minimum, account for the value of energy and its delivery, generation capacity, transmission capacity, transmission and distribution line losses, and environmental value. The Public Utilities Commission may, based on known and measurable evidence of the cost or benefit of small power production facilities to the utility, incorporate other values into the methodology, including credit for locally manufactured or assembled energy systems, systems installed at high-value locations on the distribution grid, or other factors. Section 3. The methodology shall be reviewed every five years and the Public Utilities Commission shall conduct a public hearing upon review."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 6641, "action_date": "2015-02-03T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 34394, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/34394.pdf", "status_text": "First Reading House", "journal_page": 266, "committee_id_action": 286, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 6641, "action_date": "2015-02-04T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 34477, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/34477.pdf", "status_text": "Referred to", "journal_page": 285, "committee_id_action": 286, "committee_id_assigned": 272, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 6641, "action_date": "2015-02-20T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 35167, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/35167.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 272, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 6641, "action_date": "2015-02-20T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 35371, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/35371.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to the 41st legislative day", "journal_page": 471, "committee_id_action": 272, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 18925, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [952, 956], "Yea": [931, 937, 882, 906, 950, 932, 949, 934, 957, 864], "Excused": [933]}}]}
