The term, genetic test, does not include a routine physical examination or a routine analysis, including, a chemical analysis, of body fluids, unless conducted specifically to determine the presence, absence, or mutation of a gene or chromosome, and the term, genetic test, does not include a procedure performed as a component of biomedical research that is conducted pursuant to federal common rule under 21 C.F.R. parts 50 and 56 and 45 C.F.R. part 46; (3) \"Predictive genetic test,\" a genetic test performed for the purpose of predicting the future probability that the person tested will develop a genetically related disease or disability; (4) \"Presymptomatic genetic test,\" a genetic test performed before the onset of clinical symptoms or indications of disease. Section 2. No person may order a presymptomatic or predictive genetic test without first obtaining the written, informed consent of the person to be tested. For purposes of this section, written, informed consent consists of a signed writing executed by the person to be tested or the legally authorized representative of the person to be tested that includes, at a minimum, all of the following: (1) The nature and purpose of the presymptomatic or predictive genetic test; (2) The effectiveness and limitations of the presymptomatic or predictive genetic test; (3) The implications of taking the presymptomatic or predictive genetic test, including, the medical risks and benefits; (4) The future uses of the sample taken from the person tested in order to conduct the presymptomatic or predictive genetic test and the information obtained from the presymptomatic or predictive genetic test; (5) The meaning of the presymptomatic or predictive genetic test results and the procedure for providing notice of the results to the person tested; and (6) Who will have access to the sample taken from the person tested in order to conduct the presymptomatic or predictive genetic test and the information obtained from the presymptomatic or predictive genetic test, and the person's right to confidential treatment of the sample and the information.
