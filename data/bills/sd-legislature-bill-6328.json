A person who trains a commercial driver license applicant to drive a commercial motor vehicle may not also act as the third-party tester or third-party examiner for that applicant. The department reserves the right to test or re-examine any applicant certified by a third-party examiner. Section 53. That ARSD 61:25:04:19 be amended to read as follows: 61:25:04:19.

The department may cancel in its entirety the third-party testing program provided for in this chapter. The department may revoke the license certificate of a third-party tester or examiner on the following grounds: (1) Failure to comply with or satisfy any of the provisions of this chapter or the third-party tester agreement; (2) Falsification of records or information relating to the third-party testing program; (3) For third-party examiner, driver license suspension, revocation, recall, or disqualifications; and (4) Commission of any act or omission which, in the judgment of the department, compromises the integrity of the third-party program. If the department determines that grounds for cancellation exist for failure to comply with or satisfy any of the requirements in this chapter or in the third-party tester agreement, the department may postpone cancellation and allow the third-party tester or examiner 30 days to correct the deficiency. Section 54. That chapter 32-12A be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Each state and third-party test examiner shall successfully complete a refresher course and examination every four years to maintain the examiner's commercial driver license test examiner certification. The refresher training course shall cover at least the following: (1) For a commercial driver license knowledge test examiner: (a) Introduction to CDL licensing system; (b) Overview of the CDL tests; and (c) Knowledge tests; (2) For a commercial driver license skills test examiner: (a) Introduction to CDL licensing system; (b) Overview of the CDL tests; (c) Vehicle inspection test; (d) Basic control skills testing; and (e) Road test; and (3) The refresher training for each examiner shall include any state-specific material and information related to administering CDL knowledge and skills tests, and any new federal CDL regulation, any update to administering the tests, and new safety related equipment on a vehicle. The skills testing certification of any examiner who does not conduct skills test examinations of at least ten different applicants per calendar year shall be revoked, unless the examiner either takes the refresher training or has a state examiner ride along to observe the third-party examiner successfully administer at least one skills test. Section 55. That chapter 32-12A be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: In addition to the insurance requirements set forth by the department, each third-party tester shall initiate and maintain a bond in the amount of ten thousand dollars. The bond shall pay for retesting drivers in the event that the third-party tester or one or more of its examiners is involved in fraudulent activity related to conducting skills testing of applicants for a commercial driver license. A third-party tester that is a governmental entity is not required to maintain a bond."}, {"bill_id": 6328, "bill_version_id": 35880, "bill_version": "Enrolled", "bill_version_date":
