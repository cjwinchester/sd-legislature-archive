BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. The Legislature finds that state demographics show that youth under age eighteen comprise nearly fifty percent of the population on some Indian reservations within South Dakota, and the number of youth under age eighteen is rising. This growing youth population on the Sioux Indian reservations lives within nine counties that have the lowest per capita income in the state and there is a general lack of recreation centers and after school youth programs. Assistance in studying the specific need for constructing recreation centers and creating after school programs would encourage these students to be more strongly involved in positive activities. Section 2. The South Dakota Departments of Social Services, Health, and Education and Cultural Affairs shall conduct a study of the need to help develop youth recreation centers and after school youth programs within the Sioux Indian reservations in South Dakota. The study shall be completed by September 30, 2003, and forwarded to the Legislative Research Council. 350 copies of this document were printed by the South Dakota Legislative Research Council at a cost of $.027 per page. .
