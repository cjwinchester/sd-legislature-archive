Appointments to county offices shall be filed in the office of the county auditor and entered in the minutes of the commissioners' proceedings. Section 2. That \u00a7 7-8-2 be amended to read as follows: 7-8-2. The nomination and election of county commissioners shall be by a vote of the voters of the district of which such candidate is a resident voter.
