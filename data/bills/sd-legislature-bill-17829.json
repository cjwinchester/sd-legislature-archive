Section 50. That chapter 58-17C be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: A health carrier shall establish written procedures for the expedited review of urgent care requests of grievances involving an adverse determination. In addition, a health carrier shall provide expedited review of a grievance involving an adverse determination with respect to concurrent review urgent care requests involving an admission, availability of care, continued stay, or health care service for a covered person who has received emergency services, but has not been discharged from a facility. The procedures shall allow a covered person or the covered person's authorized representative to request an expedited review under this section orally or in writing. A health carrier shall appoint an appropriate clinical peer or peers in the same or similar specialty as would typically manage the case being reviewed to review the adverse determination. The clinical peer or peers may not have been involved in making the initial adverse determination. Section 51. That chapter 58-17C be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: In an expedited review, all necessary information, including the health carrier's decision, shall be transmitted between the health carrier and the covered person or, if applicable, the covered person's authorized representative by telephone, facsimile, or the most expeditious method available. Section 52. That chapter 58-17C be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: An expedited review decision shall be made and the covered person or, if applicable, the covered person's authorized representative shall be notified of the decision in accordance with section 53 of this Act as expeditiously as the covered person's medical condition requires, but in no event more than seventy-two hours after the date of receipt of the request for the expedited review. If the expedited review is of a grievance involving an adverse determination with respect to a concurrent review urgent care request, the service shall be continued without liability to the covered person until the covered person has been notified of the determination. For purposes of calculating the time periods within which a decision is required to be made under this section, the time period within which the decision is required to be made shall begin on the date the request is filed with the health carrier in accordance with the health carrier's procedures established pursuant to section 33 of this Act for filing a request without regard to whether all of the information necessary to make the determination accompanies the filing. Section 53. That chapter 58-17C be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: A notification of a decision under sections 50 to 53, inclusive, of this Act shall, in a manner calculated to be understood by the covered person or, if applicable, the covered person's authorized representative, set forth the following: (1) The titles and qualifying credentials of the person or persons participating in the expedited review process (the reviewers); (2) A statement of the reviewers' understanding of the covered person's grievance; (3) The reviewers' decision in clear terms and the contract basis or medical rationale in sufficient detail for the covered person to respond further to the health carrier's position; (4) A reference to the evidence or documentation used as the basis for the decision; (5) If the decision involves an adverse determination, the notice shall provide: (a) The reasons for the adverse determination; (b) A reference to the specific plan provisions on which the determination is based; (c) A description of any additional material or information necessary for the covered person to complete the request, including an explanation of why the material or information is necessary to complete the request; (d) If the health carrier relied upon an internal rule, guideline, protocol, or other similar criterion to make the adverse determination, either the specific rule, guideline, protocol, or other similar criterion or a statement that a specific rule, guideline, protocol, or other similar criterion was relied upon to make the adverse determination and that a copy of the rule, guideline, protocol, or other similar criterion will be provided free of charge to the covered person upon request; (e) If the adverse determination is based on a medical necessity or experimental or investigational treatment or similar exclusion or limit, either an explanation of the scientific or clinical judgment for making the determination, applying the terms of the health benefit plan to the covered person's medical circumstances or a statement that an explanation will be provided to the covered person free of charge upon request; (f) If applicable, instructions for requesting: (i) A copy of the rule, guideline, protocol, or other similar criterion relied upon in making the adverse determination as provided in subsection (d) of this section; or (ii) The written statement of the scientific or clinical rationale for the adverse determination as provided in subsection (e) of this section; (g) A statement indicating the covered person's right to bring a civil action in a court of competent jurisdiction; and (h) The following statement: \"You and your plan may have other voluntary alternative dispute resolution options, such as mediation. One way to find out what may be available is to contact your state insurance director.\"; and (i) A notice of the covered person's right to contact the Division of Insurance for assistance at any time, including the telephone number and address of the Division of Insurance. A health carrier may provide the notice required under this section orally, in writing, or electronically. If notice of the adverse determination is provided orally, the health carrier shall provide written or electronic notice of the adverse determination within three days following the date of the oral notification. Section 54. The director may promulgate rules, pursuant to chapter 1-26, pertaining to claims for group disability income plans. The rules shall be consistent with applicable federal requirements included in 29 CFR Part 2560. Section 55. That chapter 58-17C be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: For the purposes of this chapter, the term, urgent care request, means a request for a health care service or course of treatment with respect to which the time periods for making a nonurgent care request determination: (1) Could seriously jeopardize the life or health of the covered person or the ability of the covered person to regain maximum function; or (2) In the opinion of a physician with knowledge of the covered person's medical condition, would subject the covered person to severe pain that cannot be adequately managed without the health care service or treatment that is the subject of the request. Except as provided in subdivision (1), in determining whether a request is to be treated as an urgent care request, an individual acting on behalf of the health carrier shall apply the judgment of a prudent layperson who possesses an average knowledge of health and medicine. Any request that a physician with knowledge of the covered person's medical condition determines is an urgent care request within the meaning of subdivisions (1) and (2) shall be treated as an urgent care request."}, {"bill_id": 17829, "bill_version_id": 98252, "bill_version": "Enrolled", "bill_version_date": "2003-03-03T14:54:38-06:00", "bill_text": ""}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [],
