BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That chapter 10-45 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Any fee or commission received by an auctioneer for auctioning tangible personal property of a client does not constitute gross receipts subject to the tax imposed by chapter 10-45. Section 2. That \u00a7 10-45-92 be repealed. 10-45-92. In determining the amount of tax due under this chapter, auctioneers may deduct from gross receipts amounts which represent direct expense charges for clients for tangible personal property or services purchased by the auctioneer on behalf of a client. However, the sale of the property or service to the auctioneer is not a sale for resale if this deduction is taken. This deduction may only be taken if the amount to be deducted represents an expense specifically incurred for a particular client and the amount is itemized and paid from the client's auction proceeds by the auctioneer or closing agent. The deduction shall be disallowed if the auctioneer receives any profit or remuneration directly or indirectly from the client's expense. 350 copies of this document were printed by the South Dakota Legislative Research Council at a cost of $.027 per page. .
