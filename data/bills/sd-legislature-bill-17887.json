BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 22-22-30.1 be amended to read as follows: 22-22-30.1. Criminal pedophilia is any act of sexual penetration accomplished with a victim less than thirteen years of age by any person twenty-six years of age or older under any circumstances not constituting incest as defined in subdivision 22-22-1(6). Criminal pedophilia is a Class 1 felony. If any person is convicted of criminal pedophilia, the court shall impose a minimum sentence of twenty-five years for a first offense. If any person is convicted for a second offense, the court shall impose a sentence of life without parole. Any subsequent conviction for criminal pedophilia, if the criminal act was committed after a prior conviction for criminal pedophilia, is a Class A felony. The court shall impose the death penalty for any Class A felony conviction pursuant to this section unless the court finds, from clear and convincing evidence of mitigating circumstances, that imposition of the death penalty would be inappropriate or unjust. 350 copies of this document were printed by the South Dakota Legislative Research Council at a cost of $.027 per page. .
