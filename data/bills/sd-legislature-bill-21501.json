BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That chapter 41-6 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: The Game, Fish and Parks Commission shall promulgate rules pursuant to chapter 1-26 to authorize the Department of Game, Fish and Parks to issue up to one thousand special nonresident duck hunting licenses valid for use in Brule, Charles Mix, Douglas, Gregory, and Lyman counties. The rules shall specify the form of the licenses issued and the license fee. A special nonresident duck hunting license entitles to licensee to hunt ducks for ten consecutive days. The special nonresident duck hunting license is valid during the same period as a resident license authorizing the hunting of ducks. No waterfowl other than ducks may be hunted under a special nonresident duck hunting license. Section 2. That \u00a7 41-6-18.1 be amended to read as follows: 41-6-18.1. It is a Class 2 misdemeanor for a nonresident to hunt, take, or kill migratory waterfowl without a special nonresident waterfowl license, a fall three-day temporary nonresident waterfowl license, early fall Canada goose temporary nonresident license, or a spring snow goose temporary nonresident license, or a special nonresident duck hunting license, a migratory bird certification permit, and a federal migratory bird stamp, or in violation of the conditions of the licenses or the rules of the Game, Fish and Parks Commission. A special nonresident waterfowl license, except as otherwise provided in this title, entitles the licensee to hunt migratory waterfowl for ten consecutive days. Four dollars received from the sale of each special nonresident waterfowl license shall be placed in the land acquisition and development fund. The moneys from this fund shall be used to acquire by purchase or lease real property to be used primarily for game production. This license shall be in such form as the Game, Fish and Parks Commission shall prescribe. The provision in this section limiting the validity of a special nonresident waterfowl license to ten consecutive days does not apply in Union, Clay, Bon Homme, Yankton, and Charles Mix counties; and in such counties, the special nonresident waterfowl license is valid during the same period as is a resident waterfowl license. The Game, Fish and Parks Commission may issue no more than four thousand special nonresident waterfowl licenses in a calendar year."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 21501, "action_date": "2007-01-25T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 110857, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/110857.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 197, "committee_id_action": 923, "committee_id_assigned": 909, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 21501, "action_date": "2007-02-01T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 111347, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/111347.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 909, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 21501, "action_date": "2007-02-06T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 111618, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/111618.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 909, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 21501, "action_date": "2007-02-08T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 111819, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/111819.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 909, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 21501, "action_date": "2007-02-08T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 111819, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/111819.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass,", "journal_page": 408, "committee_id_action": 909, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 64822, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [3584, 3587, 3616, 3620, 3640, 3672, 3578], "Nay": [3597, 3609, 3653, 3660, 3673], "Excused": [3605]}}, {"bill_id": 21501, "action_date": "2007-02-09T13:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 111953, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/111953.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to another day", "journal_page": 434, "committee_id_action": 923, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 21501, "action_date": "2007-02-12T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 112085, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/112085.pdf", "status_text": "Motion to Amend,", "journal_page": 467, "committee_id_action": 923, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 21501, "action_date": "2007-02-12T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 112085, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/112085.pdf", "status_text": "Motion to Amend,", "journal_page": 467, "committee_id_action": 923, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 21501, "action_date": "2007-02-12T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 112085, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/112085.pdf", "status_text": "Tabled", "journal_page": 468, "committee_id_action": 923, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 67092, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [3572, 3576, 3577, 3578, 3579, 3580, 3588, 3590, 3592, 3593, 3594, 3597, 3598, 3599, 3600, 3604, 3605, 3606, 3609, 3611, 3613, 3616, 3620, 3622, 3624, 3628, 3629, 3631, 3632, 3635, 3637, 3638, 3640, 3643, 3644, 3646, 3648, 3649, 3650, 3651, 3653, 3654, 3655, 3656, 3657, 3658, 3660, 3662, 3663, 3665, 3666, 3668, 3672, 3673, 3674, 3675, 3676, 3584], "Nay": [3581, 3583, 3586, 3587, 3591, 3619, 3642, 3645, 3671], "Excused": [3582, 3614, 3670]}}]}
