Upon such petition being filed the court must fix a time and place for hearing thereon, notice to be given as provided by this chapter and upon such hearing shall enter an order assuming supervision unless good cause to the contrary is shown. Thereupon the trustee must shall within thirty days , file the same papers as required information required pursuant to \u00a7 21-22-3 by a trustee under a court trust, and at all times thereafter the court shall have the same powers as over a court trust. If the petition for court supervision includes the information required pursuant to \u00a7 21-22-3, the trustee or beneficiary may in the same petition request court action as to any matter relevant to the administration of the trust.

If any person is construed to retain any right in property due to the fact that the person's conveyance was to a trust, estate or guardianship, and if no action or proceeding to enforce such right was commenced prior to July 1, 1992 2003 , such right shall be forever barred.
