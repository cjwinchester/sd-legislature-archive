Section 19. That chapter 36-11A be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Prescription drugs may be furnished to a hospital pharmacy receiving area provided that a pharmacist or authorized receiving personnel signs, at the time of delivery, a receipt showing the type and quantity of the prescription drug so received.

The implementation date for the mandated electronic track and trace pedigree technology shall be no sooner than July 1, 2010, and may be extended by the board in one year increments if it appears the technology is not universally available across the entire prescription pharmaceutical supply chain. Section 23. That chapter 36-11A be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Each person who is engaged in the wholesale distribution of a prescription drug including repackagers, but excluding the original manufacturer of the finished form of the prescription drug, who is provided a pedigree for a prescription drug and attempts to further distribute that prescription drug, shall affirmatively verify before any distribution of a prescription drug occurs that each transaction listed on the pedigree has occurred.
