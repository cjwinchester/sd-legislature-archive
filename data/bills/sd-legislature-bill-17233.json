BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That chapter 10-12 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Notwithstanding the provisions of \u00a7 \u00a7 10-12-42 to 10-12-44, inclusive, the governing body of a school district may raise additional revenue from taxes on real property, for general fund purposes only, through imposition of a cumulative new construction property tax levy. The cumulative new construction property tax levy is calculated as follows: (1) The county auditor shall maintain an account of the increase in assessed value resulting from a change in use that occurs, or improvements to real property that are completed during the year. The account shall identify the change in use and improvements in accordance with the categories described in \u00a7 10-12-42.1; (2) If the school district's general fund balance percentage calculated pursuant to subdivision 13-13-10.1(8) is greater than twenty percent, the value of subdivision (2) is zero (0); otherwise, multiply the value of each category of the new construction account times the maximum tax levies authorized by \u00a7 10-12-42.1 for the upcoming tax year; (3) Multiply the school district's average daily membership for the most recently completed school fiscal year calculated pursuant to subdivision 13-13-10.1(1) times the per student allocation for the current school fiscal year prescribed in subdivision 13-13-10.1(4); (4) Multiply the product of subdivision (3) times 0.04; (5) Take the lesser of subdivision (2) or subdivision (4); (6) Add the result of subdivision (5) to the cumulative new construction tax levied for the previous year. Section 2. That chapter 10-12 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: The amount calculated in section 1 of this Act is the maximum amount of additional revenue that may be raised by a school district through imposition of the cumulative new construction tax levy. The cumulative new construction tax levy shall be assessed on all real property in the school district, in accordance with the categories and in the same proportion to each other as represented by the mathematical relationship of the maximum levies authorized in \u00a7 10-12-42.1, and shall be assessed as otherwise provided by law. The additional revenue authorized by this Act is not included in the definition of local effort in subdivision 13-13-10.1(6) and is not subject to the procedural or referendum provision of \u00a7 10-12-42."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 17233, "action_date": "2002-01-18T13:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 92411, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/92411.pdf", "status_text": "First read in Senate and referred to", "journal_page": 122, "committee_id_action": 769, "committee_id_assigned": 744, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 17233, "action_date": "2002-02-05T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 93637, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/93637.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 744, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 17233, "action_date": "2002-02-05T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 93637, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/93637.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass,", "journal_page": 372, "committee_id_action": 744, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 52089, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [2740], "Yea": [2762, 2772, 2792, 2796, 2802, 2733]}}, {"bill_id": 17233, "action_date": "2002-02-06T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 93846, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/93846.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass,", "journal_page": 417, "committee_id_action": 769, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 52299, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [2726, 2733, 2734, 2739, 2742, 2743, 2753, 2762, 2772, 2778, 2780, 2787, 2791, 2792, 2795, 2796, 2802, 2809, 2810, 2819, 2828, 2829], "Nay": [2727, 2730, 2745, 2746, 2747, 2750, 2760, 2761, 2784, 2818, 2821, 2827], "Excused": [2740]}}, {"bill_id": 17233, "action_date": "2002-02-07T13:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 93950, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/93950.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 529, "committee_id_action": 768, "committee_id_assigned": 757, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 17233, "action_date": "2002-02-12T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 94189, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/94189.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 757, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 17233, "action_date": "2002-02-14T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 94394, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/94394.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 757, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 17233, "action_date": "2002-02-14T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 94394, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/94394.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to 36th legislative day", "journal_page": 660, "committee_id_action": 757, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 52692, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [2728, 2741, 2752, 2790, 2794, 2826], "Yea": [2729, 2757, 2766, 2775, 2783, 2789, 2830, 2816, 2751]}}, {"bill_id": 17233, "action_date": "2002-02-14T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 94394, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/94394.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to 36th legislative day", "journal_page": 660, "committee_id_action": 757, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 52692, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [2728, 2741, 2752, 2790, 2794, 2826], "Yea": [2729, 2757, 2766, 2775, 2783, 2789, 2830, 2816, 2751]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/17233"}
