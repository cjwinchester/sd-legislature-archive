The Governor or the Governor's designee shall serve as the chair of the council. In 2013 and 2014, the council shall meet once each year to monitor the progress of the public postsecondary education systems and institutions toward the goals established in section 3 of this Act. Section 7. Beginning in 2015, and in every year immediately following a gubernatorial election thereafter, the Council on Higher Education Policy Goals, Performance, and Accountability shall meet to review, endorse, and recommend to the executive branch, the Legislature, and the respective postsecondary education governing boards the four-year goals for the public postsecondary education systems and institutions and the performance metrics by which the council will monitor the progress toward those goals. The initial goals established by the council shall take effect on July 1, 2015, and subsequent goals will take effect every four years thereafter. In intervening years, the council shall meet annually to monitor the progress toward the goals. When establishing goals and performance metrics, the council shall draw upon public input from any persons who may be concerned or knowledgeable in these areas. A majority of the members appointed to the council constitutes a quorum for the purposes of conducting business. Any action may be taken by a vote of the majority of the members present at a meeting. The duties of the council include only those stipulated in this Act and do not impinge on the constitutional powers and duties of the Board of Regents or the legislative powers and duties of the Board of Education or include participation in the operation, management, or oversight of any postsecondary education institution in the state. Section 8. The Board of Regents and the Board of Education shall each provide to the Council on Higher Education Policy Goals, Performance, and Accountability an annual accountability report. The initial accountability report, to be provided to the council in 2013, shall contain, for each of the postsecondary education institutions under the respective board's control, information on the following: (1) Improvements in on-time degree completions; (2) Affordability for students; (3) The placement of graduates in jobs or further study in South Dakota; and (4) Improvements in the percentages of graduates who are successful in passing licensure, certification, or exit exams administered by third parties. The council shall determine the content of subsequent accountability reports. Section 9. To achieve the public purpose and goals established for postsecondary education in the state pursuant to this Act, the state funding for postsecondary education systems may be calculated as follows: (1) If the projected state general fund increase for the next fiscal year is equal to or greater than the cost of the inflationary increase established in this subdivision, the postsecondary education systems shall receive, through the normal budgeting process, an operating budget inflationary increase equal to the annual percentage change in the consumer price index for urban wage earners and clerical workers as computed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States Department of Labor for the year before the year immediately preceding the year of adjustment or three percent, whichever is less. For the purpose of this section, the operating budget does not include any portion of the budget that contains funding for salaries and benefits for any employees provided by the Legislature through the General Appropriations Act; (2) If the postsecondary education systems receive the inflationary increase in subdivision (1) and the cost of that increase is less than the projected state general fund increase, the postsecondary education institutions may also receive, through the normal budgeting process, a mission expansion increase calculated pursuant to this subsection to reflect expanded student services and increases in enrollments and credit hour completions. If the inflationary increase calculated in subdivision (1) and the amount calculated in this subdivision for a mission expansion increase is greater than the projected state general fund increase, each postsecondary education institution shall receive a pro rata share of the total amount calculated. The mission expansion increase shall be calculated as follows: (a) Each institution shall receive a payment equal to one-half of the average state appropriation per postsecondary student for each full-time equivalent enrollment in the previous fiscal year that exceeded the total full-time equivalent enrollment in the year preceding the previous fiscal year; and (b) Each institution shall also receive a payment equal to one-half of the average state appropriation per postsecondary student for each full-time equivalent of credit hour completions in the previous fiscal year that exceeded the total full-time equivalent of credit hour completions in the year preceding the previous fiscal year. The full-time equivalent of credit hour completions for which an institution is entitled to a payment pursuant to this section shall be calculated as follows: (i) For the previous fiscal year, at each degree level, divide the total number of credit hours completed at that institution by the number of credit hours required to be a full-time equivalent student; (ii) For the year prior to the previous fiscal year, at each degree level, divide the total number of credit hours completed at that institution by the number of credit hours required to be a full-time equivalent student; (iii) If the product of subsection (i) is greater than the product of subsection (ii), calculate the difference between the two at each degree level; and (iv) Add together the results for each degree level; In addition to the mission expansion funding calculated pursuant to this subsection, the Legislature may also provide additional funding to institutions for the expansion of program mission; (3) If the postsecondary education systems receive the inflationary increase in subdivision (1) and the postsecondary education institutions receive the mission expansion increase in subdivision (2), and the cost of both increases is less than the projected state general fund increase, the postsecondary education systems may receive additional funding through the normal budgeting process for performance funding. Any sum appropriated from the general fund for the purpose of performance funding shall be provided to the postsecondary education systems. The governing board of each postsecondary education system shall then determine the allocation of funds to the institutions it governs that reflect institutional performance and system strategic investments. For fiscal years 2014 and 2015, funds appropriated for performance funding shall be awarded to the postsecondary education institutions based on improvements in the following areas: (a) For institutions under the control of the Board of Regents: (i) One-half of the performance funding shall be based on the number of new graduates with special emphasis on those graduates with degrees in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics or other critical need areas as determined by the Council on Higher Education Policy Goals, Performance, and Accountability established in section 6 of this Act; and (ii) One-half of the funding shall be based on the growth of expenditures for research; (b) For the postsecondary technical institutes, the performance funding shall be based upon the number of new graduates with special emphasis on those graduates in the areas of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics and other critical need areas as determined by the Council of Higher Education Policy Goals, Performance and Accountability. For fiscal year 2016 and in subsequent fiscal years, the performance funding shall be awarded to the postsecondary education systems based on criteria established by the Council of Higher Education Policy Goals, Performance and Accountability."}, {"bill_id": 92, "bill_version_id": 23952, "bill_version": "Senate Education Engrossed", "bill_version_date": "2013-01-17T13:50:35.843-06:00", "bill_text": "FOR AN ACT ENTITLED, An Act to establish the public purpose and goals of postsecondary education, to provide for the funding of higher education, and to create the Council on Higher Education Policy Goals, Performance, and Accountability.

If the inflationary increase calculated in subdivision (1), the performance funding provided pursuant to subdivision (2), and the amount calculated in this subdivision for a mission expansion increase is greater than the projected state general fund increase, each higher education institution shall receive a pro rata share of the total amount calculated. The mission expansion increase shall be calculated as follows: (a) Each institution of higher education shall receive a payment equal to one-half of the average state appropriation per higher education student for each full-time equivalent enrollment in the previous fiscal year that exceeded the total full-time equivalent enrollment in the year preceding the previous fiscal year; and (b) Each institution of higher education shall also receive a payment equal to one-half of the average state appropriation per higher education student for each full-time equivalent of credit hour completions in the previous fiscal year that exceeded the total full-time equivalent of credit hour completions in the year preceding the previous fiscal year. The full-time equivalent of credit hour completions for which an institution is entitled to a payment pursuant to this section shall be calculated as follows: (i) For the previous fiscal year, at each degree level, divide the total number of credit hours completed at that institution by the number of credit hours required to be a full-time equivalent student; (ii) For the year prior to the previous fiscal year, at each degree level, divide the total number of credit hours completed at that institution by the number of credit hours required to be a full-time equivalent student; (iii) If the product of subsection (i) is greater than the product of subsection (ii), calculate the difference between the two at each degree level; and (iv) Add together the results for each degree level; In addition to the mission expansion funding calculated pursuant to this subsection, the Legislature may also provide additional funding to institutions of higher education for the expansion of program mission."}, {"bill_id": 92, "bill_version_id": 24426, "bill_version": "Senate Engrossed", "bill_version_date": "2013-01-23T15:09:30.493-06:00", "bill_text": "FOR AN ACT ENTITLED, An Act to establish the public purpose and goals of postsecondary education, to provide for the funding of higher education, and to create the Council on Higher Education Policy Goals, Performance, and Accountability.

For fiscal years 2014 and 2015, funds appropriated for performance funding shall be awarded to the higher education institutions based on improvements in the following areas: (a) One-half of the performance funding shall be based on the number of new graduates with special emphasis on those graduates with degrees in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics or other critical need areas as determined by the Council on Higher Education Policy Goals, Performance, and Accountability established in section 6 of this Act; and (b) One-half of the funding shall be based on the growth of expenditures for research; For fiscal year 2016 and in subsequent fiscal years, the performance funding shall be awarded to the Board of Regents based on criteria established by the Council of Higher Education Policy Goals, Performance and Accountability; and (2) If the higher education system receives the performance funding in subdivision (1), and the cost of the performance funding is less than the projected state general fund increase, the higher education institutions may also receive, through the normal budgeting process, a mission expansion increase calculated pursuant to this subsection to reflect expanded student services and increases in enrollments and credit hour completions. If the performance funding provided pursuant to subdivision (1), and the amount calculated in this subdivision for a mission expansion increase is greater than the projected state general fund increase, each higher education institution shall receive a pro rata share of the total amount calculated. The mission expansion increase shall be calculated as follows: (a) Each institution of higher education shall receive a payment equal to one-half of the average state appropriation per higher education student for each full-time equivalent enrollment in the previous fiscal year that exceeded the total full-time equivalent enrollment in the year preceding the previous fiscal year; and (b) Each institution of higher education shall also receive a payment equal to one-half of the average state appropriation per higher education student for each full-time equivalent of credit hour completions in the previous fiscal year that exceeded the total full-time equivalent of credit hour completions in the year preceding the previous fiscal year. The full-time equivalent of credit hour completions for which an institution is entitled to a payment pursuant to this section shall be calculated as follows: (i) For the previous fiscal year, at each degree level, divide the total number of credit hours completed at that institution by the number of credit hours required to be a full-time equivalent student; (ii) For the year prior to the previous fiscal year, at each degree level, divide the total number of credit hours completed at that institution by the number of credit hours required to be a full-time equivalent student; (iii) If the product of subsection (i) is greater than the product of subsection (ii), calculate the difference between the two at each degree level; and (iv) Add together the results for each degree level. In addition to the mission expansion funding calculated pursuant to this subsection, the Legislature may also provide additional funding to institutions of higher education for the expansion of program mission; and (3) If the higher education system receives the performance funding in subdivision (1) and the mission expansion increase in subdivision (2), and the cost of both of the increases is less than the projected state general fund increase, the higher education system may receive, through the normal budgeting process, an operating budget inflationary increase equal to the annual percentage change in the consumer price index for urban wage earners and clerical workers as computed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States Department of Labor for the year before the year immediately preceding the year of adjustment or three percent, whichever is less. For the purpose of this section, the operating budget does not include any portion of the budget that contains funding for salaries and benefits for any employees provided by the Legislature through the General Appropriations Act."}, {"bill_id": 92, "bill_version_id": 27399, "bill_version": "Conference Committee Engrossed", "bill_version_date": "2013-03-07T18:40:01.993-06:00", "bill_text": "FOR AN ACT ENTITLED, An Act to establish the public purpose and goals of postsecondary education, to provide for the funding of higher education, and to create the Council on Higher Education Policy Goals, Performance, and Accountability.
