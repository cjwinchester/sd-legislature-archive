When counting a student who meets these criteria in its general enrollment average daily membership, the receiving district may begin the enrollment on the first day of attendance. The district of residence prior to the custodial transfer may not include students who meet these criteria in its general enrollment average daily membership after the student ceases to attend school in the resident district; (2) \"Adjusted average daily membership,\" calculated as follows: (a) For districts with an average daily membership of two hundred or less, multiply 1.2 times the average daily membership; (b) For districts with an average daily membership of less than six hundred, but greater than two hundred, raise the average daily membership to the 0.8293 power and multiply the result times 2.98; (c) For districts with an average daily membership of six hundred or more, multiply 1.0 times their average daily membership; (3) \"Index factor,\" is the annual percentage change in the consumer price index for urban wage earners and clerical workers as computed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States Department of Labor for the year before the year immediately preceding the year of adjustment or three percent, whichever is less; (4) \"Per student allocation,\" for the period January 1, 1997, to June 30, 1997, inclusive, is $1,675. For school fiscal year 1998, beginning on July 1, 1997, the per student allocation shall be $3,350 increased by the index factor. Each school fiscal year thereafter, the per student allocation shall be the previous fiscal year's per student allocation increased by the index factor; (5) \"Local need,\" the per student allocation multiplied by the adjusted average daily membership; (6) \"Local effort,\" the amount of ad valorem taxes generated in a school fiscal year by applying the levies established pursuant to \u00a7 10-12-42. However, local effort does not include taxes generated by applying the levies established pursuant to \u00a7 10-12-42 to property formerly owned by the State of South Dakota and operated as the State Cement Plant in Pennington County."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 16088, "action_date": "2001-01-22T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 88203, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/88203.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 130, "committee_id_action": 712, "committee_id_assigned": 708, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 16088, "action_date": "2001-01-30T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 88935, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/88935.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 708, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 16088, "action_date": "2001-01-30T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 88935, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/88935.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass,", "journal_page": 260, "committee_id_action": 708, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 50865, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [2543, 2544, 2546, 2557, 2560, 2570, 2587, 2594, 2610, 2612, 2526], "Nay": [2588, 2603, 2618, 2563]}}, {"bill_id": 16088, "action_date": "2001-01-30T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 88935, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/88935.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass,", "journal_page": 260, "committee_id_action": 708, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 50865, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [2543, 2544, 2546, 2557, 2560, 2570, 2587, 2594, 2610, 2612, 2526], "Nay": [2588, 2603, 2618, 2563]}}, {"bill_id": 16088, "action_date": "2001-01-31T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 89103, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/89103.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to another day", "journal_page": 292, "committee_id_action": 712, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 16088, "action_date": "2001-02-05T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 89340, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/89340.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to another day", "journal_page": 341, "committee_id_action": 712, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 16088, "action_date": "2001-02-07T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 89530, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/89530.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to another day", "journal_page": 385, "committee_id_action": 712, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 16088, "action_date": "2001-02-12T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 89839, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/89839.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to another day", "journal_page": 450, "committee_id_action": 712, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 16088, "action_date": "2001-02-13T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 89973, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/89973.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass,", "journal_page": 476, "committee_id_action": 712, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "F", "vote": {"vote_id": 51514, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [2514, 2518, 2519, 2521, 2522, 2525, 2527, 2528, 2530, 2537, 2538, 2541, 2543, 2544, 2545, 2546, 2547, 2548, 2553, 2554, 2555, 2556, 2559, 2560, 2561, 2563, 2564, 2565, 2566, 2568, 2571, 2572, 2574, 2575, 2577, 2578, 2582, 2583, 2586, 2587, 2588, 2589, 2592, 2593, 2594, 2595, 2596, 2600, 2601, 2602, 2603, 2604, 2605, 2608, 2611, 2613, 2614, 2618, 2540], "Yea": [2515, 2526, 2533, 2557, 2558, 2570, 2579, 2591, 2599, 2610, 2612]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/16088"}
