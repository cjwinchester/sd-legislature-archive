Any school district that is not sparse and has a fall enrollment of one hundred or less on July 1, 2007, shall prepare a plan for reorganization by June 30, 2009. After July 1, 2007, if the fall enrollment of any school district that is not sparse falls to one hundred or below, that school district shall prepare a plan for reorganization within two years. If any such district fails to prepare a plan for reorganization by the deadline, the Board of Education shall prepare a reorganization plan for the district; or (2) Receive, beginning two years following the school fiscal year in which the fall enrollment fell below one hundred, a reduced amount of state aid to education funding that is calculated by dividing the school district's fall enrollment by one hundred and multiplying the result by the foundation program state aid as computed for the school district pursuant to \u00a7 13-13-72. However, the provisions of this section do not apply to any school district that receives no foundation program state aid distributed pursuant to chapter 13-13, and that is located at least twenty-five miles from the nearest high school in an adjoining school district in the state.
