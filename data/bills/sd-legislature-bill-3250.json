However, this grant of military jurisdiction shall neither preclude nor limit civilian jurisdiction over an offense, which is limited only by the prohibition of double jeopardy. Section 7. That chapter 33-10 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Courts-martial and courts of inquiry may be convened and held in units of the state military forces while those units are serving outside the state with the same jurisdiction and powers as to persons subject to this code as if the proceedings were held inside the state, and offenses committed outside the state may be tried and punished either inside or outside the state.

Section 127. That chapter 33-10 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: It is an affirmative defense in a trial by court-martial that, at the time of the commission of the acts constituting the offense, the accused, as a result of a severe mental disease or defect, was unable to appreciate the nature and quality or the wrongfulness of the acts. Mental disease or defect does not otherwise constitute a defense. Section 128. That chapter 33-10 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: The accused has the burden of proving the defense of lack of mental responsibility by clear and convincing evidence. Section 129. That chapter 33-10 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: If the lack of mental responsibility of the accused with respect to an offense is properly at issue, the military judge shall instruct the members of the court as to the defense of lack of mental responsibility under this section and charge them to find the accused: (1) Guilty; (2) Not guilty; or (3) Not guilty only by reason of lack of mental responsibility. Section 130. That chapter 33-10 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Section 129 of this Act does not apply to a court-martial composed of a military judge only.

Section 135. That chapter 33-10 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Sections 132 to 134, inclusive, of this Act, do not apply to a court-martial composed of a military judge only. The military judge of such a court-martial shall determine all questions of law and fact arising during the proceedings and, if the accused is convicted, adjudge an appropriate sentence. The military judge of such a court-martial shall make a general finding and shall in addition, on request, find the facts specially.

A tie vote on a challenge disqualifies the member challenged. A tie vote on a motion relating to the question of the accused's sanity is a determination against the accused. A tie vote on any other question is a determination in favor of the accused. Section 137. That chapter 33-10 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: A court-martial shall announce its findings and sentence to the parties as soon as determined. Section 138. That chapter 33-10 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Each general and special court-martial shall keep a separate record of the proceedings in each case brought before it, and the record shall be authenticated by the signature of the military judge.

That chapter 33-10 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: The punishment which a court-martial may direct for an offense may not exceed such limits as prescribed by this code, but in no instance may a sentence exceed more than ten years for a military offense, nor may a sentence of death be adjudged. A conviction by general court-martial of any military offense for which an accused may receive a sentence of confinement for more than one year is a felony offense. Except for convictions by a summary court-martial, all other military offenses are misdemeanors. Any conviction by a summary court-martial is not a criminal conviction. Section 144. That chapter 33-10 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: The limits of punishment for violations of the punitive provision prescribed by this code shall be lesser of the sentences prescribed by the manual for courts-martial of the United States in effect on January 1, 2012, and the state manual for courts-martial. However, in no instance may any punishment exceed that authorized by this code. Section 145. That chapter 33-10 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: If a sentence of a court-martial as lawfully adjudged and approved includes a forfeiture of pay or allowances in addition to confinement not suspended, the forfeiture may apply to pay or allowances becoming due on or after the date the sentence is approved by the convening authority. No forfeiture may extend to any pay or allowances accrued before that date. Section 146. That chapter 33-10 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Any period of confinement included in a sentence of a court-martial begins to run from the date the sentence is adjudged by the court-martial, but periods during which the sentence to confinement is suspended or deferred shall be excluded in computing the service of the term of confinement. All other sentences of courts-martial are effective on the date ordered executed. Section 147. That chapter 33-10 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: On application by an accused who is under sentence to confinement that has not been ordered executed, the convening authority or, if the accused is no longer under that person's jurisdiction, the person exercising general court-martial jurisdiction over the command to which the accused is currently assigned, may in that person's sole discretion defer service of the sentence to confinement. The deferment shall terminate when the sentence is ordered executed. The deferment may be rescinded at any time by the person who granted it or, if the accused is no longer under that person's jurisdiction, by the person exercising general court-martial jurisdiction over the command to which the accused is currently assigned. Section 148. That chapter 33-10 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: In any case in which a court-martial sentences an accused referred to in section 149 of this Act to confinement, the convening authority may defer the service of the sentence to confinement, without the consent of the accused, until after the accused has been permanently released to the state military forces by a state, the United States, or a foreign country referred to in that section. Section 149. That chapter 33-10 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Section 148 of this Act applies to a person subject to this code who: (1) While in the custody of a state, the United States, or a foreign country is temporarily returned by that state, the United States, or a foreign country to the state military forces for trial by court-martial; and (2) After the court-martial, is returned to that state, the United States, or a foreign country under the authority of a mutual agreement or treaty, as the case may be.

Section 151. That chapter 33-10 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: A sentence of confinement adjudged by a court-martial, whether or not the sentence includes discharge or dismissal, and whether or not the discharge or dismissal has been executed, may be carried into execution by confinement in any place authorized by this code. Any person so confined is subject to the same discipline and treatment as any person regularly confined or committed to that place of confinement. Section 152. That chapter 33-10 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: The omission of hard labor as a sentence authorized under this code does not deprive the state confinement facility from employing it, if it otherwise is within the authority of that facility to do so. Section 153. That chapter 33-10 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: No place of confinement may require payment of any fee or charge for so receiving or confining a person except as otherwise provided by law.

Section 155. That chapter 33-10 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: If the sentence of a member who is reduced in pay grade pursuant to subdivision (1) of section 154 of this Act is set aside or disapproved, or, as finally approved, does not include any punishment pursuant to subdivisions (1) or (2) of section 154 of this Act, the rights and privileges of which the person was deprived because of that reduction shall be restored, including pay and allowances. Section 156. That chapter 33-10 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: A court-martial sentence described in section 157 of this Act shall result in the forfeiture of pay, or of pay and allowances, due that member during any period of confinement or parole.

If the sentence approved after the first court-martial was in accordance with a pretrial agreement and the accused at the rehearing changes a plea with respect to the charges or specifications upon which the pretrial agreement was based, or otherwise does not comply with the pretrial agreement, the approved sentence as to those charges or specifications may include any punishment not in excess of that lawfully adjudged at the first court-martial.
