That chapter 22-40 be amended with a NEW SECTION: A person, business, or governmental agency that uses records containing personal information or protected information, as defined in \u00a7 22-40-19, shall take all reasonable steps to: (1) Secure and protect against unauthorized access to or use of the records until the entity is no longer required to retain the records; and (2) Destroy or arrange for the destruction of the records the entity is no longer required to retain by burning, pulverizing, crosscut shredding, erasing, or otherwise modifying the information contained in the records to make the information unreadable or indecipherable by any means. If a person, business, or governmental agency has engaged a third party business for the record destruction, the person, business, or governmental agency is not liable for the disposal of the records after the person, business, or governmental agency has relinquished control of the records to the third party for destruction. If a person, business, or governmental agency comes into possession of records containing personal information or protected information, the entity is immune from civil liability unless the entity fails to dispose of the records as required by this section. Following the discovery of records disposed of in a manner contrary to this section, the discoverer shall give notification to the Office of the Attorney General within ten business days if the records contain personal information or protected information for two hundred fifty individuals or more. A violation of this section is a deceptive act or practice as provided in \u00a7 37-24-6.
