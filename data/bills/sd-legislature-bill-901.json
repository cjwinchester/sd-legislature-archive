BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. The Legislature finds that Chapter 9 of the 2001 Session Laws, \"An Act to replace certain geographic place names that use offensive names, words, or phrases\", was enacted by the South Dakota Legislature in 2001. This legislation resulted in action by the United States Board on Geographic Names changing several offensive place names in 2008. However, several offensive place names identified in the 2001 legislation have not yet been changed, and the Legislature urges the United States Board on Geographic Names to proceed with further action on these place names. Section 2. That \u00a7 1-19C-1 be amended to read as follows: 1-19C-1. The Legislature finds that certain geographic place names are offensive and insulting to all South Dakota's people, history, and heritage. These place names should be replaced by names that reflect South Dakota's people, history, and heritage without resorting to harmful or offensive stereotypes, names, words, or phrases. Section 1-19C-4 lists Sections 7 and 8 of this Act list the currently known geographic names that are harmful or offensive. All state and local government agencies may shall make changes to maps and any other reference materials to reflect the changes provided in this chapter. A copy of this chapter shall be forwarded by the Legislative Research Council to the United States Board on Geographic Names for consideration as recommendations for changes on any federal maps and reference materials that reference these names and places.

The new place names provided in \u00a7 1-19C-4 sections 7 and 8 of this Act shall replace and shall be used by all state and local agencies in South Dakota in all future publications, maps, or other reference materials published after July 1, 2001 2009 . Section 4. That chapter 1-19C be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: The South Dakota Board on Geographic Names is hereby created.

The board shall elect a chair and vice chair from among its membership and shall meet at least once each year to consider issues related to geographical place names and to make recommendations to the appropriate local, state, and federal agencies. Section 5. That \u00a7 1-19C-3 be amended to read as follows: 1-19C-3. If no replacement place name for a specific location or feature is provided in \u00a7 1- 19C-4 section 8 of this Act , a replacement name may be suggested by the county or other local government entity, or by any interested person and may be submitted to the Department of Environment and Natural Resources in Pierre for a period of ninety days following July 1, 2001 South Dakota Board on Geographic Names . The final decision on any replacement names, not previously approved by the Legislature pursuant to this chapter, shall be made jointly by the Board of Water and Natural Resources, the Board of Minerals and Environment, and the Transportation Commission within sixty days after the expiration of the ninety-day deadline by the board. The board shall make its recommendations to the United States Board on Geographic Names concerning places specified in section 8 of this Act not later than January 1, 2010. The board shall make any subsequent recommendations in a timely manner . Any place names adopted in the manner described as provided in this section shall be adopted and used and shall replace the offensive place names listed in \u00a7 1-19C-4 sections 7 and 8 of this Act pursuant to the provisions of this chapter. Section 6. That \u00a7 1-19C-4 be repealed. 1-19C-4. Offensive place names in South Dakota by county are replaced as follows: Section 7. That chapter 1-19C be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: The following offensive place names in South Dakota by county were revised by the United States Board on Geographic Names as of January 1, 2009: Section 8. That chapter 1-19C be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: The following offensive place names in South Dakota by county have not been revised by the United States Board on Geographic Names as of January 1, 2009: Section 9.
