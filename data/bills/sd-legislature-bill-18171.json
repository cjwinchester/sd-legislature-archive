In the case of a bundled transaction of telecommunications services, if the charges are attributable to services that are taxable and services that are nontaxable, the portion of the price attributable to the nontaxable services shall be subject to tax unless the provider can reasonably identify such portion from its books and records kept in the regular course of business for other purposes. If the tax imposed by this section with respect to toll telephone service is paid by inserting coins in coin operated telephones, the tax shall be computed to the nearest multiple of five cents, except that, where the tax is midway between multiples of five cents, the next higher multiple shall apply.
