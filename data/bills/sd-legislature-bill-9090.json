WHEREAS, alcohol has been recognized as a Group 1 carcinogen and a direct cause of seven types of cancer by the American Cancer Society, the American Society of Clinical Oncology, the World Health Organization, the Centers for Disease Control, and cancer advocacy and awareness organizations throughout the world; and WHEREAS, the scientific community, cancer care organizations, and public health organizations recognize that even moderate consumption of alcohol can cause cancers; and WHEREAS, alcohol is proven to cause cancers of the mouth, throat (pharynx), voice box (larynx), esophagus, stomach, liver, colon and breast; and WHEREAS, it is estimated that, worldwide, about five percent of new cancers and six percent of cancer deaths each year are directly attributable to alcohol consumption; and WHEREAS, consuming even one alcoholic drink per day is linked with a five percent increase in the risk of breast cancer, a seventeen percent increase in the risk of oropharyngeal cancer (a cancer of the middle part of the throat), and a thirty percent increase in the risk of esophageal cancer, compared with not drinking; and WHEREAS, government responsibility for health information related to Group 1 cancer causing carcinogens has historically led to improved health outcomes related to other carcinogenic products such as asbestos and tobacco; and WHEREAS, consumers deserve to know if a product causes cancer or may adversely impact their health; and WHEREAS, women deserve to know that alcohol is among the leading indicators for breast cancer; and WHEREAS, just as prominent health warnings on tobacco are critical to reducing tobacco use and ensuring that smokers are adequately informed about the risks of smoking, prominent health warnings on alcohol products would benefit consumers of alcohol by educating about the impacts of alcohol and health; and WHEREAS, over seventy percent of Americans are not aware that alcohol causes cancer, according to a recent study by American Society of Clinical Oncology; and WHEREAS, prominent health warnings on packages are among the most cost-effective forms of public health education available: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the House of Representatives of the Ninety-Third Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the Senate concurring therein, that the South Dakota Legislature recognizes the importance of awareness of the link between alcohol and seven types of cancer and encourages the Department of Health to research potential awareness and prevention campaigns related to alcohol and cancer."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 9090, "action_date": "2018-02-01T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 48515, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/48515.pdf", "status_text": "First read and referred to", "journal_page": 281, "committee_id_action": 396, "committee_id_assigned": 387, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 9090, "action_date": "2018-02-02T13:30:00-06:00", "document_id": 48610, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/48610.pdf", "status_text": "Withdrawn at the Request of the Prime Sponsor", "journal_page": 314, "committee_id_action": 396, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/9090"}
