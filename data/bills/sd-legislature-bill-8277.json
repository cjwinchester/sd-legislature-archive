WHEREAS, farm and grazing lands are an extremely important resource for South Dakota at large; and WHEREAS, the expansion and protection of this resource is critical for South Dakota's future; and WHEREAS, the total acreage of land in farms is 43,257,079 and the state owns 0.6 percent of that land; and WHEREAS, since 1982, one hundred fifty-three thousand acres of farm and grazing land have been converted to developed lands; and WHEREAS, current average rates of return on agricultural land in South Dakota remain depressed; and WHEREAS, for 2016, the average ratio of gross cash rent to current land value was 2.7 percent for all agricultural land, 3.3 percent for cropland, 3.3 percent for hay land, and 2.4 percent for rangeland; and WHEREAS, during the 1990s, the same ratios were 7.4 percent for all agricultural land, 8.0 percent for cropland, and 6.8 percent for rangeland; and WHEREAS, since 2012, cash prices received for corn decreased approximately 52 percent, while farm-level soybean and wheat prices each decreased more than 40 percent; and WHEREAS, the decreases in crop prices and crop input prices have continued to pressure crop production margins and farm profitability; and WHEREAS, South Dakota crop farmers and ranchers have experienced declines in net farm income; and WHEREAS, decreasing availability of farmland and dwindling profitability deter young farmers from investing in the industry; and WHEREAS, farmers and ranchers must maximize productivity of available agricultural land; and WHEREAS, South Dakotans have noticed state highways and interstate highways have excessive setbacks in need of re-evaluation to ensure that South Dakotans are not unnecessarily deprived of the use of farm and grazing land; and WHEREAS, excessive highway setbacks squander crucial farm and grazing lands that farmers and ranchers could utilize; and WHEREAS, excessive highway setbacks adversely affect productivity of those who shoulder the majority of infrastructure costs of South Dakota through taxation; and WHEREAS, wasted farming and grazing land restricts South Dakota's tremendous economic potential; and WHEREAS, this harms the well-being of young South Dakota farmers and ranchers and South Dakota as a whole: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the House of Representatives of the Ninety-Second Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the Senate concurring therein, that the Legislature encourages the Department of Transportation to aggressively and thoroughly review all highway setbacks and make every effort to return any excess back to use by South Dakotans; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Legislature hereby recognizes as good stewards of the fertile plains which God blessed the beautiful state of South Dakota with, we must eternally scrutinize government retention of invaluable farm and ranch lands from the good people of South Dakota."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 8277, "action_date": "2017-02-23T13:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 44897, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/44897.pdf", "status_text": "First read and referred to", "journal_page": 495, "committee_id_action": 361, "committee_id_assigned": 356, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 8277, "action_date": "2017-02-27T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 44965, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/44965.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 356, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 8277, "action_date": "2017-02-27T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 45041, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/45041.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to the 41st legislative day", "journal_page": 544, "committee_id_action": 356, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 23744, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [1166, 1147, 1143, 1136, 1139, 1133, 1206, 1149, 1160, 1113, 1165, 1119], "Excused": [1179]}}]}
