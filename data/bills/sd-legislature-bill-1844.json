The board of township supervisors shall construct, repair, and maintain all of the secondary township roads within the township. The term, township road, means any section line road or other road designated by resolution of the board as being on the township road system. The board shall, at its annual meeting, designate which secondary township roads are full maintenance roads and which are minimum maintenance roads. The board of township supervisors shall publish any resolution designating a secondary township road as minimum maintenance if such the road is a school route. The designation shall be final, after a lapse of thirty days, unless appealed as provided in chapter 31-3. Following its annual meeting, the board shall submit to the county auditor an official map showing each road on the township road system, including any road designated as a minimum maintenance road.
