That \u00a7 51A-17-6 be REPEALED: Each licensee under this chapter shall maintain at all times a tangible net worth of the greater of one hundred thousand dollars or three percent of total assets for the first one hundred million dollars, two percent of additional assets from one hundred million dollars to one billion dollars, and one-half of one percent of additional assets over one billion dollars. Tangible net worth must be demonstrated in an initial application by the applicant's most recent audited financial statement pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 51A-17-13(8) and 51A-17-14(5). The director has the authority to exempt, in whole or in part, any applicant or licensee from the requirements of this section for good cause. Section 83. That \u00a7 51A-17-7 be REPEALED: Every corporate applicant, at the time of filing of an application for a license under this chapter and at all times after a license is issued, shall be in good standing in the state of its incorporation. All noncorporate applicants shall, at the time of the filing of an application for a license under this chapter and at all times after a license is issued, be registered or qualified to do business in the state. Section 84. That \u00a7 51A-17-8 be REPEALED: Each application shall be accompanied by a security device acceptable to the director in the amount of one hundred thousand dollars. The director may increase the amount of the security device to a maximum of five hundred thousand dollars upon the basis of the impaired financial condition of a licensee, as evidenced by a reduction in net worth, financial losses, or other relevant criteria. The security device shall be in a form satisfactory to the director and shall run to the state for the benefit of any claimants against the licensee to secure the faithful performance of the obligations of the licensee with respect to the receipt, handling, transmission, and payment of money in connection with the sale and issuance of payment instruments or the transmission of money, or both. In the case of a surety bond, the aggregate liability of the surety may not exceed the principal sum of the bond. Any claimant against the licensee may bring suit directly on the security device or the director may bring suit on behalf of any claimant, either in one action or in successive actions. In lieu of a security device or of any portion of the principal thereof, as required by this section, the licensee may deposit with the director, or with such banks in this state as the licensee may designate and the director may approve, cash, interest-bearing stocks and bonds, notes, debentures, or other obligations of the United States or any agency or instrumentality thereof, or guaranteed by the United States, or of this state, or of a city, county, school district, or instrumentality of this state, or guaranteed by this state, to an aggregate amount, based upon principal amount or market value, whichever is lower, of not less than the amount of the security device or portion thereof. The securities or cash shall be deposited as provided in this section and held to secure the same obligations as would the security device, but the depositor is entitled to receive all interest and dividends thereon, has the right, with the approval of the director, to substitute other securities for those deposited, and shall be required so to do on written order of the director made for good cause shown. No security device may be cancelled without thirty days' written notice to the director. Cancellation does not affect any liability incurred or accrued during the period the security device was in effect. Section 85. That \u00a7 51A-17-9 be REPEALED: The security device shall remain in place for five years after the licensee ceases money transmission operations in the state. However, the director may permit the security device to be reduced or eliminated prior to that time to the extent that the amount of the licensee's payment instruments outstanding in this state are reduced. The director may also permit a licensee to substitute a letter of credit or other form of security device acceptable to the director for the security device in place at the time the licensee ceases money transmission operations in the state. Section 86. That \u00a7 51A-17-10 be REPEALED: A licensee shall maintain at all times permissible investments that have a market value computed in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles of not less than the aggregate amount of all of its outstanding money transmission obligations. Except for permissible investments enumerated in \u00a7 51A-17-2, the director, with respect to any licensee, may limit the extent to which a specific investment maintained by a licensee within a class of permissible investments may be considered a permissible investment, if the specific investment represents undue risk to customers, not reflected in the market value of investments. Permissible investments, as provided in \u00a7 51A-17-2, even if commingled with other assets of the licensee, are held in trust for the benefit of the purchasers and holders of the licensee's outstanding money transmission obligations in the event of insolvency, the filing of a petition by or against the licensee under the United States Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 101 to 110, as of January 1, 2023, for bankruptcy or reorganization, the filing of a petition by or against the licensee for receivership, the commencement of any other judicial or administrative proceeding for its dissolution or reorganization, or in the event of an action by a creditor against the licensee who is not a beneficiary of this statutory trust. No permissible investments impressed with a trust pursuant to this section shall be subject to attachment, levy of execution, or sequestration by order of any court, except for a beneficiary of this statutory trust. Section 87. That \u00a7 51A-17-10.1 be REPEALED: Upon the establishment of a statutory trust in accordance with \u00a7 51A-17-10, or when any funds are drawn on a letter of credit pursuant to this section, the director shall notify the applicable regulator of each state in which the licensee is licensed to engage in money transmission, if any, of the establishment of the trust or the funds drawn on the letter of credit, as applicable. Notice is satisfied if performed pursuant to a multistate agreement or through the Nationwide Multistate Licensing System. Funds drawn on a letter of credit and any other permissible investments held in trust for the benefit of the purchasers and holders of the licensee's outstanding money transmission obligations, are deemed held in trust for the benefit of such purchasers and holders on a pro rata and equitable basis in accordance with statutes pursuant to which permissible investments are required to be held in this state and other states. Any statutory trust established under this section shall be terminated upon extinguishment of all of the licensee's outstanding money transmission obligations. Section 88. That \u00a7 51A-17-10.2 be REPEALED: The director may allow other types of investments that the director determines are of sufficient liquidity and quality to be a permissible investment. The director is authorized to participate in efforts with other state regulators to determine that other types of investments are of sufficient liquidity and quality to be a permissible investment. Section 89. That \u00a7 51A-17-10.3 be REPEALED: A licensee transmitting virtual currencies shall hold like-kind virtual currencies of the same volume as that held by the licensee but that is obligated to consumers, in lieu of the permissible investments otherwise required in this section.

The division may require a state and federal criminal history background check for any licensee who is the subject of a disciplinary investigation by the division. The failure to submit or cooperate with the criminal history background check under this section may result in denial of an application or revocation of a license. The applicant shall pay for any fees charged for the cost of fingerprinting or the criminal history background check. Section 91. That \u00a7 51A-17-12 be REPEALED: Each application for a license under this chapter shall be made in writing on a form prescribed by the director that includes: (1) The exact name of the applicant, the applicant's principal address, any fictitious or trade name used by the applicant in the conduct of business, and the location of the applicant's business records; (2) The history of the applicant's material litigation for the preceding five-year period; (3) A complete set of the applicant's fingerprints and a signed waiver authorizing the division to conduct a criminal history background check of the applicant; (4) A description of the business activities conducted by the applicant and a history of operations; (5) A description of the business activities in which the applicant seeks to be engaged in the state; (6) A list identifying the applicant's proposed authorized delegates in the state, if any, at the time of the filing of the application; (7) A sample authorized delegate contract, if applicable; (8) A sample form of payment instrument, if applicable; (9) Each location at which the applicant and its authorized delegates, if any, propose to conduct the licensed activities in the state; and (10) The name and address of the clearing bank or banks on which the applicant's payment instruments will be drawn or through which the payment instruments will be payable.

If South Dakota is the lead investigative state, the director is authorized and encouraged to investigate the applicant pursuant to \u00a7 51A-17-23 and the timeframes established by agreement through the multistate licensing process. Section 105. That \u00a7 51A-17-23 be REPEALED: A licensee shall electronically file an advance change notice through the nationwide mortgage licensing system and registry of a proposed change of control within fifteen days after learning of the proposed change of control and request approval of the acquisition.

An authorized delegate may apply for relief from a suspension or revocation of designation as an authorized delegate pursuant to chapter 1-26. Section 119. That \u00a7 51A-17-37 be REPEALED: If the director determines that a violation of this chapter or of a rule adopted or an order issued pursuant to this chapter by a licensee or authorized delegate is likely to cause immediate and irreparable harm to the licensee, its customers, or the public as a result of the violation, or cause insolvency or significant dissipation of assets of the licensee, the director may issue an order requiring the licensee or authorized delegate to cease and desist from the violation. The director may issue an order against a licensee to cease and desist from providing money transmission services through an authorized delegate that is the subject of a separate order pursuant to \u00a7 51A-17-36.

However, the director may permit the security device to be reduced or eliminated prior to that time to the extent that the amount of the licensee's payment instruments outstanding in this state are reduced. The director may also permit a licensee to substitute a letter of credit or other form of security device acceptable to the director for the security device in place at the time the licensee ceases money transmission operations in the state. Section 89. That \u00a7 51A-17-10 be REPEALED: A licensee shall maintain at all times permissible investments that have a market value computed in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles of not less than the aggregate amount of all of its outstanding money transmission obligations. Except for permissible investments enumerated in \u00a7 51A-17-2, the director, with respect to any licensee, may limit the extent to which a specific investment maintained by a licensee within a class of permissible investments may be considered a permissible investment, if the specific investment represents undue risk to customers, not reflected in the market value of investments.

Notice is satisfied if performed pursuant to a multistate agreement or through the Nationwide Multistate Licensing System. Funds drawn on a letter of credit and any other permissible investments held in trust for the benefit of the purchasers and holders of the licensee's outstanding money transmission obligations, are deemed held in trust for the benefit of such purchasers and holders on a pro rata and equitable basis in accordance with statutes pursuant to which permissible investments are required to be held in this state and other states.

The director may: (1) Conduct an examination either on-site or off-site; (2) Conduct an examination in conjunction with an examination conducted by representatives of another state agency, an agency of another state, or the federal government; (3) Accept the examination report of another state agency, agency of another state, or the federal government, or a report prepared by an independent accounting firm.

A licensee or authorized delegate shall provide, and the director must have full and complete access to, all records the director may reasonably require to conduct a complete examination. The records must be provided at the location and in the format specified by the director. The director may utilize multistate record production standards and examination procedures when the standards will reasonably achieve the requirements of this section. Unless otherwise directed by the director, a licensee shall pay all costs reasonably incurred in connection with an examination of the licensee or the licensee's authorized delegates. Section 113. That \u00a7 51A-17-28 be REPEALED: The director may request financial data from a licensee in addition to that required under \u00a7 51A-17-19, or conduct an examination of any authorized delegate or location of a licensee within this state without prior notice to the authorized delegate or licensee only if the director has a reasonable basis to believe that the licensee or authorized delegate is in noncompliance with this chapter. If the director examines an authorized delegate's operations, the authorized delegate shall pay all reasonably incurred costs of such examination. If the director examines a licensee's location within the state, the licensee shall pay all reasonably incurred costs of such examination. Section 114. That \u00a7 51A-17-29 be REPEALED: Each licensee shall make, keep, and preserve the following books, accounts, and other records for a period of three years and which shall be open to inspection by the director: (1) A record or records of each payment instrument and stored value sold; (2) A general ledger, which general ledger shall be posted at least monthly, containing all assets, liabilities, capital, income, and expense accounts; (3) Bank statements and bank reconciliation records; (4) Records of outstanding payment instruments and stored value; (5) Records of each payment instrument and stored value paid within the three-year period; (6) A list of the names and addresses of all of the licensee's authorized delegates; and (7) Any other records the director reasonably requires by rule promulgated pursuant to chapter 1-26. Maintenance of such documents as are required by this section in a photographic, electronic, or other similar form constitutes compliance with this section.

That \u00a7 51A-17-30 be REPEALED: All information or reports obtained by the director from an applicant, licensee, or authorized delegate, whether obtained through reports, applications, examination, audits, investigation, or otherwise, including all information contained in or related to examination, investigation, operating, or condition reports prepared by, on behalf of, or for the use of the director, or financial statements, balance sheets, or authorized delegate information, are confidential. However, the director may disclose confidential information to officials and examiners of other state or federal regulatory authorities or to appropriate prosecuting attorneys. This section does not prohibit the director from disclosing to the public a list of persons licensed under this chapter or the aggregated financial data on those licensees. Section 116. That \u00a7 51A-17-31 be REPEALED: Any licensee desiring to conduct licensed activities through an authorized delegate shall authorize each delegate to operate pursuant to an express written contract. Any such contract entered into after July 1, 2008, shall provide the following: (1) That the licensee appoints the person as its delegate with authority to engage in money transmission on behalf of the licensee; (2) That neither a licensee nor an authorized delegate may authorize subdelegates without the written consent of the director; and (3) That licensees are subject to supervision and regulation by the director. Section 117. That \u00a7 51A-17-32 be REPEALED: An authorized delegate shall adhere to the following standards of conduct: (1) No authorized delegate may make any fraudulent or false statement or misrepresentation to a licensee or to the director; (2) All money transmission or sale or issuance of payment instrument activities conducted by an authorized delegate shall be strictly in accordance with the licensee's written procedures provided to the authorized delegate; (3) An authorized delegate shall remit all money owing to the licensee in accordance with the terms of the contract between the licensee and the authorized delegate. The failure of an authorized delegate to remit all money owing to a licensee within the time presented shall result in liability of the authorized delegate to the licensee for the licensee's actual damages. The director may establish, by rules promulgated pursuant to chapter 1-26, the maximum remittance time; (4) An authorized delegate is deemed to consent to the director's inspection, with or without prior notice to the licensee or authorized delegate, of the books and records of authorized delegates of the licensee if the director has a reasonable basis to believe that the licensee or authorized delegate is in noncompliance with this chapter; and (5) An authorized delegate is under a duty to act only as authorized under the contract with the licensee. An authorized delegate who exceeds the authority grant under the contract is subject to cancellation of the contract and further disciplinary action by the director. Section 118. That \u00a7 51A-17-33 be REPEALED: Any funds, less fees, received by an authorized delegate of a licensee from the sale or delivery of a payment instrument issued by a licensee or received by an authorized delegate for transmission shall, from the time such funds are received by such authorized delegate until such time when the funds or an equivalent amount are remitted by the authorized delegate to the licensee, constitute trust funds owned by and belonging to the licensee. If an authorized delegate commingles any such funds with any other funds or property owned or controlled by the authorized delegate, any commingled proceeds and other property shall be impressed with a trust in favor of the licensee in an amount equal to the amount of the proceeds due the licensee. Section 119. That \u00a7 51A-17-34 be REPEALED: An authorized delegate shall report to the licensee the theft or loss of payment instruments and stored value within twenty-four hours from the time the authorized delegate knew or should have known of such theft or loss. Section 120. That \u00a7 51A-17-35 be REPEALED: The director may suspend or revoke a licensee's license if the director finds that: (1) Any fact or condition exists that, if it had existed at the time when the licensee applied for its license, would have been grounds for denying such application; (2) The licensee's net worth becomes inadequate and the licensee, after ten days written notice from the director, fails to take such steps as the director deems necessary to remedy such deficiency; (3) The licensee violates any material provision of this chapter or any rule or order promulgated by the director under authority of this chapter; (4) The licensee is convicted of a violation of a state or federal anti-money laundering statute or is subject to an enforcement action for a violation of a state or federal anti-money laundering statute; (5) The licensee is conducting its business in an unsafe or unsound manner; (6) The licensee is insolvent; (7) The licensee has suspended payment of its obligations, has made an assignment for the benefit of its creditors, or has admitted in writing its inability to pay its debts as they become due; (8) The licensee has applied for an adjudication of bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, or other relief under any bankruptcy; (9) The licensee refuses to permit the director to make any examination authorized by this chapter; (10) The licensee fails to make any report required by this chapter; or (11) The competence, experience, character, or general fitness of the licensee indicates that it is not in the public interest to permit the licensee to conduct its business. Section 121. That \u00a7 51A-17-36 be REPEALED: The director may issue an order suspending or revoking the designation of an authorized delegate, if the director finds that: (1) The authorized delegate violated this chapter or a rule adopted or an order issued under this chapter; (2) The authorized delegate did not cooperate with an examination or investigation by the director; (3) The authorized delegate engages in fraud, intentional misrepresentation, or gross negligence; (4) The authorized delegate is convicted of a violation of a state or federal anti-money laundering statute or is subject to an enforcement action for a violation of a state or federal anti-money laundering statute; (5) The competence, experience, character, or general fitness of the authorized delegate or a person in control of the authorized delegate indicates that it is not in the public interest to permit the authorized delegate to provide money services; or (6) The authorized delegate is engaging in an unsafe or unsound practice. In determining whether an authorized delegate is engaging in an unsafe or unsound practice, the director may consider the size and condition of the authorized delegate's provision of money services, the magnitude of the loss, the gravity of the violation of this chapter, and the previous conduct of the authorized delegate. An authorized delegate may apply for relief from a suspension or revocation of designation as an authorized delegate pursuant to chapter 1-26. Section 122. That \u00a7 51A-17-37 be REPEALED: If the director determines that a violation of this chapter or of a rule adopted or an order issued pursuant to this chapter by a licensee or authorized delegate is likely to cause immediate and irreparable harm to the licensee, its customers, or the public as a result of the violation, or cause insolvency or significant dissipation of assets of the licensee, the director may issue an order requiring the licensee or authorized delegate to cease and desist from the violation. The director may issue an order against a licensee to cease and desist from providing money transmission services through an authorized delegate that is the subject of a separate order pursuant to \u00a7 51A-17-36. The order becomes effective upon service of it upon the licensee or authorized delegate. An order to cease and desist remains effective and enforceable pending the completion of an administrative proceeding pursuant to chapter 1-26. However, a licensee or an authorized delegate that is served with an order to cease and desist may petition the circuit court for a judicial order setting aside, limiting, or suspending the enforcement, operation, or effectiveness of the order pending the completion of an administrative proceeding pursuant to chapter 1-26. Section 123. That \u00a7 51A-17-38 be REPEALED: The director shall commence an administrative proceeding pursuant to chapter 1-26 within twenty days after issuing an order to cease and desist.

That \u00a7 51A-17-39 be REPEALED: The director may enter into a consent order at any time with a person to resolve a matter arising under this chapter. A consent order shall be signed by the person to whom it is issued or by the person's authorized representative, and shall indicate agreement with the terms contained in the order. A consent order may provide that it does not constitute an admission by a person that this chapter or a rule adopted or an order issued under this chapter has been violated. Section 125. That \u00a7 51A-17-40 be REPEALED: The director may assess a fine against a person that violates this chapter or a rule adopted or an order issued under this chapter in an amount not to exceed five hundred dollars per day for each day the violation is outstanding, plus the state's costs and expenses for the investigation and prosecution of the matter, including reasonable attorney's fees. Section 126. That \u00a7 51A-17-41 be REPEALED: Any person that intentionally makes a false statement, misrepresentation, or false certification in a record filed or required to be maintained under this chapter or that intentionally makes a false entry or omits a material entry in such a record is guilty of a Class 6 felony. Any person that knowingly engages in any activity for which a license is required under this chapter without being licensed under this chapter is guilty of a Class 6 felony. Section 127. That \u00a7 51A-17-42 be REPEALED: If the director has reason to believe that a person has violated or is violating \u00a7 51A-17-4, the director may issue an order to show cause why an order to cease and desist should not issue requiring that the person cease and desist from the violation of \u00a7 51A-17-4. In an emergency, the director may petition the circuit court for the issuance of a temporary restraining order. An order to cease and desist becomes effective upon service of it upon the person. An order to cease and desist remains effective and enforceable pending the completion of an administrative proceeding pursuant to chapter 1-26. A person that is served with an order to cease and desist for violating \u00a7 51A-17-4 may petition the circuit court for a judicial order setting aside, limiting, or suspending the enforcement, operation, or effectiveness of the order pending the completion of an administrative proceeding pursuant to chapter 1-26. The director shall commence an administrative proceeding within twenty days after issuing an order to cease and desist. Section 128. That \u00a7 51A-17-43 be REPEALED: Any person who engages in business activity regulated by this chapter is deemed to have consented to the jurisdiction of the courts of South Dakota for all actions arising under this chapter. Section 129. That \u00a7 51A-17-45 be REPEALED: No license granted pursuant to this chapter is assignable. Section 130. That \u00a7 51A-17-46 be REPEALED: Any money coming into the custody of the division pursuant to this chapter shall be deposited with the state treasurer. The state treasurer shall credit the money to the banking special revenue fund. Any expenditure of money out of the fund may only be made by appropriation by the Legislature through either the General Appropriation Act or a special appropriation bill. The director shall approve vouchers and the state auditor shall draw warrants to pay expenditures authorized by this chapter. Section 131. That \u00a7 51A-17-47 be REPEALED: The director may promulgate rules pursuant to chapter 1-26 to establish the process for conducting background investigations, for the conduct of examinations, the reporting of information required by this chapter, and the process for the suspension or revocation of a license issued by the division.

The information and material may be shared with a state or federal regulatory official who has money transmission industry oversight authority without the loss of privilege or the loss of confidentiality protections by federal law or \u00a7 51A-17-30; and (2) No information or material that is subject to privilege or confidentiality pursuant to this section is subject to: (a) Disclosure under any federal or state law governing the disclosure to the public of information held by an officer or an agency of the federal government or the respective state; or (b) Subpoena or discovery, or admission into evidence, in any private civil action or administrative process, unless with respect to any privilege held by the nationwide mortgage licensing system and registry regarding the information or material is waived, in whole or in part, by the person to whom the information or material pertains. This section does not apply to the information or material relating to the employment history of, and publicly adjudicated disciplinary and enforcement actions against, money transmitters that is included in the nationwide mortgage licensing system and registry for access by the public.

A joint examination or investigation, or acceptance of an examination or investigation report, does not constitute a waiver of an examination assessment provided for in this chapter."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 24779, "action_date": "2024-01-09T12:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 257007, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/257007.pdf", "status_text": "First read in Senate and referred to", "journal_page": 17, "committee_id_action": 1219, "committee_id_assigned": 1209, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 24779, "action_date": "2024-01-23T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 260621, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/260621.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 1209, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 24779, "action_date": "2024-01-30T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 262930, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/262930.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 1, "committee_id_action": 1209, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 24779, "action_date": "2024-01-30T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 262935, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/262935.pdf", "status_text": "Motion to amend", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 1209, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 24779, "action_date": "2024-01-30T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 262935, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/262935.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass Amended", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 1209, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 78974, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [4487, 4507, 4517, 4536, 4558, 4564, 4477, 4572], "Excused": [4512]}}]}
