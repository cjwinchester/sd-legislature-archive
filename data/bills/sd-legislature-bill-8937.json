BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 12-6-26 be amended to read: 12-6-26. No person may vote a party ballot at any primary election, unless the person is registered as a member of that political party in the precinct in which the person seeks to vote, or, in the case of a person with no party affiliation or independent, a person may specify on the person's voter registration form the party primary in which the person chooses to participate. Any political party in its constitution or bylaws may allow for participation in the party's primary elections by any person who is registered to vote with no party affiliation. Any such change to the constitution or bylaws of a political party shall be filed pursuant to \u00a7 12-5-1.1 by January first of the year in the which the primary is conducted. Section 2. That chapter 12-6 be amended by adding a NEW SECTION to read: At the time of registration any person selecting no party affiliation or independent party shall be given a separate column to choose which party's primary he or she chooses to participate. Any voters choosing no party affiliation or independent shall be allowed to choose to vote in the primary of one registered political party. If any voter choosing no party affiliation or independent does not indicate a choice of primary on his or her voter registration, the ballot shall default to a non-political ballot, if available. If party loses its registered status, the ballot for any voter, who chose no party affiliation or independent voter and who listed that party on his or her voter registration, shall default to a non-political ballot. Section 3. That \u00a7 12-19-2.6 be repealed. 12-19-2.6. If an absentee voter in a primary election is registered as an independent and is eligible to vote more than one ballot style pursuant to \u00a7 12-6-26, the voter may specify the voter's ballot style preference on the absentee ballot application. If no ballot style is designated, the absentee voter shall be provided a nonpolitical ballot. If an absentee voter in a primary election is registered as an independent and is only eligible to vote one ballot style, the absentee voter shall be provided that ballot style. If more than one party allows independent voters to be eligible to vote in a primary election and no nonpolitical ballot is available and the absentee voter does not designate the ballot style to be received, no ballot may be provided to the absentee voter."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 8937, "action_date": "2018-02-01T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 48515, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/48515.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 288, "committee_id_action": 396, "committee_id_assigned": 391, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 8937, "action_date": "2018-02-07T15:30:00-06:00", "document_id": 48679, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/48679.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 391, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 8937, "action_date": "2018-02-07T15:30:00-06:00", "document_id": 48911, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/48911.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass", "journal_page": 386, "committee_id_action": 391, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 25544, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [1268, 1284, 1282, 1238, 1250, 1226, 1253, 1277, 1259, 1225], "Nay": [1283, 1248], "Excused": [1240]}}, {"bill_id": 8937, "action_date": "2018-02-12T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 49084, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/49084.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass", "journal_page": 409, "committee_id_action": 396, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "F", "vote": {"vote_id": 25672, "president_vote": null, "Excused": [1313, 1266, 1293, 1254], "Nay": [1241, 1269, 1297, 1424, 1284, 1214, 1223, 1307, 1301, 1260, 1308, 1312, 1291, 1275, 1283, 1314, 1222, 1302, 1306, 1265, 1247, 1316, 1248, 1280, 1295, 1303, 1309, 1259, 1225, 1256, 1261, 1287, 1236, 1215, 1216, 1298, 1285], "Yea": [1213, 1268, 1279, 1235, 1294, 1425, 1282, 1311, 1238, 1250, 1286, 1315, 1296, 1292, 1310, 1226, 1263, 1274, 1249, 1277, 1255, 1299, 1240, 1258, 1305, 1257, 1317, 1229, 1253]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/8937"}
