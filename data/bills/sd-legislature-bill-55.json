BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 46A-10A-30 be amended to read as follows: 46A-10A-30. Any board or commission under the provisions of this chapter and chapter 46A-11 may adopt a permit system for drainage. The permit system shall be prospective in nature and shall consider information required in a drainage permit application as provided in section 2 of this Act . Permits shall be granted consistent with the principles outlined in \u00a7 46A-10A-20. The fee for a permit shall be established by the permitting authority, based on the administrative costs of regulating drainage activities, may not exceed one hundred dollars, and shall be paid only once. However, permitted drainage that is enlarged, rerouted, or otherwise modified requires a new permit. Any vested drainage right not recorded under the provisions of \u00a7 46A-10A-31 requires a permit for its use if a permit system has been established in the county where it exists. Any person or the person's contractor draining water without a permit, if a permit is required under the provisions of this section, is guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor. In addition to or in lieu of any criminal penalty, a court may assess against any person violating the provisions of this section a civil penalty not to exceed one thousand dollars per each day of violation. A permit system is an official control. Section 2. That chapter 46A-10A be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Any application for a drainage permit submitted to a county pursuant to \u00a7 46A-10A-30 shall include a detailed drawing or analysis showing both the elevation and profile of the proposed construction as well as a description of the impact to other property owners of the proposed drainage and requirements for notification of affected property owners. The application shall also include the following information as determined by a professional engineer registered in the State of South Dakota: (1) General description of the proposed drainage project and whether it involves new drain or tile or the repair of existing drain or tile; (2) Name, address, and telephone numbers of primary applicant; owner of the land to be drained or tiled; and owner of land where system outlets are located; (3) Detailed map or drawing showing the site plan and location of facilities; (4) Legal description of land to be drained or tiled; (5) Legal description or location of outlet; (6) Description of outlet (gravity, pump, other) and whether the outlet is gated; (7) Design capacity of the drainage or tile system and outlet flow capacity; (8) Acres of land to be drained or tiled; (9) Description of area where the drainage or tile system will discharge (road ditch, private drain, assessment drain, natural waterway, other); (10) Name and address of drainage contractor who will construct the project; (11) Estimated construction start and completion dates; (12) Public property that could be affected by the proposed project and notification or approval by affected state, federal, or local government agencies; (13) Whether a wetlands determination by the federal Natural Resources Conservation Service has been completed for the property to be drained; and (14) Other information required by the county."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 55, "action_date": "2013-01-23T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 24441, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/24441.pdf", "status_text": "First read in Senate and referred to", "journal_page": 178, "committee_id_action": 200, "committee_id_assigned": 183, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 55, "action_date": "2013-01-30T08:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 24731, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/24731.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 183, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 55, "action_date": "2013-02-06T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 25230, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/25230.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 183, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 55, "action_date": "2013-02-13T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 25498, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/25498.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 183, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 55, "action_date": "2013-02-13T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 25621, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/25621.pdf", "status_text": "Motion to amend", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 183, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 55, "action_date": "2013-02-13T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 25621, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/25621.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to the 41st legislative day", "journal_page": 388, "committee_id_action": 183, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 13702, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [363], "Yea": [325, 336, 345, 386, 339, 383]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/55"}
