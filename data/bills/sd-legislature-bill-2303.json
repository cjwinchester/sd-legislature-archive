BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 10-21-15 be repealed. 10-21-15. The county treasurer in collecting taxes shall collect the oldest tax first, and may not issue a receipt for the current year until all prior taxes are paid. The existence of a tax receipt issued by the county treasurer is conclusive evidence that all prior taxes which are chargeable against the property described in the receipt have been fully paid and constitutes a bar to the collection of any prior taxes on the property, unless otherwise stated in the receipt. Such statement in the receipt shall specifically identify the tax, which is not to be barred by the receipt. Section 2. That \u00a7 10-21-1.1 be amended to read as follows: 10-21-1.1. The county treasurer shall send a written tax bill to each taxpayer against whom a property tax has been assessed. Property tax bills sent to taxpayers may reflect the breakdown of the tax by tax levies. The property tax bill shall also separately state the amount of any taxes due as a result of a local decision to exceed the tax increase limits set forth in \u00a7 10-13-36 or 10-12-43 and shall be marked by an asterisk. The notice shall include the statement: \"INDICATES A LOCAL DECISION TO OPT OUT OF THE TAX LIMITATION.\" If the local vote to increase taxes had not passed, your taxes would not have included the items marked with an asterisk (*). If the treasurer does not mail the property tax receipts described in \u00a7\u00a7 10-21-14 and 10-21-15, the treasurer shall indicate in the property tax bill or a notice enclosed with the bill that the treasurer does not intend to send a receipt unless requested by the taxpayer. The county treasurer shall provide to a taxpayer a tax levy sheet, if the tax levy breakdown is not shown on the tax bill, or upon the taxpayer's request. The annual levy sheet shall contain an example of the computation of the total tax for an individual. The secretary of revenue and regulation shall prescribe a uniform form which shall be used by the county treasurer for notification of taxpayers as required by this section."}, {"bill_id": 2303,
