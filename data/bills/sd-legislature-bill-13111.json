The cost so computed shall be apportioned between the parents on the basis of income or income imputed as provided in \u00a7 \u00a7 25-7-6.1 to 25-7-6.17, inclusive. If one parent pays the entire amount, he that parent shall either be reimbursed by the other parent for the other that parent's portion of the payment , or shall receive a credit against his or her support obligation, whichever is appropriate.

However, an existing support order may not be modified solely for this reason; or (10) The voluntary act of either parent which reduces that parent's income. Section 4.

The cost so computed shall be apportioned between the parents on the basis of income or income imputed as provided in \u00a7 \u00a7 25-7-6.1 to 25-7-6.17, inclusive. If one parent pays the entire amount, he that parent shall either be reimbursed by the other parent for the other that parent's portion of the payment , or shall receive a credit against his or her support obligation, whichever is appropriate. Any additional, reasonable medical costs , including optometric, dental or orthodontic, counseling or other health care costs for each minor child which exceed two hundred fifty dollars in any year and are not covered by insurance , shall be apportioned between the parents in proportion to the support obligation of each parent. Section 10. That chapter 25-7 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Notwithstanding the provisions of \u00a7 25-7A-17 or \u00a7 25-7-7.3, if, by agreement of the parties, the obligor had primary physical custody of the child for more than four consecutive months, the court may credit the obligor for child support arrearages which accumulated during the period the obligor had actual physical custody of the child.
