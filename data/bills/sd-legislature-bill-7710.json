The notice required by this section shall be presumed to be received by the adverse possessor ten days from the date of mailing. Section 2. That chapter 15-3 be amended by adding a NEW SECTION to read: If the adverse possessor's address cannot be determined by reasonable inquiry, a notice stating the name of adverse possessor, a description of the land under which the substantial inclosure is located, and the name of the record owner giving notice shall be published in each official newspaper of the county. The publication shall be made once every three weeks. Section 3. That chapter 15-3 be amended by adding a NEW SECTION to read: Failure to remove the substantial inclosure within the time period provided in chapter 15-3 does not cause right of title to be extinguished, if the record owner meets the requirements of section 2 of this Act. Section 4. That chapter 15-3 be amended by adding a NEW SECTION to read: No later than thirty days after the issuance of notice, the record owner may elect to have the claim asserted in an action to quiet the title to the real property pursuant to chapter 21-41. In an action in any court of this state in which the title or right of possession to any possessed property is in dispute, the court shall, upon application of any of the parties to the suit, enter an order for a survey of the part of the property in dispute to determine the boundary. Section 5. That chapter 15-3 be amended by adding a NEW SECTION to read: This Act does not apply to any fence surrounding public property or a fixed structure.
