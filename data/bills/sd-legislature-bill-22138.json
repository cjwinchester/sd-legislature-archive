Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of South Dakota: Section 1. Legislative Findings. The Legislature finds that: (1) There is no statutory authorization for the sex designation on a birth certificate to be amended based upon the person's subjective identification of sex, when that identification is inconsistent with the person's objective, biological sex; (2) Orders have been entered by circuit courts in this state, in the cases of adults and children, directing that the sex designation on a person's birth certificate be changed from male to female, or female to male, based upon the person's subjective identification of sex, when that identification is inconsistent with the person's objective, biological sex; (3) In at least one pending case, a circuit court has been asked to change the sex designation on the petitioner's birth certificate from female to nonbinary; (4) Upon receipt of a court order, the Office of Vital Records, Department of Health, changes the sex designation on a person's birth certificate from male to female, or female to male, based upon the person's subjective identification of sex, when that identification is inconsistent with the person's objective, biological sex; (5) Section 44:09:05:02 of the Administrative Rules of South Dakota, promulgated by the Department of Health, authorizes the amendment of birth certificates when an order of a court of competent jurisdiction directs that the certificate be amended, includes the incorrect data as stated on the certificate, and includes the corrected data as such should appear; (6) A representative of the American Civil Liberties Union of South Dakota stated in a legal clinic conducted on May 22, 2020, \"The definition of incorrect data is not provided . . . . The Office of Vital Records is considering a person who has transitioned to a different gender or sex to satisfy this requirement. In other words, if I started as female and I have now transitioned into male, that is incorrect data and it will satisfy that requirement . . . [and the Department of Health] currently believes that a person who has transitioned to a different gender or sex does satisfy the incorrect data requirement.\"; (7) Information provided to the court by the Department of Health regarding what constitutes incorrect data has caused courts to hold that \"the Department of Health understands that the term 'incorrect data' can mean any item on a record which is incorrect, including sex\"; (8) A sex designation on a birth certificate is not incorrect, if the designation accurately reflects the biological sex of the person as male or female; (9) A person's subjective identification of sex, if inconsistent with the person's objective, biological sex, does not change the person's sex; (10) According to the Office of Research on Women's Health, National Institutes of Health, \"[s]ex refers to biological differences between females and males, including chromosomes, sex organs, and endogenous hormonal profiles\"; (11) According to the World Health Organization, \"[s]ex refers to the biological characteristics that define humans as female or male\"; (12) Action of the Office of Vital Records, Department of Health, to change the sex designation on a person's birth certificate from male to female, or female to male, based upon the person's subjective identification of sex, when that is inconsistent with the person's objective, biological sex, is inconsistent with the science of biology and legislative intent, and therefore necessitates remedial legislation; (13) Although some circuit courts have entered orders directing that the sex designation on a birth certificate be changed, other circuit courts have denied requests to change the sex designation on a birth certificate based upon a person's subjective identification of sex, when that is inconsistent with the person's objective, biological sex; (14) At least one circuit court has explicitly recognized that circuit courts are split on this issue; and (15) Because the uniform application of the law by circuit courts is of tantamount importance in the interest of justice, remedial legislation is therefore necessitated. Section 2. Legislative Findings. The Legislature finds that: (1) Allowing persons to have their vital records, including birth certificates, altered, in accordance with their subjective identification or feelings about their sex undermines the government's compelling interest in maintaining accurate vital records; (2) The government's compelling interest in maintaining accurate vital records extends to the fundamental performance of governmental functions that secure the public health and safety, including: (a) The identification of public health trends; (b) The identification of assessment risks; (c) The conduct of criminal investigations; and (d) Assisting persons in determining their citizenship, biological lineage, or susceptibility to genetic disorders; (3) The equal protection clause of the fourteenth amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits purposeful discrimination, but does not bar facially neutral laws of general applicability, such as a biology-based definition of sex that has been consistently applied since the founding of this nation; (4) The failure to maintain accurate, quantitative vital statistics and legal definitions, upon which members of the public and private sectors may rely, with confidence, constitutes a breach of the public trust; and (5) The government has a compelling interest in maintaining the public trust, instilling public confidence, and fulfilling, to the best of its ability, those functions that rely on the existence of accurate vital statistics.
