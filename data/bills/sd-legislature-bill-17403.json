BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 41-8-39 be amended to read as follows: 41-8-39. No person may intentionally kill or attempt to kill any wild bird or animal wildlife from any aircraft while in flight within this state , nor may any person use any aircraft for the purpose of hunting, taking, concentrating, driving, rallying, stirring up, locating, or spotting for any persons. Any person who, while in flight in an aircraft of any type, kills or attempts to kill any game bird or game animal or uses such aircraft for the purpose of hunting, taking, concentrating, driving, rallying, stirring up, spotting, or locating game birds or game animals for any persons, is guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor. The prohibitions of this section do not apply to any person who is acting within the scope of that person's official duties as an employee or authorized agent of the state or the United States to administer or protect or aid in the administration or protection of land, water, wildlife, livestock, domesticated animals, human life, or crops; or to any person acting within the limitations of a permit pursuant to \u00a7 41-8-39.1. Section 2. That \u00a7 41-8-39.1 be amended to read as follows: 41-8-39.1. Notwithstanding the provisions of \u00a7 41-8-39, any person resident of this state occupying land as an owner or lessee may make application to the Department of Game, Fish and Parks to obtain a permit to kill or attempt to kill coyotes or foxes from an aircraft to protect or aid in the protection of the owner's or lessee's land, water, wildlife, livestock, domesticated animals, human life, or crops, water, wildlife, or human life as permitted under PL 92-159, as amended to January 1, 1989 2002 , or \u00a7 40-36-9. A permit may not be issued for the purpose of sport hunting. The permit authorizes the owner or lessee or a person under contract with the owner or lessee to kill or attempt to kill coyotes or foxes from the aircraft on the occupied land and up to two miles onto the land of the immediate adjoining neighbor if the owner or lessee has first obtained the written consent of the owner or lessee of the adjoining land. The Game, Fish and Parks Commission shall promulgate rules pursuant to chapter 1-26 to establish the criteria and eligibility of the permittee and conditions under which the permit is granted, number and species of animals to be hunted and killed, location where permitted, reports required of the permittee, and other rules to implement the provisions of this section. Upon submission of a completed application to the department stating the resident's name, address, telephone number, resident hunting license number, county or counties where aerial hunting will occur, pilot certification data, and medical certificate data, the department shall issue the applicant a permit. Any person occupying land as an owner or lessee requiring protection of land, water, wildlife, livestock, domesticated animals, human life, or crops, may contact a pilot permitted for aerial hunting in that county. Upon receipt of the owner's or lessee's written authorization, the permitted pilot may aerial hunt over the owner's or lessee's property for fox and coyotes. An owner's or lessee's written authorization to any permitted pilot is effective for a period not to exceed one year. The permitted pilot shall keep daily records indicating the times, dates, and locations hunted and animals taken and shall file a report with the department within fifteen days after each calendar quarter. Section 3. That chapter 41-8 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: All rules promulgated by the Game, Fish and Parks Commission pursuant to authority granted pursuant to \u00a7 41-8-39.1 are hereby repealed."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 17403, "action_date": "2002-01-22T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 92568, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/92568.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 214, "committee_id_action": 768, "committee_id_assigned": 754, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 17403, "action_date": "2002-01-31T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 93309, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/93309.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 754, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 17403, "action_date": "2002-01-31T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 93309, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/93309.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass,", "journal_page": 390, "committee_id_action": 754, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 53861, "president_vote": null, "Excused": [2731, 2774], "Yea": [2756, 2764, 2765, 2769, 2779, 2811, 2825, 2786, 2748], "Nay": [2807, 2814]}}, {"bill_id": 17403, "action_date": "2002-02-01T13:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 93440, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/93440.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to another day", "journal_page": 419, "committee_id_action": 768, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 17403, "action_date": "2002-02-04T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 93580, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/93580.pdf", "status_text": "Tabled", "journal_page": 439, "committee_id_action": 768, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 54084, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [2724, 2725, 2728, 2729, 2731, 2732, 2735, 2736, 2737, 2738, 2741, 2748, 2749, 2752, 2754, 2755, 2756, 2757, 2758, 2759, 2763, 2764, 2765, 2766, 2768, 2769, 2771, 2774, 2777, 2779, 2781, 2782, 2785, 2786, 2788, 2790, 2793, 2797, 2798, 2800, 2803, 2804, 2805, 2806, 2807, 2808, 2811, 2812, 2813, 2814, 2815, 2817, 2820, 2822, 2824, 2825, 2826, 2830, 2751], "Excused": [2744, 2789], "Nay": [2767, 2770, 2773, 2775, 2783, 2794, 2799, 2816, 2823]}}]}
