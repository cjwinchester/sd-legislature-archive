However, if the vacancies set forth in the notice exist within a new school board of a newly created school district entity pursuant to \u00a7 13-6-62, the county auditor of the county having jurisdiction over the election shall publish the notice once each week for two consecutive weeks at least one month preceding the election.

The nominating petition shall be filed no later than five p.m. on the Friday thirty-nine days before the date of the election. However, if the nominating petition is from a candidate for a vacancy on a new school board within a newly created school district entity pursuant to \u00a7 13-6-62, the nominating petition shall be filed no later than thirty days prior to the date of the election. The petition is considered filed if it is mailed by registered or certified mail by five p.m. on the Friday thirty-nine days before the election.
