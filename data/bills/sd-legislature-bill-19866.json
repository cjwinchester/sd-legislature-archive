If the buffer zones are not created or maintained, the secretary shall conduct the required actions by any means available. If the cost associated with the actions conducted on behalf of the secretary are not paid by the responsible party, the cost shall be charged as taxes against each tract of land on which the expenses were incurred pursuant to \u00a7 38-22-23.14; (4) By mutual written consent to be kept on file by the Department of Agriculture, adjoining landowners may waive the requirement to create or maintain a buffer zone on their adjoining properties.
