The annual fee imposed in \u00a7 34A-2-117 is as follows: (1) The fee payable by the Department of Transportation is twenty-five thousand dollars per year. The fee accrues on August first of each year and is due on August thirty-first; (2) The fee for a construction site that is required to operate under a general water pollution control permit for stormwater discharges associated with construction activities as defined under 40 CFR Part 126 as amended to January 1, 2018, and issued under chapter 34A-2, other than any site owned by the Department of Transportation, is based on the number of acres disturbed for the entire construction project and the fee table below: The fee is payable by the owner of the site. For any construction site permitted before July 1, 2018, the first annual stormwater fee payment is due on January 31, 2019. Any future annual fee accrues on January first of each year and is due on January thirty-first until the permit coverage is terminated.
