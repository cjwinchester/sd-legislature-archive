Control is presumed to exist if a person, directly or indirectly, owns, controls, holds with the power to vote, or holds proxies representing ten percent or more of the voting securities of any other person. This presumption may be rebutted by a showing that control does not exist in fact; (7) \"Covered claim,\" (a) An unpaid claim, including one for unearned premiums, submitted by a claimant, which arises out of and is within the coverage and is subject to the applicable limits of an insurance policy to which this chapter applies issued by an insurer, if the insurer becomes an insolvent insurer after July 1, 1970, and: (i) The claimant or insured is a resident of this state at the time of the insured event. However, for entities other than an individual, the residence of a claimant, insured, or policyholder is the state in which its principal place of business is located at the time of the insured event; or (ii) The claim is a first party claim for damage to property with a permanent location in this state.

For purposes of this section, the term, affiliate, means a person who, directly or indirectly, through one or more intermediaries, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with another person. If the association determines that there may be more than one claimant having a covered claim or allowed claim against the association or any associations similar to the association or any property/casualty insurance security fund in other states, under the policy or policies of any one insolvent insurer, the association may establish a plan to allocate amounts payable by the association in such manner as the association in its discretion deems equitable.
