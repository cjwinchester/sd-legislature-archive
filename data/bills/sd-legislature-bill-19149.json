BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. The electors of any county may establish the office of county election supervisor as provided for by this Act. The board of county commissioners, by ordinance, or upon receiving a petition signed by not less than fifteen percent of the registered voters in the county, based upon the total number of registered voters at the last preceding general election, shall submit to the electors the question of whether to establish the office of county election supervisor authorized by this Act. A petition to discontinue the office of county election supervisor may be submitted to the board for submission to the electors of the county at an election in the same manner used to establish such office. The procedures established in chapter 7-18A shall govern such initiated measure and election. Section 2. In each county adopting an office of county election supervisor, pursuant to section 1 of this Act, the person elected to such office shall exercise all powers authorized by statute, rule, and the state constitution applicable to the county auditor concerning elections. The county election supervisor shall be elected in the same manner as other county officials are elected. Section 3. The county election supervisor shall perform all the duties required of such person by law of the county auditor relative to making out and delivering notices of special and general elections, to making abstracts of and canvassing the votes cast at any special or general election, to issuing certificates of election to members of the Legislature, county, and precinct officers, and to forwarding the abstracts of votes cast at general or special elections to the secretary of state. Section 4. If the board of county commissioners for any cause fails or refuses to call a special election, the county election supervisor may provide for and call any special election under any of the statutes of the state in force within such county, upon the petition of a majority of all the registered voters of the county, based upon the total number of registered voters at the last preceding general election preceding such call. Section 5. An action may be brought against the county election supervisor and the sureties upon the supervisor's official bond, in the name of the state and for its use, or for the use of any county or person injured by the misconduct in office of the supervisor, or by the omission of any duty required of the supervisor by law. Section 6. The county election supervisor's office shall remain open, upon the request of a person in charge of a school or municipal election, until the closing of the polls for that election. Section 7. The board of county commissioners shall establish, by resolution, the salary payable to the county election supervisor. Section 8. If the board of county commissioners deems it necessary for the prompt and accurate dispatch of business in the office of the county election supervisor that deputies or clerks be employed, the board shall by resolution fix the number of deputies or clerks to be employed, the time of employment, and compensation which the deputies and clerks shall receive. The compensation shall be paid monthly by warrant on the general fund."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 19149, "action_date": "2004-01-26T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 99935, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/99935.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 208, "committee_id_action": 831, "committee_id_assigned": 824, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 19149, "action_date": "2004-01-29T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 100248, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/100248.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 824, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 19149, "action_date": "2004-01-29T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 100248, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/100248.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to 36th legislative day", "journal_page": 297, "committee_id_action": 824, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 58797, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [3055, 3085, 3086, 3099, 3105, 3118, 3136, 3114, 3084], "Nay": [3075, 3100, 3119, 3134]}}, {"bill_id": 19149, "action_date": "2004-01-29T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 100248, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/100248.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to 36th legislative day", "journal_page": 297, "committee_id_action": 824, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 58797, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [3055, 3085, 3086, 3099, 3105, 3118, 3136, 3114, 3084], "Nay": [3075, 3100, 3119, 3134]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/19149"}
