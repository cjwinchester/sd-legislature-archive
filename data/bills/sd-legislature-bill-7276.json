That the code be amended by adding a NEW SECTION to read: Terms used in this Act mean: (1) \"Car rental company,\" a business with a primary purpose of renting motor vehicles to consumers under rental agreements for periods of ninety days or less; (2) \"Vehicle license cost recovery fee,\" a charge that may be separately stated and charged on the rental contract in a vehicle rental transaction originating in this state to recover costs incurred by a car rental company to license, title, register, plate, and inspect rental vehicles. Section 2. That the code be amended by adding a NEW SECTION to read: A car rental company may include separately stated surcharges, fees, or charges in a rental agreement, which may include vehicle license cost recovery fees, airport access fees, airport concession fees, and all applicable taxes. Section 3. That the code be amended by adding a NEW SECTION to read: If a car rental company includes a vehicle license cost recovery fee as a separately stated charge in a rental transaction, the amount of the fee shall represent the car rental company's good-faith estimate of the car rental company's daily charge as calculated by the car rental company to recover its actual total annual motor vehicle licensing, titling, registration, plating, and inspection costs. Section 4. That the code be amended by adding a NEW SECTION to read: If the total amount of the vehicle license cost recovery fees collected by a car rental company under this Act in any calendar year exceeds the car rental company's actual costs to license, title, register, plate, and inspect the motor vehicles for that calendar year, the car rental company shall do both of the following: (1) Retain the excess amount; and (2) Adjust the estimated average per vehicle license cost recovery fee for the following calendar year by a corresponding amount.
