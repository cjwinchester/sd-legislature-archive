BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 32-12-11 be amended to read as follows: 32-12-11. Any person who is at least fourteen years of age but less than eighteen years of age applying for a South Dakota operator's license, restricted minor's permit, or instruction permit who does not currently hold an operator's license, motorcycle operator's license, restricted minor's permit, motorcycle restricted minor's permit, instruction permit, or motorcycle instruction permit that has been valid continuously for one hundred eighty days, shall apply to the Department of Public Safety for an instruction permit which shall be held for a minimum of one hundred eighty continuous days. If an applicant holds an instruction permit that has been expired for thirty days or less, the department shall waive the knowledge test for the renewal of the instruction permit or to upgrade to an operator's license, motorcycle operator's license, restricted minor's permit or motorcycle restricted minor's permit. If the licensee applies and makes payment of the required fee thirty-one or more days after the expiration date of the license, the licensee shall take the knowledge test as required by \u00a7 32-12-4 and shall be issued an instruction permit upon passage of the test. The department may, after the applicant has successfully passed all parts of the examination other than the driving test and paid a fee which is equal in amount to the fee prescribed for a license in \u00a7 32-12-16, issue to the applicant an instruction permit. The instruction permit entitles the applicant , while having the permit in the applicant's immediate possession, to drive a motor vehicle upon the public highways for a period of one year during the hours of 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. if accompanied by a person holding a valid operator's license who is at least eighteen years of age, has had at least one year of driving experience, and who is occupying a seat beside the applicant. The applicant is entitled to drive a motor vehicle upon the public highways during the hours of 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. if the motor vehicle is being operated under the direction of the applicant's parent or guardian who is occupying a seat beside the applicant. The holder of an instruction permit may apply for a restricted minor's permit or operator's license after holding a valid instruction permit for one hundred eighty continuous days."}, {"bill_id":
