BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 13-32-9.2 be amended to read as follows: 13-32-9.2. If a suspension is reduced pursuant to \u00a7 13-32-9, a suspension for a first offense shall make the student ineligible for a minimum of two South Dakota High School Activities Association sanctioned events upon completion of the reduced suspension period. If two sanctioned events for which the student is ineligible do not take place within the reduced suspension period, the student's suspension remains in effect until two sanctioned events for which the student is ineligible have taken place. If a suspension is reduced pursuant to \u00a7 13-32-9, a suspension for a second offense shall make the student ineligible for a minimum of six South Dakota High School Activities Association sanctioned events upon completion of the reduced suspension period. If six sanctioned events for which the student is ineligible do not take place within the reduced suspension period, the student's suspension remains in effect until six sanctioned events for which the student is ineligible have taken place. To count toward the minimum number of events, the student must participate in the entire activity season and may not drop out or quit the activity to avoid suspension and the failure of a student to complete the entire activity season shall result in the student being ineligible for one year from the date of adjudication, conviction, the subject of an internal adjustment or court approved diversion program, or the subject of a suspended imposition of sentence or suspended adjudication of delinquency. A suspension that is not completed by the student during one activity season shall carry over to the next activity season in which the student participates. In addition, a suspension that is reduced pursuant to \u00a7 13-32-9 is only in effect during the South Dakota High School Activities Association's activity year, which begins on the first day of its first sanctioned event and concludes on the last day of its last sanctioned event. A reduced suspension that is not completed by the end of one activity year shall carry over to the next activity year. A suspension begins on the: (1) The day following the notification to a school administrator by the Unified Judicial System that a student has been adjudicated, convicted, the subject of an informal adjustment or court approved diversion program, or the subject of a suspended imposition of a sentence or a suspended adjudication of delinquency for possession, use, or distribution of controlled drugs, substances, or marijuana as defined in chapter 22-42, or for ingesting, inhaling, or otherwise taking into the body any substance prohibited by \u00a7 22-42-15 and the school administrator gives notice to the South Dakota High School Activities Association and the students; or (2) The day following the student's admission to a school administrator that the student committed an offense enumerated in subdivision (1), which shall be made with the student's parent or guardian present if the student is an unemancipated minor, and the school administrator gives notice to the South Dakota High School Activities Association."}, {"bill_id": 6293, "bill_version_id": 36352, "bill_version": "Enrolled", "bill_version_date": "2015-03-11T09:00:39.607-05:00", "bill_text": ""}], "amendments":
