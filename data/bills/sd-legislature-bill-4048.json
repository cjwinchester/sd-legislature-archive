As used in this chapter, the term, surrogate parent, means any individual certified by the Department of Education assigned by the district to act in place of the parent of a child in need of special education when the school district cannot identify or locate the parent or the child is a ward of the state. Section 2. That \u00a7 13-37-16 be amended to read as follows: 13-37-16. For taxes payable in 1997 2014, and each year thereafter, the school board shall levy no more than one dollar and forty fifty-three and three tenths cents per thousand dollars of taxable valuation, as a special levy in addition to all other levies authorized by law for the amount so determined to be necessary, and such levy shall be spread against all of the taxable property of the district. The proceeds derived from such levy shall constitute a school district special education fund of the district for the payment of costs for the special education of all children in need of special education or special education and related services who reside within the district pursuant to the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 13-37-8.2 to 13-37-8.10, inclusive. The levy in this section shall be based on valuations such that the median level of assessment represents 85% of market value as determined by the Department of Revenue. The total amount of taxes that would be generated at the levy pursuant to this section shall be considered local effort. Money in the special education fund may be expended for the purchase or lease of any assistive technology that is directly related to special education and specified in a student's individualized education plan. This section does not apply to real property improvements. For taxes payable in 2011, the total amount of revenue payable from the levy provided in this section may not increase more than the lesser of three percent or the index factor, as defined in \u00a7 10-13-38, over the maximum amount of revenue that could have been generated for the taxes payable in 2010. After applying the index factor, a school district may increase the revenue payable from taxes on real property above the limitations provided by this section by the percentage increase of value resulting from any improvements or change in use of real property, annexation, minor boundary changes, and any adjustments in taxation of real property separately classified and subject to statutory adjustments and reductions under chapters 10-4, 10-6, 10-6A, and 10-6B, except \u00a7 10-6-31.4, only if assessed the same as property of equal value. Any school district created or reorganized after January 1, 2009, is exempt from the limitation provided by this section for a period of two years immediately following its creation. For taxes payable in 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015, the total amount of revenue payable from the levy provided in this section may not increase more than the lesser of three percent or the index factor, as defined in \u00a7 10-13-38, over the maximum amount of revenue that could have been generated for the taxes payable in 2010 plus any unused index factor from the previous years. After applying the index factor, a school district may increase the revenue payable from taxes on real property above the limitations provided by this section by the percentage increase of value resulting from any improvements or change in use of real property, annexation, minor boundary changes, and any adjustments in taxation of real property separately classified and subject to statutory adjustments and reductions under chapters 10-4, 10-6, 10-6A, and 10-6B, except \u00a7 10-6-31.4, only if assessed the same as property of equal value.

Section 4. That \u00a7 13-37-16.3 be amended to read as follows: 13-37-16.3. Any adjustments in the levy specified in subdivision 13-37-35.1(19) 13-37-35.1(7) made pursuant to \u00a7 13-37-16.2 shall be based on maintaining the relationship between statewide local effort as a percentage of statewide local need in the fiscal year succeeding the fiscal year in which the adjustment is made. However, for fiscal year 2014, and each year thereafter, if the levy specified in subdivision 13-37-35.1(7) is not adjusted to maintain this relationship, the funding allocation for each disability level as defined in \u00a7 13-37-35.1 shall be reduced proportionally to maintain the relationship between statewide local effort as a percentage of statewide local need.
