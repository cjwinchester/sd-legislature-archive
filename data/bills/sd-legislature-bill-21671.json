BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That subdivision (7) of \u00a7 34-45-1 be amended to read as follows: (7) \"911 emergency surcharge,\" any charge set by the governing body and assessed on each local exchange access line which physically terminates within the governing body's designated 911 service area. For a mobile telecommunications service, the term, 911 emergency surcharge, means any charge set by the governing body and assessed per cellular telephone identified within the governing body's designated 911 service area as determined by the customer's place of primary use as defined in 4 U.S.C. \u00a7 124 as in effect on July 28, 2000. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter and for purposes of the surcharge imposed by this chapter, the surcharge imposed upon mobile telecommunication services shall be administered in accordance with 4 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 116-126 as in effect on July 28, 2000. For prepaid wireless telephone calling services, the term, 911 emergency surcharge, means any charge set by the governing body and assessed per month of service purchased pursuant to \u00a7 34-45-5 within the governing body's designated 911 service area; Section 2. That \u00a7 34-45-5 be amended to read as follows: 34-45-5. Any charge imposed pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 34-45-3 and 34-45-4 and required to be collected by the local exchange access company shall be added to, and shall be stated separately in, the billings to the service user. For prepaid wireless telephone service, any person or entity selling prepaid wireless service at retail in South Dakota, whether or not the prepaid wireless service is represented by a card or other item of tangible personal property transferred by the vendor to the purchaser, shall collect from the purchaser at the retail point of sale of the prepaid wireless service the 911 emergency surcharge authorized by \u00a7 \u00a7 34-45-3 and 35-45-4. The fee for prepaid wireless telephone service is one and one-half percent of the retail purchase price of the prepaid wireless telephone service. Any person or entity selling the prepaid wireless telephone service, other than a service provider, shall remit the fee collected to the applicable service provider. Section 3. That \u00a7 34-45-8.1 be repealed. 34-45-8.1. Each prepaid wireless telephone calling service provider shall remit the surcharge amount on each account for which service has been paid and not yet used to the governing body each calendar quarter pursuant to \u00a7 34-45-8. The surcharge amount shall be remitted to the location associated with the telephone number that is programmed into the wireless telephone that will be providing prepaid wireless telephone service. If the prepaid wireless telephone calling service provider is unable to determine the location of the customer, the surcharge amount shall be remitted based on the place at which the customer paid for the prepaid wireless telephone service. The prepaid wireless telephone calling service provider may deduct units of usage equivalent to the amount of the surcharge from the unused telecommunication service, if the provider has so notified the purchaser at or before the time of purchase."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 21671, "action_date": "2007-01-30T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 111185, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/111185.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 261, "committee_id_action": 923, "committee_id_assigned": 911, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 21671, "action_date": "2007-02-07T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 111737, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/111737.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 911, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 21671, "action_date": "2007-02-14T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 112259, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/112259.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 911, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 21671, "action_date": "2007-02-14T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 112259, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/112259.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass Amended,", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 911, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "F", "vote": {"vote_id": 65194, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [3572, 3576, 3588, 3592, 3642, 3644, 3645, 3650, 3663, 3658], "Yea": [3619, 3622, 3676]}}, {"bill_id": 21671, "action_date": "2007-02-14T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 112259, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/112259.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to 41st legislative day", "journal_page": 516, "committee_id_action": 911, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 65195, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [3572, 3576, 3588, 3592, 3619, 3622, 3642, 3644, 3645, 3650, 3663, 3676, 3658]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/21671"}
