The South Dakota Investment Council, or its successor, shall invest the trust fund in stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and other financial instruments, as provided by law. Beginning in fiscal year 2025, and each fiscal year thereafter, the state treasurer shall make a distribution from the interest and income of the trust fund for unclaimed property into the state general fund. The calculation of the distribution shall be defined by law and may promote growth of the fund and a steadily growing distribution amount. The distribution shall be appropriated as determined by the Legislature. The principal of trust fund for unclaimed property may not be invaded, unless approved by a three-fourths vote of all the members-elect of each house of the Legislature or unless the state treasurer determines that such amounts are necessary for the payment of claims."}], "amendments": [{"bill_id": 22250, "document_id": 218448, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/218448.pdf", "legislator_profile_id": 1802, "document_id_instructions": 218449, "document_id_instructions_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/218449.pdf"}], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 22250, "action_date": "2021-02-02T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 215283, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/215283.pdf", "status_text": "Referred to", "journal_page": 179, "committee_id_action": 492, "committee_id_assigned": 498, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 22250, "action_date": "2021-02-04T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 216396, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/216396.pdf", "status_text": "Referred to", "journal_page": 209, "committee_id_action": 492, "committee_id_assigned": 488, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 22250, "action_date": "2021-02-23T10:30:00-06:00", "document_id": 217887, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/217887.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 1, "committee_id_action": 488, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 22250, "action_date": "2021-02-23T10:30:00-06:00", "document_id": 217888, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/217888.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 488, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 69839, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [1784], "Yea": [1796, 1799, 1822, 1826, 3785, 3806, 1802, 1809]}}, {"bill_id": 22250, "action_date": "2021-02-24T13:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 218301, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/218301.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to another day", "journal_page": 381, "committee_id_action": 492, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 22250, "action_date": "2021-02-25T13:30:00-06:00", "document_id": 218457, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/218457.pdf", "status_text": "Motion to amend", "journal_page": 414, "committee_id_action": 492, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 22250, "action_date": "2021-02-25T13:30:00-06:00", "document_id": 218457, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/218457.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass Amended", "journal_page": 414, "committee_id_action": 492, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "F", "vote": {"vote_id": 70146, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [1766, 1767, 1768, 1770, 1772, 1777, 1778, 1780, 1784, 1792, 1795, 1800, 1804, 1813, 1824, 1829, 1835, 1839, 1843, 1844, 1852, 1866, 1868, 1883, 3782, 3783, 3787, 3788, 3789, 3790, 3791, 3792, 3794, 3797, 3800, 3801, 3802, 3804], "Excused": [1769, 1817], "Yea": [1781, 1782, 1788, 1793, 1796, 1798, 1799, 1802, 1805, 1807, 1809, 1820, 1822, 1823, 1826, 1830, 1832, 1834, 1836, 1837, 1841, 1855, 1862, 1864, 3784, 3785, 3786, 3793, 3799, 3806]}}]}
