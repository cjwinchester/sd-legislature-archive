WHEREAS, in-state advertising agencies are better suited to deliver a message that resonates with this state's residents than large out-of-state firms who are not the residents' friends or neighbors; and WHEREAS, in-state advertising agencies provide more resourceful services than out-of-state agencies as they know the media market values for advertisement placements and alternatives; and WHEREAS, this state signals to college students that good work and stable jobs primarily exist out of state when awarding contracts to out-of-state advertising agencies; and WHEREAS, awarding contracts to in-state advertising agencies would be consistent with this state's plea to its citizens to shop local, and to work and live in this state; and WHEREAS, awarding contracts to in-state advertising agencies would boost this state's economy by recirculating tax dollars because agencies do business with other in-state companies, employee wages are paid from agency business, and sales tax revenue is generated from in-state spending. The recirculation of tax dollars not only provides jobs for advertising agencies, but also for many others, including media vendors, grocery store clerks, and teachers. Studies show that sixty-eight jobs are supported for every one million dollars spent in advertising in this state. In short, when money leaves this state, so do jobs: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the House of Representatives of the Ninety-Sixth Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the Senate concurring therein, that the Executive Branch of this state is urged to give preference in advertising contracts to in-state agencies over out-state agencies as permitted by law."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 22367, "action_date": "2021-02-22T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 217863, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/217863.pdf", "status_text": "First Reading House", "journal_page": 327, "committee_id_action": 492, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 22367, "action_date": "2021-02-23T13:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 218119, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/218119.pdf", "status_text": "Committee assignment waived", "journal_page": 355, "committee_id_action": 492, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 22367, "action_date": "2021-02-24T13:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 218301, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/218301.pdf", "status_text": "Adopt Resolution", "journal_page": 381, "committee_id_action": 492, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 70030, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [1766, 1767, 1768, 1770, 1772, 1777, 1778, 1780, 1781, 1782, 1784, 1788, 1792, 1793, 1796, 1798, 1799, 1800, 1802, 1804, 1805, 1807, 1813, 1820, 1823, 1824, 1826, 1829, 1830, 1832, 1834, 1835, 1836, 1839, 1841, 1843, 1844, 1852, 1855, 1862, 1864, 1866, 1868, 1883, 3782, 3783, 3784, 3785, 3786, 3787, 3788, 3789, 3790, 3791, 3792, 3793, 3794, 3797, 3799, 3800, 3801, 3802, 3804, 3806], "Excused": [1769, 1795, 1817], "Nay": [1809, 1822, 1837]}}, {"bill_id": 22367, "action_date": "2021-02-25T13:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 218426, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/218426.pdf", "status_text": "First read in Senate and referred to", "journal_page": 349, "committee_id_action": 514, "committee_id_assigned": 515, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 22367, "action_date": "2021-03-01T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 218481, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/218481.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 515, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 22367, "action_date": "2021-03-01T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 218482, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/218482.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to the 41st legislative day", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 515, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 70256, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [1850, 1785, 1881, 1771, 1775], "Nay": [1851, 3805, 1801], "Excused": [1783]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/22367"}
