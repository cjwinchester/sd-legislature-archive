Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of South Dakota: Section 1. That a NEW SECTION be added: 13-55-79. Dakota's promise scholarship program--Establishment--Purposes. There is established the Dakota's promise scholarship program.

A student may receive a Dakota's promise scholarship for up to four academic years, or until the student obtains a baccalaureate degree, whichever comes first. Section 5.

When a scholarship is issued, the executive director may distribute funding from the Dakota's promise fund established in \u00a7 13-55-85 at the rate of one dollar from the fund for every one dollar of private funding allocated to the eligible students by the participating institution.
