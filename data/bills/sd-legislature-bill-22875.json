WHEREAS, article I, section 8, clause 11 & 15, of the Constitution of the United States vests in the United States Congress the exclusive power to declare war and to call forth the Militia; and WHEREAS, despite the clear language of the Constitution of the United States, the United States Congress has abdicated its constitutional power, too often vesting the power to make war solely in the Federal Executive Branch; and WHEREAS, the first President of the United States, George Washington, wrote: \"The Constitution vests the power of declaring war in Congress; therefore no offensive expedition of importance can be undertaken until after they shall have deliberated upon the subject and authorized such a measure\" and \u201cOvergrown military establishments are under any form of government inauspicious to liberty, and are to be regarded as particularly hostile to republican liberty.\u201d; and WHEREAS, the father of the Constitution of the United States and the fourth President, James Madison, wrote: \"The Constitution supposes, what the history of all governments demonstrates, that the Executive is the branch of power most interested in war, and most prone to it... It has accordingly with studied care vested the question of war in the Legislature.\u201d \u201cThe executive has no right, in any case, to decide the question, whether there is or is not cause for declaring war.\u201d; and WHEREAS, the author of the Declaration of Independence and the third President, Thomas Jefferson, wrote: \"Considering that Congress alone is constitutionally invested with the power of changing our condition from peace to war, I have thought it my duty to await their authority for using force in any degree which could be avoided\"; and WHEREAS, another constitutional framer and the first Secretary of the Treasury, Alexander Hamilton, wrote: \"The Congress shall have the power to declare war; the plain meaning of which is that it is the peculiar and exclusive duty of the United States Congress, when the nation is at peace, to change that state into a state of war.\"; and WHEREAS, contrary to these clear intentions of the Founding Fathers, the United States Congress has not declared war in over seventy years, and the nation has since gone to war repeatedly at the direction of the Executive Branch; and WHEREAS, even when the United States Congress has passed authorizations for the use of military force in the past 70 years, they have featured broad and unspecific language that has consistently empowered the Executive Branch to engage in open-ended war with little to none of the oversight and debate about our foreign policy that the Founding Fathers intended; and WHEREAS, due to its broad and unspecific language, the 2001 Authorization for the Use of Military Force has been invoked over 41 times to deploy United States troops to over 19 countries since 2001, far beyond the intended scope of its sponsors; and WHEREAS, the decision to put an American soldier in harm's way is among the most important votes a Legislator can take; and WHEREAS, South Dakota is home to Ellsworth Air Force Base, almost 3,000 active duty personnel, forty-two Army Guard units, seventeen Air Guard units, over 4,100 Guard personnel, over 550 reserve military personnel, and over 64,100 veterans; and WHEREAS, the United States' post-9/11 wars alone have carried a heavy price, including more than 7,000 service members lost in war operations, over 30,000 service member and veterans suicides, over 53,000 wounded, an estimated 1.1 million veterans who have developed service-connected disabilities, and over $8 trillion spent; and WHEREAS, 68 percent of American veterans supported bringing our troops home from Afghanistan, and 51 percent of veterans and the general population think we should be less militarily engaged around the world, according to 2021 polling: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the House of Representatives of the Ninety-Seventh Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the Senate concurring therein, that (1) The President of the United States and the United States Congress be urged to take no action to employ military forces of the United States in active-duty combat unless and until the United States Congress has passed an official declaration of war or has taken an official action or renewed action to authorize the use of military force except for when our forces must respond to attack; (2) The President of the United States and the United States Congress be urged to follow the Just War Theory when contemplating foreign intervention; (3) The President of the United States and the United States Congress be urged to repeal the 2001 Authorization for the Use of Military Force and to ensure any future authorizations feature geographic and mission-specific language on their intended scope, regular reporting on their use, and automatic sunsets to require their periodic review, debate, and approval by recorded vote; (4) The State of South Dakota call on the President of the United States and the United States Congress to end any periods of endless or perpetual armed conflict with no clear conditions of conclusion or connection to our vital national interests that risk the lives of our military members; (5) That the State of South Dakota reaffirm its support of our armed forces who have sworn to protect and defend our union\u2019s freedom and prosperity; and (6) That the Secretary of State send a copy of this resolution to the President of the United States, the Majority Leader of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, and the members of the South Dakota Congressional Delegation with the request that this resolution be officially entered into the congressional record."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 22875, "action_date": "2022-01-27T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 230262, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/230262.pdf", "status_text": "First Reading House", "journal_page": 136, "committee_id_action": 1008, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 22875, "action_date": "2022-01-31T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 231012, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/231012.pdf", "status_text": "Referred to", "journal_page": 156, "committee_id_action": 1008, "committee_id_assigned": 1013, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 22875, "action_date": "2022-02-16T15:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 232978, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/232978.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 1013, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 22875, "action_date": "2022-02-16T15:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 232979, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/232979.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 1013, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 74019, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [3931, 3933, 3941, 3967, 3980, 4005, 4015, 3945, 3986], "Excused": [3951, 3957, 3977], "Nay": [3985]}}, {"bill_id": 22875, "action_date": "2022-02-22T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 234122, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/234122.pdf", "status_text": "Adopt Resolution", "journal_page": 402, "committee_id_action": 1008, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 74358, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [3912, 3913, 3914, 3915, 3916, 3917, 3919, 3923, 3924, 3927, 3928, 3929, 3931, 3933, 3934, 3937, 3938, 3941, 3944, 3945, 3946, 3947, 3948, 3950, 3951, 3953, 3954, 3955, 3957, 3959, 3963, 3964, 3965, 3967, 3968, 3969, 3970, 3971, 3972, 3973, 3976, 3977, 3980, 3981, 3982, 3983, 3984, 3985, 3986, 3987, 3988, 3989, 3992, 3995, 3997, 4001, 4004, 4005, 4007, 4008, 4009, 4013, 4014, 4015, 3942], "Nay": [3930, 3978], "Excused": [3960, 3998, 4011]}}, {"bill_id": 22875, "action_date": "2022-02-23T13:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 234394, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/234394.pdf", "status_text": "First read in Senate and referral to committee waived pursuant to JR 6D-1", "journal_page": 327, "committee_id_action": 1034, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 22875, "action_date": "2022-02-24T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 234631, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/234631.pdf", "status_text": "Tabled", "journal_page": 379, "committee_id_action": 1034, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 74646, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [3918, 3920, 3921, 3922, 3925, 3926, 3932, 3935, 3936, 3939, 3940, 3943, 3949, 3952, 3956, 3958, 3961, 3962, 3966, 3974, 3975, 3979, 3990, 3991, 3993, 3994, 3996, 3999, 4000, 4002, 4003, 4006, 4010, 4012, 4016]}}]}
