BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. The School for the Blind and the Visually Impaired shall relocate from its site in Aberdeen, Brown County, to a new facility to be constructed on the Jerde Hall site of the Northern State University campus, and shall assume jurisdiction over the new facility and its grounds. Upon completion of the relocation, Northern State University shall assume jurisdiction over the real estate and facilities currently occupied by the School for the Blind and the Visually Impaired. Section 2. The Legislature finds: (1) That the relocation and transfers of jurisdiction authorized by section 1 of this Act affect properties within two separate institutional trusts in the permanent endowment trust, and, to comport with S.D. Const. Art. VIII, \u00a7 7, the relocation and transfers shall be structured to preserve the value of each institutional trust; (2) That the real estate and fixtures comprising the campus of the School for the Blind and the Visually Impaired form part of the permanent endowment trust for the benefit of the School for the Blind and the Visually Impaired, having been donated by the City of Aberdeen pursuant to chapter 242 of the 1957 Session Laws and chapter 77 of the 1959 Session Laws; and that the appraised value for the real estate and fixtures is approximately one million four hundred forty-five thousand dollars; (3) That Jerde Hall on the campus of Northern State University was placed in the permanent endowment trust pursuant to chapter 154 of the 1986 Session Laws, for the benefit of the state universities, and that the appraised value for the real estate and fixtures is approximately eight hundred fifty thousand dollars; (4) That the estimated project cost of a new facility for the School for the Blind and the Visually Impaired is thirteen million five hundred fifty-eight thousand nine hundred ninety-three dollars; (5) That the most expedient means to implement section 1 of this Act consistent with constitutional requirements is to remove Jerde Hall and its grounds from the permanent endowment trust for the state universities prior to the construction of a new facility for the School for the Blind and the Visually Impaired and to replace Jerde Hall and its grounds with a different Northern State University property from outside the permanent endowment trust for the state universities that has equal or greater appraised value than Jerde Hall; and (6) That Wolves Memorial Suites, a student residence facility constructed in 2017 on the campus of Northern State University pursuant to chapter 13-51A, with an appraised value of six million six hundred ninety-two thousand dollars, does not form part of the permanent endowment trust, being situated on land, with an appraised value of two hundred fifty-three thousand dollars, acquired by the state for the benefit of Northern State University in three purchases with general funds appropriated by chapter 205 of the 1966 Session Laws, and, pursuant to contracts for deed, with parking fees appropriated by chapter 112 of the 1972 Session Laws, and with parking fees appropriated by chapter 166 of the 1977 Session Laws.

All monies deposited into that fund are hereby appropriated to the projects authorized by this Act, subject to the limitations stated in sections 4, 6, and 7 of this Act. Section 9. The administration of the design and construction of the projects authorized in this Act shall be under the general charge and supervision of the Bureau of Administration as provided in chapter 5-14.
