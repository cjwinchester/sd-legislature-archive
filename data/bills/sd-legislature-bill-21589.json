BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. The Legislature finds: (1) That a pregnant mother possesses certain inherent rights, that these are natural intrinsic rights which enjoy affirmative protection under the Constitution of the United States, and under the Constitution and laws of the State of South Dakota, and that among these rights are the fundamental right of the pregnant mother to her relationship with her child, her fundamental right to make decisions that advance the well-being and welfare of her child, and her interest in her own health; (2) That the pregnant mother's relationship with her child is inherently beneficial to the mother; that a mother's unique relationship with her child during pregnancy is one of the most intimate and important relationships, and one most worthy of legal protection; that the history and tradition of our nation has recognized this relationship as one that has intrinsic beauty and benefit to both the mother and the child; and that this relationship is recognized as one of the touchstones, and at the core, of all civilized society; (3) That all induced abortions, whether surgically or chemically induced, terminate the life of an entire, unique, living human being, a human being separate from his or her mother, as a matter of scientific and biological fact, and terminate that pregnant mother's existing natural relationship with her child; (4) That a physician performing an abortion terminates the life of one of the physician's patients to whom the physician owes a professional and legal duty, which duty is extinguished, under existing law, by the exercise of a written consent to an abortion by the pregnant mother of the unborn child; (5) That a large percentage of the decisions made by pregnant mothers to give up their rights and interests in their relationship with their children by submitting to an abortion, are not truly informed and voluntary; that there are inherently coercive aspects to the abortion procedure; and that often the uninformed and difficult nature of the decision is seriously compounded by the practices of abortion providers; (6) That an abortion is an unworkable method for a pregnant mother to give up, surrender, or waive her fundamental right to her relationship with her child; (7) That in the majority of cases there is no normal or traditional physician-patient relationship or counseling between a pregnant mother contemplating submitting to an abortion and the physician who performs the abortion; (8) That submitting to an abortion subjects the pregnant woman to significant health risks; that the abortion procedure is inherently dangerous to the psychological and physical health of the woman; that an abortion places most women at greater risk for psychological distress, depression, suicidal ideation and suicide than carrying her child to full term and giving birth; (9) That the State of South Dakota possesses a duty to protect, and it is a legitimate exercise of the State's power to protect, the natural intrinsic rights and interests of a pregnant mother in her relationship with her child; in her ability to protect the well- being of her child; and her own health; (10) That the State of South Dakota possesses a duty to protect, and it is a legitimate exercise of the State's power to protect, the life of each human being within its borders, including those human beings living in utero; (11) That it is neither practical nor possible for the State to simultaneously protect these fundamental rights and interests of pregnant mothers and the lives of their children, and, at the same time, provide legal authority or protection for the act of a physician who terminates the lives of these mothers' unborn children by an abortion; that protection of these rights of the mothers are in conflict with protection of the act of the physician which terminates these rights by terminating the life of the unborn child; (12) That the right and duty of the State to protect and preserve the life of the unborn child cannot co-exist with a law that authorizes the termination of that life by the physician; (13) That it is now clear that the State of South Dakota can either protect the mother's fundamental natural intrinsic rights, or protect the physician's act that terminates and adversely affects them, but that the State cannot effectively protect both; and that the State's duty is to protect the natural and intrinsic rights of the pregnant mother and the life of her unborn child, and must, therefore, prohibit physicians from terminating these rights and interests by the performance of abortions, to the fullest reasonable extent federal law shall permit, consistent with the provisions of this Act. Section 2. That chapter 22-17 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Any person who knowingly performs any procedure upon a pregnant mother, or who uses any instrument upon a pregnant mother, or who administers any medicine or drug or substance or device to a pregnant mother, or who prescribes or procures or sells any medicine or drug or substance or device for use by a pregnant mother, with the intent of causing or abetting the termination of the life of an unborn human being, is guilty of a Class 4 felony. This section shall not apply if a licensed physician is performing a surgical or medical abortion for one of the following reasons: (1) The physician has made an appropriate and reasonable medical judgment, the bases of which shall be specifically identified and documented in the pregnant mother's medical records, that the abortion is necessary to save the life of the mother; (2) The physician has made an appropriate and reasonable medical judgment, the bases of which shall be specifically identified and documented in the pregnant mother's medical records, that the abortion is necessary in order to prevent a devastating and irreversible injury to the mother's health, which is likely to cause a very significant impairment of the functioning of a major bodily organ or system, and which is likely to cause a very significant impairment of the quality of the mother's life. However, the physician may only proceed with the abortion if a second physician, not associated in practice with the first, also makes the same judgment in writing after examining the pregnant mother and reviewing all appropriate medical records and tests; (3) The physician has determined that the pregnancy is the result of a rape, as that term is defined in \u00a7 22-22-1, in which cases, the following conditions apply: (a) The abortion cannot be performed later than seventeen weeks following the date of the mother's last menstrual period, as confirmed by a sonogram and other conventional methods; (b) Before performing the procedure the physician shall confirm by personally obtaining a copy of the record of the report from the entity to which the report was made that the pregnant mother had reported the rape within fifty days of the event to the appropriate law enforcement authorities, and, if the rape allegation is made pursuant to subdivision 22-22-1(5), shall confirm that the report contains the name and last known address of the alleged perpetrator, and, in all other instances, shall confirm that the report contains either the name and last known address of the alleged perpetrator or, if the identity of the perpetrator is unknown, contains a description of the alleged perpetrator to the best of the mother's ability; (c) Before performing the procedure the physician shall obtain the consent of the mother to have a blood sample drawn or other biological sample collected from both herself and from the remains of the child, so that these can be provided by the physician to the appropriate law enforcement authorities so that DNA testing may be performed; (d) The physician shall draw the blood samples or collect the other biological samples, and shall then secure and clearly label the samples, and shall take such steps as are appropriate and necessary to preserve the samples, until transfer to the law enforcement authorities; (e) The physician shall contact the law enforcement authorities by telephone, shall advise the law enforcement authorities that the physician has obtained samples pursuant to this section, and shall arrange with the law enforcement authorities to transfer custody of the samples to the authorities within twenty-four hours after the procedure is performed; (f) The physician shall document all the actions taken pursuant to this subdivision and shall maintain copies of all the documents and consents as part of the mother's permanent medical records; (4) The physician has determined that the pregnancy is the result of an incest, as that term is defined in \u00a7 22-22A-1, in which cases, the following conditions apply: (a) The abortion cannot be performed later than seventeen weeks following the date of the mother's last menstrual period, as confirmed by a sonogram and other conventional methods; (b) Before performing the procedure the physician shall obtain the consent of the mother to report the incest together with the name and last known address of the alleged perpetrator to the appropriate law enforcement authorities; (c) Before performing the procedure the physician shall contact the appropriate law enforcement authorities by telephone, shall advise the law enforcement authorities that the physician is making a report of incest, pursuant to this section, and shall provide the name and address of the pregnant mother together with the name and last known address of the alleged perpetrator, as provided by the mother; (d) Before performing the procedure the physician shall provide the mother with the location of the office of the Department of Social Services nearest to the mother's residence and nearest to the location of the facility where the procedure is to be performed, and shall inform the mother that the department will upon request provide counseling and other supportive services to the mother; (e) Before performing the procedure the physician shall obtain the consent of the mother to have a blood sample drawn or other biological sample collected from both herself and from the remains of the child, so that these can be provided by the physician to the appropriate law enforcement authorities so that DNA testing may be performed; (f) The physician shall draw the blood samples or collect the other biological samples, shall secure and clearly label the samples, and shall take such steps as are appropriate and necessary to preserve the samples, until transfer to the law enforcement authorities; (g) The physician shall contact the law enforcement authorities by telephone, shall advise the law enforcement authorities that the physician has obtained samples pursuant to this section, and shall arrange with the law enforcement authorities to transfer custody of the samples to the authorities within twenty-four hours after the procedure is performed; (h) The physician shall document all the actions taken pursuant to this subdivision and shall maintain copies of all the documents and consents as part of the mother's permanent medical records.

That chapter 22-17 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Nothing in section 2 of this Act prohibits the prescription or sale or use or administration of a contraceptive medicine or drug or substance or device, if prescribed or sold or used or administered prior to the time when it could be determined that the woman is pregnant through conventional medical testing, and if the contraceptive measure is prescribed or sold in accordance with manufacturer instructions.

BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. The following bill, which is hereby agreed to, is referred to a vote of the people of the State of South Dakota at the next general election: FOR AN ACT ENTITLED: An Act to regulate the performance of certain abortions, to reinstate the prohibition against certain acts causing the termination of the life of an unborn human being, and to prescribe a penalty therefor. BE IT ENACTED BY THE PEOPLE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. The people of the State of South Dakota find: (1) That all induced abortions, whether surgically or chemically induced, terminate the life of an entire, unique, living human being, a human being separate from his or her mother, as a matter of scientific and biological fact; (2) That the State of South Dakota possesses a duty to protect, and it is a legitimate exercise of the state's power to protect, the life of each human being within its borders, including those human beings living in utero; (3) That submitting to an abortion subjects the pregnant woman to significant psychological and physical health risk; (4) That in the majority of cases there is neither the typical physician-patient relationship nor sufficient counseling between a pregnant woman contemplating submitting to an abortion and the physician who performs the abortion. As a consequence of this and related factors, a large percentage of the decisions made by pregnant women to abort are not truly informed and voluntary; (5) The state has a right and duty to protect the life of the unborn child, and to protect the life, health, and well-being of any pregnant woman within its jurisdiction, and it is therefore necessary to reasonably balance these interests to allow abortions only in certain circumstances which are set forth within this Act.

The following bill, which is hereby agreed to, is referred to a vote of the people of the State of South Dakota at the next general election: FOR AN ACT ENTITLED: An Act to regulate the performance of certain abortions, to reinstate the prohibition against certain acts causing the termination of the life of an unborn human being, and to prescribe a penalty therefor. BE IT ENACTED BY THE PEOPLE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. The people of the State of South Dakota find: (1) That all induced abortions, whether surgically or chemically induced, terminate the life of an entire, unique, living human being, a human being separate from his or her mother, as a matter of scientific and biological fact; (2) That the State of South Dakota possesses a duty to protect, and it is a legitimate exercise of the state's power to protect, the life of each human being within its borders, including those human beings living in utero; (3) That submitting to an abortion subjects the pregnant woman to significant psychological and physical health risk; (4) That in the majority of cases there is neither the typical physician-patient relationship nor sufficient counseling between a pregnant woman contemplating submitting to an abortion and the physician who performs the abortion. As a consequence of this and related factors, a large percentage of the decisions made by pregnant women to abort are not truly informed and voluntary; (5) That a pregnant mother possesses certain intrinsic rights which enjoy affirmative protection under the Constitution of the United States, and under the Constitution and laws of the State of South Dakota, and that among these rights are the fundamental right of the pregnant mother to a relationship with her child, and her fundamental right to make decisions that advance the well-being and welfare of her child; (6) The state has a right and duty to protect the life of the unborn child, and to protect the life, health, and well-being of any pregnant woman within its jurisdiction, and it is therefore necessary to reasonably balance these interests to allow abortions only in certain circumstances which are set forth within this Act. Section 2. That chapter 22-17 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Any person who knowingly performs an abortion, as defined in this Act, is guilty of a Class 4 felony. This section does not apply if a licensed physician is performing an abortion for one of the following reasons: (1) The physician has made a good faith clinical judgment, consistent with the accepted standards of medical practice, the basis of which shall be specifically identified and documented in the woman's medical records, that an abortion is necessary to avert the death of the mother; (2) The physician has made a good faith clinical judgment, consistent with the accepted standards of medical practice, the basis of which shall be specifically identified and documented in the woman's medical records, that an abortion is necessary because there is a serious risk of a substantial and irreversible impairment of the functioning of a major bodily organ or system of the mother should the pregnancy be continued; (3) The woman has reported to the physician that the pregnancy is the result of a rape as defined in \u00a7 22-22-1; or an incest as defined in this Act, in which she was the victim; and in either circumstance the following conditions apply: (a) The abortion is performed before the completion of the twentieth week following the mother's last menstrual period, as determined in the physician's good faith clinical judgment, consistent with the accepted standards of medical practice, and as confirmed by a sonogram and other conventional methods; (b) If the rape or aggravated incest has been previously reported to law enforcement, then before performing the abortion, the physician or his agent shall obtain a copy of the written record of the report from law enforcement and maintain it in the woman's medical records; (c) If the rape or aggravated incest has not been previously reported to law enforcement, then before performing the abortion, the physician or the physician's agent shall advise the woman that such a report must be made, and shall report the rape or aggravated incest immediately by telephone or otherwise to the state's attorney or law enforcement of the county in which the rape or aggravated incest occurred, or, if the location is unknown, to the state's attorney or law enforcement of the county in which the report is made to the physician; (d) The report required by this section shall include the name, address, and date of birth of the woman, and, to the best of the woman's ability, the date or dates of the reported rape or aggravated incest, the location where it occurred, and either the name and address of the perpetrator, if known, or, if not known, a description of the perpetrator; (e) Prior to the abortion, the physician, or the physician's agent, shall obtain the woman's consent to collect a buccal or other biological sample from the woman, and to collect a tissue sample from the remains of the embryo or fetus, each sufficient to perform forensic DNA analysis. After obtaining such samples, the physician shall secure, clearly label and refrigerate the samples, until transferred to law enforcement; (f) The physician, or the physician's agent, shall within twenty-four hours after the abortion is performed, contact law enforcement and advise that the physician has obtained samples pursuant to this section, and arrange with the law enforcement to transfer custody of the samples; (g) The physician, or the physician's agent, shall provide the woman with the phone numbers and addresses of counseling services qualified in counseling victims of rape or incest in the area of her residence and also in the area in which the procedure is performed; (h) The physician shall document all the actions taken pursuant to this section and shall maintain copies of all the documents and consents as part of the woman's permanent medical records; (i) Nothing in this section limits a physician's duty to report any information required by any other provision of South Dakota law. Section 3. That chapter 22-17 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Each facility which performs abortions shall have a written policy on reporting rape and aggravated incest. Section 4. That chapter 22-17 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: The Department of Health shall publish, within one hundred eighty days after the effective date of this Act, forms to aid physicians in the accurate collection and reporting of information pursuant to this Act. Such forms will include the texts of \u00a7 22-22-1, and of the definition of incest in subdivision (4) of section 8 of this Act, and of \u00a7 25-1-6. The department shall also provide, upon request, materials necessary to collect and preserve the biological samples required by this Act. Section 5. That chapter 22-17 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Nothing in section 2 of this Act prohibits the prescription, sale, use or administration of a contraceptive medicine, drug, substance or device, if prescribed, sold, used or administered prior to the time when it could be determined that the woman is pregnant through conventional medical testing, and if the contraceptive measure is prescribed or sold in accordance with manufacturer instructions. Nothing in section 2 of this Act prohibits any person from assisting a pregnant mother in obtaining an abortion in any other state where such a procedure is legal. Section 6. That chapter 22-17 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Whenever a physician is performing an abortion permitted by the provisions of section 2 of this Act, the physician shall make reasonable medical efforts under the circumstances to preserve both the life of the mother and the life of her unborn child in a manner consistent with conventional medical practice. Section 7. That chapter 22-17 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Medical treatment provided to the mother by a licensed physician which results in the accidental or unintentional injury or death of the unborn child is not a violation of this Act. Nothing in this Act subjects the pregnant mother upon whom any abortion is performed or attempted to any criminal conviction and penalty for an unlawful abortion. No woman making a report of incest under this Act is subject to criminal prosecution for the incest. No good faith report of rape or incest under this Act may provide the basis for any criminal prosecution against the woman making such a report. Section 8. That chapter 22-17 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Terms used in this Act mean: (1) \"Abortion,\" any procedure upon a pregnant mother, or use of any instrument upon a pregnant mother, or administration of any medicine or drug or substance or device to a pregnant mother, or prescription or procurement or sale of any medicine or drug or substance or device for use by a pregnant mother, with the intent of causing or abetting the termination of the life of an unborn human being; (2) \"Pregnant,\" the human female reproductive condition of having a living unborn child within the mother's body, throughout the entire embryonic and fetal ages of the unborn child from fertilization to full gestation and child birth; (3) \"Unborn human being\" and \"unborn child,\" an individual living member of the species homo sapiens throughout the entire embryonic and fetal ages from fertilization to full gestation and childbirth; (4) \"Incest,\" an act of sexual penetration, as defined in \u00a7 22-22-2, involving persons who are related to each other within the degrees of consanguinity within which marriages are, by the laws of this state, declared void pursuant to \u00a7 25-1-6, or where one of the persons is the child of the perpetrator or the child of a spouse or former spouse of the perpetrator. Section 9. That chapter 22-17 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Chapters 187 and 188 of the 2005 Session Laws shall take effect pursuant to section 7 of chapter 187, as amended by section 1 of chapter 188, only in the event that the provisions of section 2 of this Act are declared unconstitutional or their enforcement is restrained. Section 10. That chapter 22-17 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Nothing in the provisions of chapters 22-17 and 34-23A permit any action that is prohibited by this Act. To the extent that any provision of chapters 22-17 and 34-23A might be so construed, the provisions of this Act take precedence. Section 11. That chapter 22-17 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Nothing in this Act authorizes a physician to perform an abortion unless the physician complies with all other applicable provisions of law, including the applicable provisions of chapter 34-23A.
