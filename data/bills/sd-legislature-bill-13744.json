BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That chapter 1-16G be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: No person may receive a loan from the revolving economic development and initiative fund unless the person agrees, as a condition to receiving the loan, to pay to non-management employees a wage which averages at least ten dollars per hour to any employee whose job is considered to be the result of the loan. However, the Board of Economic Development may waive this wage requirement if: (1) The loan recipient would be operating a business and providing jobs in a rural area or a municipality with a population of five thousand or less; (2) The loan recipient would be operating a value-added processing facility which processes farm and ranch commodities; (3) The loan recipient would be providing jobs with an average wage below the wage requirement but above the prevailing wage paid within the local community; (4) The loan recipient would be providing jobs which have an average wage below the wage requirement but above the prevailing wage for the occupation as paid within the state; or (5) The loan recipient is a locally-owned business in a start-up phase that demonstrates the ability to pay higher wages once established. 750 copies of this document were printed by the South Dakota Legislative Research Council at a cost of $.016 per page. .
