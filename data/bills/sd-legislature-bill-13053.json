A restricted minor's permit entitles the holder, while having the permit in his immediate physical possession, to operate a motor vehicle during the hours of 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. standard time if the motor vehicle is being operated with the permission of the minor's parents or guardian and during the hours of 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. if the vehicle is being operated only on the most direct route between the operator's home and the school in which the operator is enrolled and is in session and with only members of the minor's family in the motor vehicle or on the most direct route between the operator's home and the operator's place of employment or in the course of employment. The holder of a restricted minor's permit may otherwise operate a motor vehicle only if the motor vehicle is being operated under the direction of the minor's parent or guardian who is occupying a seat beside the driver. The restrictions as to time of operation and operation under the direction of a parent or guardian do not apply to the holder of a valid restricted minor's permit operating a self-propelled agricultural machine which is not subject to registration under chapter 32-5. Section 2. That chapter 32-12 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: A minor's permit may be issued, upon application and payment of the proper fee as provided for in \u00a7 32-12-16, upon successful completion of an approved driver's education training program and upon passage of all driver's license examination tests, to a minor at least fifteen years of age if the applicant for a minor's permit has not received a citation for a moving violation during the past six months while holding or eligible to hold a restricted minor's permit.

A minor's permit entitles the holder, while having the permit in immediate physical possession, to operate a motor vehicle anytime of the day or night if the motor vehicle is being operated under the direction of the minor's parent or guardian who is occupying a seat beside the driver. The restrictions as to time of operation and operation under the direction of a parent or guardian do not apply to the holder of a valid minor's permit operating a self-propelled agricultural machine which is not subject to registration under chapter 32-5. Section 3.
