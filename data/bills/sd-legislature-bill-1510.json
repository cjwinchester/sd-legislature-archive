Any person who has been convicted for commission of a sex crime, as defined in \u00a7 22-24B-1, shall register as a sex offender. The term, convicted, includes a verdict or plea of guilty, a plea of nolo contendere, and a suspended imposition of sentence which has not been discharged pursuant to \u00a7 23A-27-14 prior to July 1, 1995. Any juvenile fifteen years or older shall register as a sex offender if that juvenile has been adjudicated of a sex crime as defined in \u00a7 22-22-7.2, 22-24B-1(1), or 22-24B-1(9), or of an out-of-state or federal offense that is comparable to the elements of these three sex crimes or any crime committed in another state if the state also requires a juvenile adjudicated of that crime to register as a sex offender in that state. The term, adjudicated, includes a court's finding of delinquency, an admission, and a suspended adjudication of delinquency which has not been discharged pursuant to \u00a7 26-8C-4 prior to July 1, 2009. The sex offender shall register within five three business days of coming into any county to reside, temporarily domicile, attend school, attend postsecondary education classes, or work. Registration shall be with the chief of police of the municipality in which the sex offender resides, temporarily domiciles, attends school, attends postsecondary education classes, or works, or, if no chief of police exists, then with the sheriff of the county. If the sex offender is not otherwise registered in the state, the sex offender shall register within five three business days of coming into any county when the sex offender applies for or receives a South Dakota driver license, registers a motor vehicle, establishes a postal address, or registers to vote. A violation of this section is a Class 6 felony. Any person whose sentence is discharged under \u00a7 23A-27-14 after July 1, 1995, shall forward a certified copy of such formal discharge by certified mail to the Division of Criminal Investigation and to local law enforcement where the person is then registered under this section. Upon receipt of such notice, the person shall be removed from the sex offender registry open to public inspection and shall be relieved of further registration requirements under this section. Any juvenile whose suspended adjudication is discharged under \u00a7 26-8C-4 after July 1, 2009, shall forward a certified copy of the formal discharge by certified mail to the Division of Criminal Investigation and to local law enforcement where the juvenile is then registered under this section. Upon receipt of the notice, the juvenile shall be removed from the sex offender registry open to public inspection and shall be relieved of further registration requirements under this section. Section 2. That \u00a7 22-24B-6 be amended to read as follows: 22-24B-6. Any person who is registered as required by \u00a7 22-24B-2 and who is employed, carries on a vocation, or attends postsecondary classes at an institution of higher education, institution of higher learning, or technical institute in this state shall, within five three business days of any commencement and within five three business days of termination of such enrollment or employment or change in employer, report to the chief of police or county sheriff where the institution is located and complete a registration update form. A violation of this section is a Class 6 felony. Section 3. That \u00a7 22-24B-30 be amended to read as follows: 22-24B-30.

The Department of Corrections or administering authority of the county or city jail or juvenile detention center shall submit required sex offender registrations to the Division of Criminal Investigation. The administering authority of the correctional facility shall notify the Division of Criminal Investigation if a person required to register changes status from an inmate to parolee or probationer or if an inmate is transferred to a different address, informing the division of the date of transfer and address of the new location. Section 4. That \u00a7 22-24B-31 be amended to read as follows: 22-24B-31. Any person with a foreign criminal conviction, which requires the person to register either as a sex offender pursuant to \u00a7 22-24B-2, pursuant to the laws of the state where the conviction took place, or pursuant to any court order, shall be required to register within five three business days of their arrival in South Dakota. A violation of this section is a Class 4 felony. Section 5.
