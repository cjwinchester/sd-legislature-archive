Upon receipt of an application under section 4 of this Act, in approved form, the county treasurer shall enter the application upon the records of its office and issue to the applicant a registration stating the number awarded to the boat and two validation decals. The registration shall state the name and address of the owner. The owner shall attach to each side of the bow of the boat the boat number assigned and validation decal as prescribed by rules of the department so they are clearly visible.

The temporary boat license tags shall be displayed as required by section 5 of this Act and rules promulgated, pursuant to chapter 1-26, by the department. Section 11. A boat is not required to be numbered under this Act if it is: (1) A boat covered by a number still in effect which was awarded pursuant to federal law or a federally approved numbering system of another state and the boat has not been in this state for more than sixty consecutive days and has not been berthed for a contract period of more than sixty days in marina facilities controlled by this state; (2) A boat from a country other than the United States temporarily using the waters of this state; (3) A boat whose owner is the United States, a state or subdivision thereof; (4) A racing boat competing in a regatta or boat race approved by the Game, Fish and Parks Commission or operating during a period not to exceed forty-eight hours immediately preceding the race and the remainder of the race day.

The transfer, destruction, or abandonment terminates the certificate of number for the boat, except that in the case of a transfer of a part interest which does not affect the owner's right to operate the boat, the transfer does not terminate the certificate of number. A violation of this section is a petty offense. Section 13. If one of the validation decals or the registration is lost, the owner of a boat numbered under this Act shall apply for replacement of the lost validation decal or registration. The fee for replacement of the registration is two dollars and the fee for a replacement set of validation decals is two dollars.

Section 17. No number other than the number awarded to a boat or granted reciprocity pursuant to this Act may be attached on either side of the bow of the boat. A violation of this section is a Class 2 misdemeanor. Section 18.

Section 20. Nothing in this Act prevents the adoption of any ordinance or local law relating to operation of boats, the provisions of which are identical to the provisions of this Act or rules promulgated pursuant to this Act. However, any ordinance or local law shall be operative only so long as and to the extent that it is identical to provisions of this Act or rules promulgated pursuant to this Act. Section 21. This section and sections 22 to 33, inclusive, of this Act apply to large boats which are purchased or acquired by residents of this state on and after March 1, 1992. Any resident of this state who purchases or acquires a large boat shall apply to the county treasurer of such person's residence for a certificate of title for the large boat. Section 22. Each owner of a large boat subject to titling under this Act shall apply to the county treasurer for issuance of a certificate of title for the large boat within thirty days after acquisition. The application shall be on forms the department prescribes, and accompanied by the certificate of title or other acceptable ownership document previously issued for the boat if the boat is used or the manufacturer's statement of origin if the boat is new, a bill of sale and the required fee. The application shall contain the date of sale and purchase price of the large boat or the fair market value if no sale immediately preceded the transfer, and any additional information the department requires. If the application is made for a large boat last previously registered or titled in another state or foreign country, it shall contain this information and any other information the department requires. Section 23. If a dealer buys or acquires a used large boat for resale, the dealer may apply for and obtain a certificate of title as provided in section 22 of this Act.

If a dealer buys or acquires a new large boat for resale, the dealer may apply for a certificate of title in the dealer's name. Section 24. Any boat dealer or motor vehicle dealer licensed pursuant to chapter 32-6B transferring a large boat requiring titling under this Act shall assign the title to the new owner, or in the case of a new large boat, the boat dealer shall assign the manufacturer's certificate of origin to the new owner. Within thirty days the applicant shall forward all title fees and applications to the county treasurer. Section 25. No person may sell, assign, or transfer a large boat titled by the state without delivering to the purchaser or transferee a certificate of title with an assignment on it showing title in the purchaser or transferee.

The county treasurer shall charge a five dollar fee for issuance of a certificate of title, a transfer of title, or a corrected certificate of title. If a certificate of title is lost, stolen, mutilated, destroyed, or becomes illegible, the owner named in the certificate shall obtain a duplicate by applying to the county register of deeds. The applicant shall furnish information the department requires concerning the original certificate and the circumstances of its loss, mutilation or destruction. Mutilated or illegible certificates shall be returned to the department with the application for a duplicate. The duplicate certificate of title shall be marked plainly \"duplicate\" and mailed or delivered to the applicant or as otherwise directed by the owner. If a lost or stolen original certificate of title for which a duplicate has been issued is recovered, the original shall be surrendered promptly to the department for cancellation. A fee of ten dollars shall be paid to the department for each duplicate title issued. Section 27. No manufacturer or boat dealer may transfer ownership of a new large boat without supplying the transferee with the manufacturer's or importer's certificate of origin signed by the manufacturer's or importer's authorized agent. The certificate shall contain information the department requires. No boat dealer may purchase or acquire a new large boat without obtaining from the seller a manufacturer's statement of origin. Any person who does not comply with this section is guilty of a Class 2 misdemeanor. Section 28. Any boat whose construction began after October 31, 1972, shall have a hull identification number assigned and affixed as required by the federal Boat Safety Act of 1971. The department shall by rules promulgated pursuant to chapter 1-26, establish the procedures for application and for issuance of the hull identification number for homebuilt boats. No person may destroy, remove, alter, cover, or deface the manufacturer's hull identification number, the plate bearing it, or any hull identification number the department assigns to a boat without the department's permission. A person other than a manufacturer who constructs a large boat or uses an unconventional device as a large boat for navigation shall submit an affidavit which describes the large boat or device to the department. In cooperation with the county treasurer, the department shall assign a hull identification number to the large boat or device. The applicant shall cause the number to be carved, burned, stamped, embossed, or otherwise permanently affixed to the outboard side of the transom or, if there is no transom, to the outermost starboard side at the end of the hull that bears the rudder or other steering mechanism, above the waterline of the boat or device in such a way that alteration, removal, or replacement would be obvious and evident. Section 29. A dealer shall maintain for five years a record of any large boat bought, sold, exchanged, or received for sale or exchange. This record shall be open to inspection by department representatives during reasonable business hours. Section 30. If ownership of a large boat is transferred by operation of law, by inheritance, order in bankruptcy, insolvency, replevin, or execution sale, the transferee, within thirty days after acquiring the right to possession of the large boat, shall mail or deliver to the county treasurer satisfactory proof of ownership as the department requires, together with an application for a new certificate of title, and the required fee. If a lienholder repossesses a large boat and holds it for resale, the lienholder shall secure a new certificate of title and shall pay the required fee. Section 31. A security interest created in this state in a large boat on and after March 1, 1992, is not perfected until the security interest is noted on the certificate of title. On or after July 1, 1993, a security interest created in this state on a large boat exclusive of a motorboat is not perfected until the security interest is noted on the certificate of title. On or after July 1, 1994, a security interest created in this state on a large boat is not perfected until the security interest is noted on the certificate of title. To perfect the security interest, a copy of the security agreement shall be presented along with the original title. The register of deeds, or the seller, buyer, owner, or holder of the instrument shall note the security interest at any place on the instrument, and if so noted, the lien is perfected against the creditors of the debtor, is valid against the creditors of the debtor, whether armed with process or not, and subsequent purchasers and other lien holders or claimants, but otherwise is not valid against them. The fee for noting the lien is five dollars. The fees shall be credited to the county general fund. The certificate of title shall be presented to the county register of deeds if a lien is to be noted on an existing certificate of title. The owner shall present the certificate of title to the county register of deeds when a release statement is filed. Section 32. The department shall prescribe and provide suitable forms for applications, certificate of title, notices of security interests, and all other notices and forms necessary to implement sections 21 to 33, inclusive, of this Act. Section 33. The owner of a large boat not yet subject to the titling requirements of this Act, may apply to the county treasurer of the owner's residence for a certificate of title for the large boat. The application shall be accompanied by proof of ownership and a certificate issued by the secretary of state that there are or are not liens of record encumbering the large boat. If there are one or more liens on the large boat, the department shall note the liens on the certificate of title in order of their priority and shall deliver or mail the certificate of title to the owner or as otherwise directed by the owners. Upon issuance of the certificate of title for the large boat, the large boat shall thereafter be subject to the requirements of this Act, as though the boat was required to be titled. The owner shall present the certificate of title to the county register of deeds when a release statement is filed and a new or endorsed certificate shall be issued to the owner. Section 34. The secretary of the department may adopt rules, promulgated pursuant to chapter 1-26, to establish uniform procedures for the administration of the titling of large boats and registration and numbering of boats for the following areas: (1) Application requirements for the registration and titling of boats, assignment of certificate of title, certificate of title for boats previously registered, time limits for making application, duplicate certificates and transfer of certificate, lien recording, assignment of liens, execution of cancellation of liens, delivery of title, abandoned, repossessed and operation by law; and (2) Issuance, display, inspection, expiration, cancellation, and removal of certificates of number and boat identification tags. Violation of a rule adopted pursuant to this section is a Class 2 misdemeanor. Section 35. No boat may be registered in this state until all of the requirements of this Act have been met. A certificate of title shall be applied for at the time of registration for any large boat. Section 36. The secretary may, upon the completion of an application for a title, payment of the title fee and surrender of evidence of ownership by an applicant, issue a certificate of title, indicating no tax paid, for a large boat if the applicant certifies on the application that the large boat is not going to be used upon the waters of this state or any other state. If a no tax paid title is issued, the applicant may not use the large boat upon the waters of this state. Section 37. Any person who is an owner of a boat who is required to apply for title or registration, or both, and whose legal residence or chief place of business is outside the state, shall submit an application, a copy of a valid title if from a title issuing state from another jurisdiction or other form of ownership acceptable to the department and payment of all applicable fees to the county treasurer. Upon receipt of such information, the county treasurer shall issue a nonnegotiable interstate title. A nonnegotiable title is not a valid legal document for any purpose or transaction except to make application for yearly South Dakota registration. The nonnegotiable title is valid as long as title ownership remains the same. Failure to apply for a title as provided by this section is a Class 2 misdemeanor. Section 38. The county treasurer shall forward each nonnegotiable interstate title to the department with the application for registration, a copy of the valid ownership document or out-of-state registration. The department shall determine if such documents were valid at the time of application for registration. Section 39. The department may upon written request and receipt of a five dollar fee furnish a person a certified abstract of the title history of any boat registered under the provisions of this Act. The abstract may include all documents filed with the department to establish the title history of the boat. The fee shall be deposited in the state motor vehicle fund. Governmental entities and their subdivisions are exempt from this fee requirement. Section 40. A person, in possession of a title either in the person's name or assigned to the person or a bill of sale which lists the person as a purchaser of the boat, may procure from any county treasurer a temporary permit which allows use of the boat in South Dakota waters. The title or bill of sale shall be available for inspection by any law enforcement officer if the boat is being used. The permit may be purchased for any period from five to fifteen consecutive days at a fee of one dollar per day for each day the permit is required. The minimum permit fee is five dollars. The fee is payable to the county treasurer at the time of purchase. All permit fees shall be forwarded monthly by the county treasurer to the department. The fee shall be deposited in the state motor vehicle fund. Only one permit may be issued yearly for each boat. Section 41. If ownership of a large boat is being transferred, the application for certificate of title shall be filed within thirty days after the date of assignment or acquisition of the large boat. However, a boat dealer need not apply for a certificate of title on any large boat held in stock or acquired for stock purposes unless otherwise required under this Act. Upon transfer of the large boat, the boat dealer shall give the transferee a reassignment of the certificate of title or the manufacturer's statement of origin. Section 42. If application for certificate of title is presented more than thirty days after date of assignment of title or acquisition of the large boat if no title exists or more than thirty days after assignment of the manufacturer's statement of origin, the officer receiving the application shall collect, in addition to the regular established fees, a late fee of one dollar for each week or fraction thereof beyond the thirty-day limitation for twenty-five weeks and a late fee of fifty dollars for twenty-six weeks or more. Any person applying for a title twenty-six weeks beyond the thirty-day limitation is guilty of a Class 2 misdemeanor. Section 43. Any person who knowingly makes a false statement of a material fact, either on the application for certificate of title provided for in this Act, or in any assignment thereof, is guilty of a Class 5 felony. Section 44. Any person who alters or forges, or causes to be altered or forged, any certificate of title issued by the State of South Dakota pursuant to the provisions of this Act, or any assignment thereof, or any person who shall hold or use any such certificate or assignment knowing the same to have been altered or forged, is guilty of a Class 6 felony. Section 45. The burden of proving ownership and title is upon the applicant for a certificate of title. If satisfied that the applicant is the owner of the large boat and the application is in proper form, the secretary of revenue shall issue a certificate of title. Section 46. The county register of deeds, upon receipt of a lien or title instrument duly executed in the manner prescribed by law governing such instruments, together with the fee prescribed for notation thereof which is nonrefundable, shall notify the holder of the certificate of title to deliver to the county register of deeds, within fifteen days from the date of notice, the certificate of title to permit notation of the lien, and if necessary, the issuance of a new certificate of title. After the notation of the lien, the county register of deeds shall deliver the certificate of title to the owner or as otherwise directed by the owner. The secured party shall be mailed or delivered notification of the party's security interest as filed and noted on the certificate of title. The holder of the certificate of title who refuses to deliver the certificate of title to the county register of deeds for purposes of showing the lien on the certificate of title within fifteen days from the date notified to do so by the county register of deeds is liable for damages to the lien holder for the amount of damage the lien holder suffered by reason of the holder of the certificate of title refusing to permit the showing of the lien on the certificate of title. Section 47. If a lien is discharged, the lien holder shall execute a release, which shall contain the certificate of title number and the date of the notation, within twenty days after the final payment is received. The lien holder shall deliver the release and certificate of title if held by the holder to any county register of deeds who shall note the cancellation of the lien on the face of the certificate of title, and on the same day shall notify the secretary, who shall cancel the lien on the state's computer system, if the county register of deeds has not done so. If the certificate of title is lost as set forth in \u00a7 32-3-29, application for duplicate title may be forwarded along with the release to the department, which shall cancel the lien. Upon the satisfaction of a security interest on a large boat for which the certificate of title is in the possession of the owner, the secured party shall within twenty days after final payment is received, execute a release of security interest on the form prescribed by the department and mail or deliver such release to the owner or as otherwise directed by the owner. Section 48. Except as otherwise provided in this Act, each large boat certificate of title, upon transfer of ownership, shall contain a complete record showing the chain of title of the large boat from the owner named on the front of the title to and including the applicant presenting the same as evidence of ownership and applying for a new certificate of title. Section 49. The register of deeds and the county treasurer shall assist in the administration of this Act and perform any duties in connection therewith as may be required by the secretary. Section 50. If the secretary finds that an applicant for a certificate of title or registration of a boat is not entitled to the certificate or registration, under the provisions of this Act the secretary may refuse to issue a certificate or to register the boat, and may for a like reason, and after notice and hearing, revoke title, license and registration already acquired. The notice shall be served in person or by registered or certified mail. Section 51. In addition to all other fees, a person shall pay an excise tax at the rate of three percent on the purchase price of any large boat, purchased or acquired for use on the waters of this state and required to be registered under the laws of this state. This tax shall be in lieu of any tax levied by chapters 10-45 and 10-46 on the sale of any large boat. Failure to pay the full amount of excise tax is a Class 1 misdemeanor. Section 52. For purposes of this excise tax as provided by section 51 of this Act, the term, large boat, means any boat defined as a large boat by this Act and its accompanying motor. Section 53. Exempt from the excise tax are: (1) Any large boat which is the property of the governmental units which are exempted from motor vehicle registration fees by \u00a7 \u00a7 32-5-42 and 32-5-42.1; (2) Any large boat acquired by inheritance from or bequest of a decedent; (3) Any large boat previously titled or licensed jointly in the names of two or more persons and subsequently transferred without consideration to one or more of such persons; (4) Any large boat transferred without consideration between spouses, between a parent and child, and between siblings; (5) Any large boat transferred pursuant to any merger or consolidation of corporations or plans of reorganization by which substantially all of the assets of a corporation are transferred if the large boat was previously titled, licensed, and registered in this state; (6) Any large boat transferred by a subsidiary corporation to its parent corporation for no or nominal consideration or in sole consideration of the cancellation or surrender of the subsidiary's stock if the large boat was previously titled, licensed, and registered in this state; (7) Any large boat transferred between an individual and a corporation if the individual and the owner of the majority of the capital stock of the corporation are one and the same and if the large boat was previously titled and registered in this state; (8) Any large boat transferred between a corporation and its stockholders or creditors if to effectuate a dissolution of the corporation it is necessary to transfer the title from the corporate entity to the stockholders or creditors and if the large boat was previously titled and registered in this state; (9) Any large boat transferred between an individual and limited or general partnership if the individual and the owner of the majority interest in the partnership are one and the same person and if the large boat was previously titled and registered in this state; (10) Any large boat transferred to effect a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the business entity if the large boat was previously titled and registered in this state; (11) Any large boat acquired by a secured party or lien holder in satisfaction of a debt; (12) Any large boat sold or transferred which is eleven or more years old and which is sold or transferred for one thousand five hundred dollars or less before trade-in; (13) Any damaged large boat transferred to an insurance company in the settlement of an insurance claim; (14) Any large boat owned by a former resident of this state who returns to the state and who had previously paid excise tax to this state on the large boat as evidenced within the department's records or by submission of other acceptable proof of payment of such tax; (15) Any large boat transferred between corporations, both subsidiary and nonsubsidiary, if the individuals who hold a majority of stock in the first corporation also hold a majority of stock in the second corporation; but these individuals need not hold the same ratio of stock in both corporations provided the large boat was previously titled and registered in this state; and (16) Any large boat transferred by a trustor to the person's trustee or from a trustee to a beneficiary of a trust. Section 54. For the purposes of this Act, the purchase price is: (1) For a new large boat, the total consideration whether received in money or otherwise. However, if a large boat is taken in trade as a credit or part payment on a new large boat, the credit or trade-in value allowed by the seller shall be deducted from the total consideration for the new large boat to establish the purchase price; (2) For a used large boat sold or transferred by a dealer, the total consideration for the used large boat whether received in money or otherwise. However, if a large boat is taken in trade by the dealer as a credit or part payment on a used large boat, the credit or trade-in value allowed by the dealer shall be deducted from the consideration so that the net consideration is established; (3) For a used large boat sold or transferred by any person other than a dealer, the total consideration received in money or otherwise. However, if a large boat is taken in trade as a credit or part payment on a used large boat, the credit or trade-in value shall be deducted from the total consideration so that the net consideration is established. The purchaser and seller of the large boat shall submit to the county treasurer a bill of sale, approved and supplied by the secretary. If a bill of sale is not submitted, the excise tax shall be assessed on the retail value as stated in a nationally recognized dealers' guide as approved by the secretary of revenue. If the excise tax is assessed on the retail value, the value of the large boat taken in as credit on trade-in shall be the retail value as stated in the nationally recognized dealers' guide; (4) For a new or used large boat acquired by gift or other transfer for no or nominal consideration, the manufacturers' suggested dealer list price for new large boats and for used large boats the retail value stated in a nationally recognized dealers' guide approved and furnished by the secretary of revenue; (5) For a large boat manufactured by a person who registers it under the laws of this state, the amount expended for materials, labor and other properly allocable costs of manufacture or in the absence of actual expenditures for the manufacture of a part or all of the large boat, the reasonable value of the completed large boat; and (6) For a rebuilt large boat, upon its initial registration and titling, the total consideration for the salvage large boat, whether received in money or otherwise. Section 55. On a used large boat, the county treasurer shall, for the purpose of this Act, use the most generally used and approved nationally recognized dealers' guide provided by the secretary of revenue. If the large boat is not covered by the provided dealers' guide, the county treasurer shall seek assistance from the department. The secretary of revenue shall file notice of approved national dealer or appraisal guides with the secretary of state indicating the effective date of such approval. Such filing is not subject to chapter 1-26. Section 56. The new owner of a large boat shall present to the county treasurer in the county of the owner's residence the manufacturer's statement of origin or assigned certificate of title if a title has been previously issued for the large boat, an application for title and registration and a bill of sale containing a complete description of the large boat, the purchaser's name and address, the previous owner's name and address, the full purchase price as defined by this Act and how computed, the trade-in allowance and description of the trade, if any, and any other relevant information the department may require. If a person intentionally falsifies information on the certificate, the person is guilty of a Class 6 felony. Section 57. The excise tax levied by this Act shall be paid to the county treasurer in the county of the new owner's residence when the owner applies for title and registers the large boat. Section 58. If any boat has been subjected previously to a sales tax, use tax, excise tax, or similar tax by this or any other state or its political subdivision, no tax is owed to this state if the tax has been paid by the applicant to this or any other state.
