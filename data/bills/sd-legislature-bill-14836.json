A new license to replace a lost, destroyed, or mutilated license shall be issued upon payment of a fee established by the board pursuant to chapter 1-26. Section 38. The recipient of a license issued under this Act may practice engineering, architecture, land surveying, landscape architecture, petroleum release assessment, or petroleum release remediation and use the appropriate title professional engineer, architect, land surveyor, landscape architect, petroleum release assessor, or petroleum release remediator. A licensee may use a title either with or without prefixing the word, licensed or registered. No licensee may practice a profession or use a title unless the license specifically permits such practice and usage. An unrevoked and unexpired license issued as provided in this Act is presumptive evidence in all courts and places that the person named is legally licensed. Section 39. A license expires two years after the date of issuance and becomes invalid on that date unless renewed by that date. Any professional engineer, architect, land surveyor, landscape architect, or petroleum release assessor or remediator licensed under this Act who desires to continue to practice or offer to practice the licensee's profession shall: (1) Pay the renewal fee established by the board in rules promulgated pursuant to chapter 1-26; and (2) Successfully complete all continuing professional development requirements established by the board or make a showing of good cause why the licensee was unable to comply with such requirements.

A license for a two-year period shall be issued upon completion of the requirements. The board may provide, by rules promulgated pursuant to chapter 1-26, for the inactive or retired status of a person who has been duly licensed under this Act and who chooses to relinquish or not to renew a license. Section 41. The board shall notify by mail any person licensed under this Act of the date of expiration of the license, the requirement of professional development hours, and the amount of the fee required for renewal. The notice shall be mailed to the last known address of the licensee at least one month in advance of the date of expiration of the license. A licensee shall notify the board of any address changes. Section 42. A person may reinstate an expired license or request inactive status within three years after a license's date of expiration if the person is otherwise qualified. The fee for the reinstatement of the license or requesting inactive status after it has expired shall be increased by an amount to be determined by the board in rules promulgated pursuant to chapter 1-26. A person requesting reinstatement of an expired or inactive license shall complete the requirements for continuing professional development and any re-examinations and pay any penalty fees. If a person fails to reinstate an expired license or request inactive status within the three years after the date of expiration, all relevant files shall be deleted. A person requesting licensure after three years shall submit an application for a new license. Section 43. Any licensed person may request that the person's license be placed on inactive or retired status. A fee to place files on inactive or retired status shall be determined by the board in rules promulgated pursuant to chapter 1-26. Failure to render any fees required for inactive or retired status shall result in the automatic termination of inactive or retired status. The request for files to be placed on inactive or retired status may be denied by the board. No person may practice or offer to practice while that person's files are inactive or retired. Section 44. Any licensed professional engineer, architect, land surveyor, and landscape architect shall procure and use an appropriate seal. The seal shall contain the following information: (1) The name, South Dakota; (2) Licensee's name; (3) License number; and (4) The appropriate title or combination of titles: Professional Engineer, Architect, Land Surveyor, Landscape Architect.

The licensee's original written signature and the date shall be adjacent to or across the seal. Computer-generated or other facsimile signatures and dates may not be used. Petroleum release assessors and remediators, or interns, may not obtain or use any seal. Section 45. The application of the licensee's seal and signature and the date constitutes certification that the work on which it was applied was done by the licensee or under the licensee's responsible charge. The seal, signature, and date shall be placed in such a manner that can be legibly reproduced on the following: (1) All originals, copies, tracings, or other reproducibles of all final drawings, specifications, reports, plats, plans, land surveys, design information, and calculations prepared by the licensee or under the licensee's responsible charge when presented to a client or any public or governmental agency.

The electronic media shall have the following inserted in lieu of the seal, signature, and date: This document originally issued and sealed by (name of licensee/sealer), (title), (license number), on (date of sealing). This media should not be considered a certified document. Section 46. No person other than an architect or professional engineer may provide architectural and engineering services which include construction administration services on projects that are not exempt pursuant to sections 2 and 3 of this Act. The architect or professional engineer of record, or another designated architect or professional engineer without conflict of interest, shall provide a written report of observed deficiencies or variations from the submitted plans and specifications to the building official, owner, and builder before project completion. The board may promulgate rules pursuant to chapter 1-26 to establish construction administration services criteria including coordinating and prime professional criteria. Section 47. Any office physically located and maintained in this state to offer engineering, architectural, land surveying, landscape architectural, petroleum release assessment, or petroleum release remediation services shall have an appropriately licensed person who is regularly employed in that office and who has responsible charge and direct supervision and control of all professional services. A licensee who renders occasional, part-time, or consulting services to or for a firm or office may not be designated as the person in responsible charge for the professional activities of the firm or office unless a schedule is posted at the office for the public's knowledge and filed with and approved by the board stating when the licensee is physically in the office. Section 48. Any business entity that desires to practice engineering, architecture, land surveying, landscape architecture, or petroleum release assessment or remediation in this state shall register with the board by making application for a certificate of authorization. A business entity is responsible for the conduct or acts of its agents, employees, officers, partners, members, or managers in respect to any engineering, architecture, land surveying, landscape architecture, petroleum release assessment, or petroleum release remediation services performed or to be executed in this state. No person is relieved of the responsibility for that person's conduct or acts performed by reason of that person's employment by or relationship with a business entity.

The certificate of authorization is not transferable. Section 51. The business entity shall file with the board a written report of any change in the information submitted on the application that occurs during the term of the certificate of authorization. The business entity shall report the change within thirty days after the effective date of the change. Failure to provide the report constitutes grounds for the board to suspend or revoke the certificate of authorization. Section 52. The provisions with respect to issuance, expiration, renewal, and reissuance of the certificate of licensure of persons contained in this Act apply to certificates of authorization issued to business entities under the provisions of this Act. A business entity is subject to disciplinary proceedings and penalties, and certificates of authorization are subject to suspension or revocation for cause, in the same manner and to the same extent as is provided with respect to individuals and their certificates of licensure in this Act. The terms, licensee and certificate of licensure, as used in this Act, apply to any business entity holding a certificate of authorization issued under this Act and to such certificate of authorization. Section 53. A violation of any of the provisions of this Act by a business entity is not grounds for the revocation, suspension, or refusal to renew a license of an individual employee of the business entity unless the board finds that the employee was a party to the violation. Section 54. The board shall inquire into the identity of any person alleged to be engaging in the unlawful practice of engineering, architecture, land surveying, landscape architecture, petroleum release assessment, or petroleum release remediation. The board shall investigate alleged violations of the provisions of this Act, and report to the proper state's attorney any person or case that in the judgment of the board warrants prosecution. The attorney general and the several state's attorneys shall prosecute violations of this Act in the name or on behalf of the board. Section 55. When investigating alleged violations, the board may administer oaths to witnesses appearing before the board, subpoena witnesses and compel their attendance, and require the submittal of plans, specifications, books, records, papers, and other documents. If any person refuses to obey any subpoena, or refuses to testify or produce any materials required, the board may take disciplinary action or present its petition to the court of the county in which the person resides, and the court shall enter a suitable order compelling compliance with the provisions of this Act and imposing such other terms and conditions as the court may deem suitable.

Any person aggrieved by an order under this subdivision may make an appeal pursuant to chapter 1-26; (2) Injunction: If the board deems it necessary for the public safety, it may bring an action in the name of the state in the circuit court in any county in which jurisdiction is proper to enjoin the act, practice, or violation and to enforce compliance with this Act or any rule promulgated pursuant to this Act. Upon showing that a person has engaged in an otherwise unauthorized act or practice, a permanent or temporary injunction, or restraining order, or other appropriate relief shall be obtained against the person to prohibit the continuation of the unauthorized act or practice. If a person has caused a structure to be designed, constructed, or built by engaging in an unauthorized act or practice, a permanent or temporary injunction or restraining order, or other appropriate relief, shall be obtained against the project prohibiting the use and occupancy of any structure.

Unless otherwise agreed by the board and the person requesting the hearing, the hearing shall be held no later than ninety days after the request for the hearing is received by the board. Section 63. The board or administrative law judge shall issue a report within thirty days of the close of the contested case hearing record. Within thirty days after the report and any exceptions to it, the board shall issue a further order vacating, modifying, or making permanent the cease and desist orders as the facts require. Section 64. If no hearing is requested within the thirty days of service of the order, the order becomes final and remains in effect until it is modified or vacated by the board. If the person to whom a cease and desist order is issued fails to appear at the hearing after being duly notified, the person is in default and the proceeding may be determined against that person upon consideration of the cease and desist order, the allegations of which may be considered to be true. Action taken pursuant to this section does not relieve a person from criminal prosecution by a competent authority or from disciplinary action by the board with respect to the person's license, registration, certification, application for examination, or renewal. Section 65. No person may: (1) Practice, or offer to practice, the professions of engineering, architecture, land surveying, landscape architecture, petroleum release assessment, or petroleum release remediation in this state without being licensed or exempt in accordance with the provisions of this Act; (2) Use or employ the title of architect, landscape architect, land surveyor, professional engineer, petroleum release assessor, or petroleum release remediator with or without qualifying adjectives without being licensed in accordance with the provisions of this Act; (3) Use any other words, letters, or figures indicating or intending to imply that the person is a professional engineer, architect, land surveyor, landscape architect, petroleum release assessor, or petroleum release remediator without being licensed in accordance with the provision of this Act; (4) Present or attempt to use the certificate of licensure or seal of another, or affix a professional engineer's, architect's, land surveyor's, or landscape architect's seal on any plans, specifications, drawings, or other technical submittals which have not been prepared by that person or under that person's responsible charge and direct personal supervision; (5) Present any false or forged evidence of any kind to the board in obtaining a certificate of licensure; (6) Falsely impersonate any other licensee; (7) Attempt to use an expired, suspended, or revoked license; (8) Knowingly allow person's name or seal to be used upon plans or work not actually performed by that person or under that person's responsible charge and direct supervision; or (9) By act of commission or omission, violates any of the provisions of this Act.

The board may impose a fee to reimburse the board for all or part of the cost of proceedings resulting in disciplinary action authorized by this Act, the imposition of civil penalties, or the issuance of a cease and desist order. The fee may be imposed if the board shows a person has committed an act or engaged in unauthorized practice, including the unauthorized use of a title, words, figures, or signs implying licensure, or has violated a statute, rule or order of the board.

This section does not relieve a professional engineer, architect, land surveyor, landscape architect, petroleum release assessor, or petroleum release remediator from liability for that person's negligence in design work. Section 69. Any contract, written or oral, for engineering, architectural, land surveying, landscape architectural, petroleum release assessment, or petroleum release remediation services made by any person in violation of any provision of this Act is unenforceable as to such services. It is a complete defense to any action to enforce payment for any services, if the party contracting for services proves that the person rendering or offering to render services was not at the time such services were offered or rendered, legally authorized to contract for such services. Section 70. No public officer or employee, as defined in subdivisions 22-1-2(37) and (39), charged with the authority or responsibility of approving or accepting plans, specifications, plats, or any other technical submissions, may accept or approve such plans, specifications, plats, or technical submissions which have been prepared in violation of this Act. The building official shall require the owner to engage and designate an architect or professional engineer who shall act as the architect or professional engineer of record on projects that are not exempt.

The building official shall be notified in writing by the owner if the architect or professional engineer of record is changed or is unable to continue to perform the duties. The architect or professional engineer of record is responsible for reviewing and coordinating all submittal documents prepared by others, including deferred submittal items, for compatibility with the design of the building. A building permit issued with respect to technical submissions which do not conform with the requirements of this Act are invalid. Section 71. No register of deeds of any county may file or record any map, plat, survey, or other technical submissions within the definition of land surveying which does not have impressed thereon and affixed thereto the personal signature, seal, and date of a land surveyor by whom or under whose responsible charge and direct personal supervision the map, plat, survey, or other technical submissions were prepared. Section 72. The board may promulgate rules, pursuant to chapter 1-26, regarding procedures and standards for certifying those who perform environmental technical services relative to site assessment, remedial investigations, and corrective actions necessary to remediate water or soil contaminated with a regulated substance and to establish fees to support this activity. Procedures and requirements may be promulgated by rule for determining eligibility, denial, suspension, and revocation of certification.

A business entity is subject to disciplinary proceedings and penalties, and certificates of authorization are subject to suspension or revocation for cause, in the same manner and to the same extent as is provided with respect to individuals and their certificates of licensure in this Act. The terms, licensee and certificate of licensure, as used in this Act, apply to any business entity holding a certificate of authorization issued under this Act and to such certificate of authorization. Section 53. A violation of any of the provisions of this Act by a business entity is not grounds for the revocation, suspension, or refusal to renew a license of an individual employee of the business entity unless the board finds that the employee was a party to the violation. Section 54. The board shall inquire into the identity of any person alleged to be engaging in the unlawful practice of engineering, architecture, land surveying, photogrammetry, landscape architecture, petroleum release assessment, or petroleum release remediation. The board shall investigate alleged violations of the provisions of this Act, and report to the proper state's attorney or the attorney general any person or case that in the judgment of the board warrants prosecution. The attorney general or the several state's attorneys may prosecute violations of this Act in the name or on behalf of the board. Section 55. When investigating alleged violations, the board may administer oaths to witnesses appearing before the board, subpoena licensees as witnesses and compel their attendance, and require the submittal of plans, specifications, books, records, papers, and other documents. If a licensee refuses to obey any subpoena, or refuses to testify or produce any materials required, the board may take disciplinary action or present its petition to the court of the county in which the licensee resides, and the court may enter a suitable order compelling compliance with the provisions of this Act and imposing such other terms and conditions as the court may deem suitable. The board may also summon nonlicensees as witnesses and request their attendance, and request the submittal of plans, specifications, books, records, papers, and other documents. If a nonlicensee refuses to cooperate, testify, or produce any materials requested, the board may petition the court of the county in which the nonlicensee resides, and the court may enter a suitable order compelling compliance with the provisions of this Act and imposing such other terms and conditions as the court may deem suitable.

A licensee may use a title either with or without prefixing the word, licensed or registered. No licensee may practice a profession or use a title unless the license specifically permits such practice and usage. An unrevoked and unexpired license issued as provided in this Act is presumptive evidence in all courts and places that the person named is legally licensed. Section 39. A license expires two years after the date of issuance and becomes invalid on that date unless renewed by that date. Any professional engineer, architect, land surveyor, landscape architect, or petroleum release assessor or remediator licensed under this Act who desires to continue to practice or offer to practice the licensee's profession shall: (1) Pay the renewal fee established by the board in rules promulgated pursuant to chapter 1-26; and (2) Successfully complete all continuing professional development requirements established by the board or make a showing of good cause why the licensee was unable to comply with such requirements.

Section 41. The board shall notify by mail any person licensed under this Act of the date of expiration of the license, the requirement of professional development hours, and the amount of the fee required for renewal. The notice shall be mailed to the last known address of the licensee at least one month in advance of the date of expiration of the license. A licensee shall notify the board of any address changes. Section 42. A person may reinstate an expired license or request inactive status within three years after a license's date of expiration if the person is otherwise qualified. The fee for the reinstatement of the license or requesting inactive status after it has expired shall be increased by an amount to be determined by the board in rules promulgated pursuant to chapter 1-26. A person requesting reinstatement of an expired or inactive license shall complete the requirements for continuing professional development and any reexaminations and pay any penalty fees. If a person fails to reinstate an expired license or request inactive status within the three years after the date of expiration, all relevant files shall be deleted. A person requesting licensure after three years shall submit an application for a new license. Section 43. Any licensed person may request that the person's license be placed on inactive or retired status. A fee to place files on inactive or retired status shall be determined by the board in rules promulgated pursuant to chapter 1-26. Failure to render any fees required for inactive or retired status shall result in the automatic termination of inactive or retired status. The request for files to be placed on inactive or retired status may be denied by the board. No person may practice or offer to practice while that person's files are inactive or retired. Section 44. Any licensed professional engineer, architect, land surveyor, and landscape architect shall procure and use an appropriate seal.

The licensee's original written signature and the date shall be adjacent to or across the seal. Computer-generated or other facsimile signatures and dates may not be used. Petroleum release assessors and remediators, or interns, may not obtain or use any seal. Section 45. The application of the licensee's seal and signature and the date constitutes certification that the work on which it was applied was done by the licensee or under the licensee's responsible charge. The seal, signature, and date shall be placed in such a manner that can be legibly reproduced on the following: (1) All originals, copies, tracings, or other reproducibles of all final drawings, specifications, reports, plats, plans, land surveys, design information, and calculations prepared by the licensee or under the licensee's responsible charge when presented to a client or any public or governmental agency. A licensee may not review or check technical submissions of another licensed professional or unlicensed person and seal the documents as the licensee's own work; (2) Preliminary work shall contain a note that the submittal is Not for Construction, Preliminary, or other such explanation that it is not final; (3) In the case of multiple seals, the title or index sheet may be sealed, signed, and dated by all involved.

The electronic media shall have the following inserted in lieu of the seal, signature, and date: This document originally issued and sealed by (name of licensee/sealer), (title), (license number), on (date of sealing). This media should not be considered a certified document. Section 46. No person other than an architect or professional engineer may provide architectural and engineering services which include construction administration services on projects that are not exempt pursuant to sections 2 and 3 of this Act. The architect or professional engineer of record, or another designated architect or professional engineer without conflict of interest, shall provide a written report of observed deficiencies or variations from the submitted plans and specifications to the building official, owner, and builder before project completion. The board may promulgate rules pursuant to chapter 1-26 to establish construction administration services criteria including coordinating and prime professional criteria for persons licensed by the board. Section 47. Any office physically located and maintained in this state to offer engineering, architectural, land surveying, landscape architectural, petroleum release assessment, or petroleum release remediation services shall have an appropriately licensed person who is regularly employed in that office and who has responsible charge and direct supervision and control of all professional services. A licensee who renders occasional, part-time, or consulting services to or for a firm or office may not be designated as the person in responsible charge for the professional activities of the firm or office unless a schedule is posted at the office for the public's knowledge and filed with and approved by the board stating when the licensee is physically in the office. Section 48. Any business entity that desires to practice engineering, architecture, land surveying, landscape architecture, or petroleum release assessment or remediation in this state shall register with the board by making application for a certificate of authorization. A business entity is responsible for the conduct or acts of its agents, employees, officers, partners, members, or managers in respect to any engineering, architecture, land surveying, landscape architecture, petroleum release assessment, or petroleum release remediation services performed or to be executed in this state. No person is relieved of the responsibility for that person's conduct or acts performed by reason of that person's employment by or relationship with a business entity. A licensee who renders occasional, part-time, or consulting services to or for a business entity may not be designated as the person in responsible charge for the professional activities of the business entity.

Section 50. The board shall issue a certificate of authorization or a renewal to a business entity upon receipt of an application for a certificate of authorization and a fee as set by the board pursuant to chapter 1-26 unless the board finds an error in the application or that any facts exist which would entitle the board to suspend or revoke the certificate if issued to the applicant. The certificate of authorization is not transferable. Section 51. The business entity shall file with the board a written report of any change in the information submitted on the application that occurs during the term of the certificate of authorization. The business entity shall report the change within thirty days after the effective date of the change. Failure to provide the report constitutes grounds for the board to suspend or revoke the certificate of authorization. Section 52. The provisions with respect to issuance, expiration, renewal, and reissuance of the certificate of licensure of persons contained in this Act apply to certificates of authorization issued to business entities under the provisions of this Act. A business entity is subject to disciplinary proceedings and penalties, and certificates of authorization are subject to suspension or revocation for cause, in the same manner and to the same extent as is provided with respect to individuals and their certificates of licensure in this Act. The terms, licensee and certificate of licensure, as used in this Act, apply to any business entity holding a certificate of authorization issued under this Act and to such certificate of authorization. Section 53.

Section 54. The board shall inquire into the identity of any person alleged to be engaging in the unlawful practice of engineering, architecture, land surveying, landscape architecture, petroleum release assessment, or petroleum release remediation. The board shall investigate alleged violations of the provisions of this Act, and report to the proper state's attorney or the attorney general any person or case that in the judgment of the board warrants prosecution. The attorney general or the several state's attorneys may prosecute violations of this Act in the name or on behalf of the board. Section 55. When investigating alleged violations, the board may administer oaths to witnesses appearing before the board, subpoena licensees as witnesses and compel their attendance, and require the submittal of plans, specifications, books, records, papers, and other documents. If a licensee refuses to obey any subpoena, or refuses to testify or produce any materials required, the board may take disciplinary action or present its petition to the court of the county in which the licensee resides, and the court may enter a suitable order compelling compliance with the provisions of this Act and imposing such other terms and conditions as the court may deem suitable. The board may also summon nonlicensees as witnesses and request their attendance, and request the submittal of plans, specifications, books, records, papers, and other documents. If a nonlicensee refuses to cooperate, testify, or produce any materials requested, the board may petition the court of the county in which the nonlicensee resides, and the court may enter a suitable order compelling compliance with the provisions of this Act and imposing such other terms and conditions as the court may deem suitable.

The findings and actions of the board on disciplinary matters shall be subject to appeal as provided by chapter 1-26 and rules promulgated pursuant to this Act. Section 61. Any person who has violated any provision of this Act or any rule promulgated pursuant to this Act, is subject to the following penalties: (1) Administrative fine: (a) Licensed person: Any person licensed by the board who violates any provision of this Act is liable for an administrative fine not to exceed two thousand dollars for each offense; (b) Licensed business entity: Any business entity permitted to practice by the board that violates any provision of this Act is liable for an administrative fine not to exceed five thousand dollars for each offense. An administrative fine not paid within sixty days from the date of the order imposing the fine may be enforced by an action in the appropriate county circuit court. Any person aggrieved by an order under this subdivision may make an appeal pursuant to chapter 1-26; (2) Injunction: If the board deems it necessary for the public safety, it may bring an action in the name of the state in the circuit court in any county in which jurisdiction is proper to enjoin the act, practice, or violation and to enforce compliance with this Act or any rule promulgated pursuant to this Act. Upon showing that a person has engaged in an otherwise unauthorized act or practice, a permanent or temporary injunction, or restraining order, or other appropriate relief shall be obtained against the person to prohibit the continuation of the unauthorized act or practice. If a person has caused a structure to be designed, constructed, or built by engaging in an unauthorized act or practice, a permanent or temporary injunction or restraining order, or other appropriate relief, shall be obtained against the project prohibiting the use and occupancy of any structure. For purposes of injunctive relief under this subdivision, irreparable harm exists if the board shows that a person has engaged in an act or practice constituting the unauthorized use of a title, words, figures, or sign implying licensure, or a violation of a statute, rule, or order that the board has issued or is empowered to enforce; (3) Cease and desist order: The board may issue and have served upon a person an order requiring the person to cease and desist from any unauthorized practice or act which is in violation of this Act or any rule promulgated pursuant to this Act. The cease and desist order shall give reasonable notice of the rights of the person to request a hearing pursuant to chapter 1-26 and shall state the reasons for the entry of the order. Section 62. Service of the order is effective if the order is served on the person or counsel of record personally or by certified mail to the most recent address provided to the board for the person or counsel of record. Unless otherwise agreed by the board and the person requesting the hearing, the hearing shall be held no later than ninety days after the request for the hearing is received by the board. Section 63. The board or administrative law judge shall issue a report within thirty days of the close of the contested case hearing record. Within thirty days after the report and any exceptions to it, the board shall issue a further order vacating, modifying, or making permanent the cease and desist orders as the facts require. Section 64. If no hearing is requested within the thirty days of service of the order, the order becomes final and remains in effect until it is modified or vacated by the board. If the person to whom a cease and desist order is issued fails to appear at the hearing after being duly notified, the person is in default and the proceeding may be determined against that person upon consideration of the cease and desist order, the allegations of which may be considered to be true. Action taken pursuant to this section does not relieve a person from criminal prosecution by a competent authority or from disciplinary action by the board with respect to the person's license, registration, certification, application for examination, or renewal. Section 65. No person may: (1) Practice, or offer to practice, the professions of engineering, architecture, land surveying, landscape architecture, petroleum release assessment, or petroleum release remediation in this state without being licensed or exempt in accordance with the provisions of this Act; (2) Use or employ the title of architect, landscape architect, land surveyor, professional engineer, petroleum release assessor, or petroleum release remediator with or without qualifying adjectives without being licensed in accordance with the provisions of this Act; (3) Use any other words, letters, or figures indicating or intending to imply that the person is a professional engineer, architect, land surveyor, landscape architect, petroleum release assessor, or petroleum release remediator without being licensed in accordance with the provision of this Act; (4) Present or attempt to use the certificate of licensure or seal of another, or affix a professional engineer's, architect's, land surveyor's, or landscape architect's seal on any plans, specifications, drawings, or other technical submittals which have not been prepared by that person or under that person's responsible charge and direct personal supervision; (5) Present any false or forged evidence of any kind to the board in obtaining a certificate of licensure; (6) Falsely impersonate any other licensee; (7) Attempt to use an expired, suspended, or revoked license; (8) Knowingly allow person's name or seal to be used upon plans or work not actually performed by that person or under that person's responsible charge and direct supervision; or (9) By act of commission or omission, violates any of the provisions of this Act. A violation of this section is a Class 2 misdemeanor. Section 66. No person may: (1) Accept or contract to receive, directly or indirectly, any commission, percentage, gift, or other item of value for that person's influence in securing a contract or approving the performance of a contract, from any manufacturer, agent, or vendor of any material of any sort used or recommended to be used in the construction of any project for the plans or construction of which any person is employed; or (2) Give or offer to give to any person any commission, percentage, gift, or other item of value for that person's influence in securing a contract or approving the performance of a contract or supplying any material of any sort which may be for consideration in the construction of any project. A violation of this section is a Class 2 misdemeanor for the first offense and a Class 1 misdemeanor for the second or any subsequent offense. Section 67. The board may impose a fee to reimburse the board for all or part of the cost of proceedings resulting in disciplinary action authorized by this Act, the imposition of civil penalties, or the issuance of a cease and desist order. The fee may be imposed if the board shows a person has committed an act or engaged in unauthorized practice, including the unauthorized use of a title, words, figures, or signs implying licensure, or has violated a statute, rule or order of the board. The costs include the amount paid by the board for services from attorney fees, investigators, court reporters, witnesses, expert witnesses, reproduction of records, board members' per diem compensation, board staff time, and expense incurred by board members and staff. Section 68. A professional engineer, architect, land surveyor, landscape architect, petroleum release assessor, or petroleum release remediator is not liable for the safety of persons or property on or about a construction project site, or for the construction techniques, procedures, sequences, and schedules, or for the conduct, action, errors, or omissions of any construction contractor, subcontractor, construction manager, or material supplier, their agents or employees, unless that person assumes responsibility therefor by contract or by that person's actual conduct. This section does not relieve a professional engineer, architect, land surveyor, landscape architect, petroleum release assessor, or petroleum release remediator from liability for that person's negligence in design work. Section 69. Any contract, written or oral, for engineering, architectural, land surveying, landscape architectural, petroleum release assessment, or petroleum release remediation services made by any person in violation of any provision of this Act is unenforceable as to such services. It is a complete defense to any action to enforce payment for any services, if the party contracting for services proves that the person rendering or offering to render services was not at the time such services were offered or rendered, legally authorized to contract for such services. Section 70. No public officer or employee, as defined in subdivisions 22-1-2(37) and (39), charged with the authority or responsibility of approving or accepting plans, specifications, plats, or any other technical submissions, may accept or approve such plans, specifications, plats, or technical submissions which have been prepared in violation of this Act. The building official shall require the owner to engage and designate an architect or professional engineer who shall act as the architect or professional engineer of record on projects that are not exempt. If the circumstances require, the owner may designate a substitute architect or professional engineer of record who shall perform all of the duties required of the original architect or professional engineer of record. The building official shall be notified in writing by the owner if the architect or professional engineer of record is changed or is unable to continue to perform the duties. The architect or professional engineer of record is responsible for reviewing and coordinating all submittal documents prepared by others, including deferred submittal items, for compatibility with the design of the building. A building permit issued with respect to technical submissions which do not conform with the requirements of this Act are invalid. Section 71. No register of deeds of any county may file or record any map, plat, survey, or other technical submissions within the definition of land surveying which does not have impressed thereon and affixed thereto the personal signature, seal, and date of a land surveyor by whom or under whose responsible charge and direct personal supervision the map, plat, survey, or other technical submissions were prepared. Section 72. The board may promulgate rules, pursuant to chapter 1-26, regarding procedures and standards for certifying those who perform environmental technical services relative to site assessment, remedial investigations, and corrective actions necessary to remediate water or soil contaminated with a regulated substance and to establish fees to support this activity. Procedures and requirements may be promulgated by rule for determining eligibility, denial, suspension, and revocation of certification. Standards may include more than one level of certification for persons and business entities, any combination of academic background, professional experience, testing, or other technical professional licenses. Any person or business entity who practices without certification pursuant to this section is guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor. Section 73. No person or business entity may perform environmental technical services without certification. A violation of this section is a Class 1 misdemeanor. Section 74. That \u00a7 \u00a7 36-18-4.1 to 36-18-73, inclusive, be repealed. Section 75. All licenses and enrollments in effect on July 1, 1999, and issued pursuant to chapter 36-18, are continued for the balance of the term for which last issued.
