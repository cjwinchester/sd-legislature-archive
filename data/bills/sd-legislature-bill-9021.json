A free-press, eternal vigilance, diligent reporting, and an informed public are instrumental to maintaining the freedoms of the American people; and WHEREAS, much work remains to be done as reporting on the affairs of government is a never-ending, difficult task; and WHEREAS, while we commend Angela for her past exceptional reporting to the public, our commendation is not in-conclusion, but a well-deserved interim gesture of appreciation, respect, and encouragement for her continued efforts: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT COMMEMORATED, by the Ninety-Third Legislature of the State of South Dakota, on behalf of the great people of South Dakota, we hereby commend and honor Angela Kennecke for her excellence in investigative reporting.
