The rules shall specify application and drawing procedures and conditions for issuance of a license to an applicant, which shall be substantially similar to the procedures and conditions established by the commission by rule for nonresident special deer licenses for use in areas west of the Missouri River.

These licenses are valid only on private property not leased by the Department of Game, Fish and Parks for public hunting in any West River prairie deer unit. The license is valid for one \"any deer.\" Applicants may apply for and receive both an East River special any deer license and a West River special any deer license. A successful West River special any deer licensee may not apply for a West River deer license in the initial or second drawing. A successful West River deer licensee may not apply for a leftover West River special any deer license. No person may make application for or receive the special any deer license provided for in this section unless the following conditions are met: (1) The applicant has permission from an owner or lessee of private land to hunt deer on the owner's or lessee's property located within the permitted area during the deer hunting season for which the special any deer license is issued; and (2) The applicant includes on the application for a special any deer license the name and telephone number of the owner or lessee of the private property granting the permission."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 2283, "action_date": "2011-01-24T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 15455, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/15455.pdf", "status_text": "First read in Senate and referred to", "journal_page": 175, "committee_id_action": 113, "committee_id_assigned": 89, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 2283, "action_date": "2011-02-01T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 15762, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/15762.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 89, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 2283, "action_date": "2011-02-01T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 16109, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/16109.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to the 41st legislative day", "journal_page": 276, "committee_id_action": 89, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 8401, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [75, 41, 25, 13, 22], "Nay": [46, 24, 31, 34]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/2283"}
