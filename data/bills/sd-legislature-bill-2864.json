Upon compliance with \u00a7 34-45-2, the governing body may assess a monthly uniform charge in an amount not to exceed seventy-five one dollar and fifty cents per service user line. Any prepaid wireless telecommunications service provider shall remit the 911 emergency surcharge for each active prepaid wireless telecommunication service user account to the South Dakota 911 coordination fund. The proceeds are continuously appropriated for reimbursement of nonrecurring and recurring costs of 911 service and operating expenses of the board. No such charge may be imposed upon more than one hundred service user lines or equivalent service, per customer account billed, per month. In the case of multi-station network systems, service user lines shall be equal to the number of calls that can simultaneously be made from such system to the public switched telephone network. 135 copies were printed on recycled paper by the South Dakota Legislative Research Council at a cost of $.075 per page. .
