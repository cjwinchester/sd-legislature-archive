No individual is required to be licensed pursuant to this chapter as a surplus lines broker if the selling, soliciting, or negotiating of surplus lines insurance takes place in an insured's home state and the home state of the insured is a state other than South Dakota. Section 2. That \u00a7 58-32-16 be amended to read as follows: 58-32-16. If certain insurance coverages cannot be procured from authorized insurers, such the coverages, hereinafter designated \", surplus lines,\" may be procured from unauthorized insurers, subject to the conditions set forth in \u00a7\u00a7 58-32-17 to 58-32-19, inclusive. The provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 58-32-16 to 58-32-18, inclusive, do not apply to exempt commercial lines policyholders as defined in \u00a7\u00a7 58-24-68 and 58-24-69 if: (1) The broker procuring or placing the surplus lines insurance has disclosed to the exempt commercial purchaser that the insurance may or may not be available from the admitted market that may provide greater protection with more regulatory oversight; and (2) The exempt commercial purchaser has subsequently requested in writing the broker to procure or place the insurance from a nonadmitted insurer. Section 3. That \u00a7 58-32-22 be amended to read as follows: 58-32-22. The insurer with which surplus line insurance is placed: (1) Shall be authorized to transact insurance of the kind involved in at least one state of the United States, and have either unimpaired capital or surplus, or both, that is equal or greater than the minimum capital and surplus requirements under \u00a7 58-6-23.

The finding shall be based upon such factors as quality of management, capital and surplus of any parent company, company underwriting profit and investment income trends, market availability, and company record and reputation within the industry. The director may not make an affirmative finding of acceptability if the nonadmitted insurer's capital and surplus is less than four million five hundred thousand dollars. Section 4. That \u00a7 58-32-44 be amended to read as follows: 58-32-44.

Such The tax shall be is in lieu of all other taxes upon such insurers with respect to the business so reported. When collected, the tax shall be credited to the general fund.

For a surplus lines policy issued to an insured whose home state is this state and where only a portion of the risk is located in this state, the entire premium tax shall be paid to the director in accordance with \u00a7 58-32-44. If the director finds it would increase the efficiency of the surplus lines insurance marketplace as well as the regulation of the surplus lines market, the director may enter into a multi-state surplus lines agreement for the eligibility for placement of surplus lines insurance and the payment, reporting, collection, and apportionment of surplus lines premium taxes. If a surplus line policy covers risks or exposures only partially in this state and the director has entered into agreement with other states for the apportionment of premium taxes for multi-state risks, the tax payable under \u00a7 58-32-44 shall be computed and paid upon the proportion of the premium which is properly allocable to the risks or exposures located in this state according to the terms of any such agreement. The multi-state agreement may also include the eligibility for placement of surplus lines insurance and the payment, reporting, collection, and apportionment of surplus lines premium taxes for risks that are not multi-state and for independently procured surplus lines pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 58-32-47 to 58-32-55, inclusive.

If more than one insured from an affiliated group are named insureds on a single nonadmitted insurance contract, the term means the home state as determined under subdivision (1) of this section of the member of the affiliated group that has the largest percentage of premium attributable to it under the contract."}, {"bill_id": 2374, "bill_version_id": 16681, "bill_version": "Enrolled",
