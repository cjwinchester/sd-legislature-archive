WHEREAS, a tax is a compulsory financial contribution levied by a government for the general support of the government and the services it provides; and WHEREAS, a fee is a charge levied by a government on specific persons, activities, or properties as payment for a direct benefit received; and WHEREAS, there is often confusion about the distinction between these two government funding mechanisms, and certain individuals and groups, particularly at times of an election, deliberately confuse voters about that distinction: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the House of Representatives of the Ninetieth Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the Senate concurring therein, that there is a clear and distinct difference between the taxes levied by the State of South Dakota and the fees levied by the State of South Dakota and the agencies thereof, and that an increase in fees is not an increase in taxes. 170 copies were printed on recycled paper by the South Dakota Legislative Research Council at a cost of $.098 per page. .
