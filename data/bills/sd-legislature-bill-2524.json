BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. Terms used in this Act mean: (1) \"Condemn,\" to take property under the power of eminent domain; (2) \"Condemnee,\" a person who has or claims an interest in property that is the subject of a prospective or pending condemnation action; (3) \"Condemnor,\" a private for profit corporation or utility empowered to condemn. Section 2. The attorney general, with the cooperation of appropriate state agencies, shall prepare pamphlets in readable format describing the eminent domain laws of this state. The pamphlets shall include the reasons for condemnation, the procedures followed by condemnors, how citizens may influence the condemnation process, and the rights of property owners and citizens affected by condemnation. The attorney general shall make copies of the pamphlets available to all condemnors who shall be charged a price for the pamphlets sufficient to recover the costs of production. A condemnor shall present a copy of the pamphlet to a property owner prior to making an offer to purchase and initiating a condemnation action. Section 3. A condemnor shall make reasonable and diligent efforts to acquire property by good faith negotiation. Section 4. In attempting to acquire the property by purchase under this Act, the condemnor shall negotiate in good faith and may contract with respect to: (1) Any element of valuation or damages recognized by law as relevant to the amount of just compensation payable for the property; (2) The extent, term, or nature of the property interest or other right to be acquired; (3) The quantity, location, or boundary of the property; (4) The acquisition, removal, relocation, or disposition of improvements upon the property and of personal property not sought to be taken; (5) The date of proposed entry and physical dispossession; (6) The time and method of payment of agreed compensation or other amounts authorized by law; and (7) Any other terms or conditions deemed appropriate by either of the parties. Section 5. Good faith negotiation shall include: (1) Prior to making an initial offer, a preliminary written notice to the landowner shall include: (a) The proposed project, the land proposed to be condemned, plan of work, operations and facilities in a manner sufficient to enable the condemnor to evaluate the effect of the proposed project, plan of work, operations and facilities on the condemned's use of the land, to the extent reasonably known at the time; (b) A description of the general location and extent of the property sought, with sufficient detail for reasonable identification; (c) A statement that, at the condemnee's request, a representative of the condemnor will tour the property sought with the condemnee or the condemnee's representative at a mutually agreeable time prior to the condemnor's initial written offer to discuss issues related to properties sought; (d) An estimate of the fair market value of the property sought and the general basis for such estimate; and (e) A discussion of the reclamation planned by the condemnor for the property disturbed by the condemnor's project; and (2) A bona fide initial offer to acquire the property sought sent by certified mail. This offer shall be accompanied by written notice that the condemnee is under no obligation to accept this initial written offer, but if the condemnee fails to respond to the initial written offer, the right to object to the good faith of the condemnor may be waived, and that the condemnee has a right to seek advice from an attorney, real estate appraiser, or any other person of the condemnee's choice during the negotiations and any subsequent legal proceedings. Section 6. The condemnee may make a counteroffer in writing within sixty-five days of the initial offer specified in section 5 of this Act specifying areas of disagreement. Section 7. The condemnor shall make a final offer including a response to any areas of disagreement indicated by the condemnee. The final offer shall be sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, at least thirty days prior to commencing a condemnation action. Section 8. A condemnee may request one appraisal to be done by an appraiser chosen by the condemnee. The condemnor shall pay for such appraisal. Section 9. No action to condemn property may be maintained over timely objection by the condemnee unless the condemnor made a good faith effort to acquire the property by purchase before commencing the action. No condemnee may object to the good faith of the condemnor if the condemnee has failed to respond to an initial written offer as provided in section 5 of this Act and the condemnor has met the requirements of section 5 of this Act. Section 10. The condemnor shall, prior to filing any petition pursuant to \u00a7 21-35-1, file with the governmental entity having jurisdiction over the proposed project, a petition that names the person, group, or corporation desiring to take or damage private property as plaintiff, and all persons having interest in or liens upon the property affected by the proceeding as defendants, so far as they shall be known at the time of the filing. The petition shall contain a description of the property to be taken or damaged and a statement that the plaintiff has negotiated in good faith to acquire all property needed without the use of eminent domain and that all state and federal permits have been granted. A copy of each permit shall be attached to the petition. If the right is granted to the condemnor, the condemnor shall exercise that right by filing condemnation proceedings in circuit court within ninety days or the right is revoked. The purpose for which the property is to be taken or damaged shall be clearly set forth in the petition. It is not necessary to specify the interests or claims of the several defendants in the land or property affected by the proceeding. Section 11. That \u00a7 21-35-10.1 be amended to read as follows: 21-35-10.1. Within thirty days from the date the summons described in \u00a7 21-35-9 is served, the defendant may demand a hearing in circuit court on the petitioner's right to take. At this hearing, the condemnor shall prove the following: (1) The condemnor used good faith negotiations; (2) The condemnor successfully negotiated purchase or easement agreements with at least seventy percent of the affected landowners, if more than ten landowners are involved; (3) That the project is planned for the greatest public good with the least private injury; (4) That the project is a public use consistent with public necessity; and (5) That the condemnee's property is necessary for the project. Failure to make such demand or to consent in writing to the taking, within the thirty-day period, shall constitute a waiver of the right to question the necessity of the taking. The finding of necessity by the plaintiff, unless based upon fraud, bad faith, or an abuse of discretion, shall be binding on all persons. Section 12. That chapter 21-35 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: For the purposes of this chapter, the fair market value as determined by a jury may include: (1) The price paid for easements of comparable type, size, and location on the same or similar property; and (2) The value determined by using generally accepted appraisal techniques and may include: (a) The value determined by appraisal of the property by a certified appraiser; (b) The price paid for other comparable easements or leases of comparable type, size, and location on the same or similar property; and (c) Values paid for transactions of comparable type, size, and location by other companies in arms-length transactions for comparable transactions on the same or similar property. Section 13. Upon abandonment, nonuse for a period of five years, or transfer or attempted transfer to a use where the transferee could not have condemned for the new use, or where the new use is not identical to the original use and new damages to the landowner whose property was condemned for the original use will occur, any easement or ownership authorized under this Act terminates. The property shall be restored as much as possible by the condemnor to the condition before condemnation or the condemnor shall pay the condemnee for any cost to restore the property to the property's condition before condemnation. Section 14. That \u00a7 49-16A-75 be repealed. 49-16A-75. A railroad may exercise the right of eminent domain in acquiring right-of-way as provided by statute, but only upon obtaining authority from the Governor or if directed by the Governor, or the commission, based upon a determination by the Governor or the commission that the railroad's exercise of the right of eminent domain would be for a public use consistent with public necessity. The Governor or the commission shall consider the requirements of \u00a7\u00a7 49-16A-75.1 to 49-16A-75.3, inclusive, when granting or denying an application for authority to use eminent domain. The decision to grant or deny an application shall be made after reasonable notice and opportunity to be heard, pursuant to chapter 1-26. However, an impartial hearing examiner may be appointed by the Governor or the commission to administer the proceedings or make recommendations. Any parties who are united in interest or representation shall unite in the filing of an affidavit for change of hearing examiner under the provisions of \u00a7 1-26D-10. The filing of such affidavit by one party is deemed to be filed by all of the parties. No more than one change of hearing examiner may be granted on request or affidavit made by or on behalf of the same party or parties united in interest under the provisions of \u00a7 1-26D-10. However, the filing of an affidavit and the first change of hearing examiner does not prevent any other party to the action or any party's attorney from obtaining a change in hearing examiner upon a showing of an unacceptable risk of actual bias or prejudice concerning a party. The Governor or the chair of the commission shall replace the hearing examiner within five business days upon any recusal. A hearing shall be held and a decision rendered on any application within ninety days following the receipt of a new application and upon any application pending before the Governor or the commission on July 1, 2008. The denial or withdrawal of an application does not prejudice the ability of a railroad to resubmit an application. Any appeal, pursuant to chapter 1-26, taken from a decision of the Governor or the commission shall be handled as an expedited appeal by the courts of this state. Section 15. That \u00a7 49-16A-75.1 be repealed. 49-16A-75.1. The commission shall in accordance with chapter 1-26, promulgate rules: (1) Establishing a form upon which a railroad may apply for authority to exercise the right of eminent domain; (2) Specifying the information to be submitted by an applicant; and (3) Administering applications for authority to exercise the right of eminent domain. Section 16. That \u00a7 49-16A-75.2 be repealed. 49-16A-75.2. The applicant has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the exercise of the right of eminent domain is a public use consistent with public necessity. Section 17. That \u00a7 49-16A-75.3 be repealed. 49-16A-75.3. A railroad's exercise of the right of eminent domain is a public use consistent with public necessity only if the use of eminent domain is proposed by an applicant who has negotiated in good faith to privately acquire sufficient property without the use of eminent domain. No determination of public use or necessity or any other issue properly decided by the Governor or the commission may be addressed by the circuit court in an action for condemnation. Such a determination may only be challenged upon direct appeal of that determination. Notwithstanding appeal of such determination, the railroad may proceed at any time by action in circuit court for possession and determination of compensation for any real property taken or damaged. Section 18. That \u00a7 49-16A-75.4 be repealed. 49-16A-75.4. Upon a failure to reach agreement on compensation following a determination pursuant to \u00a7 49-16A-75.3, either party may bring a proceeding in state court to establish compensation to be paid for the property taken or damaged. The court shall expedite the proceedings. A railroad is not entitled to physical possession of the property to be taken pursuant to the exercise of eminent domain except upon the earlier to occur of either: (1) Execution of a written agreement between the parties as to fair market value of compensation; (2) Entry of a judgment of condemnation in the circuit court; or (3) Upon posting by the railroad of a bond to be established by the court as soon as possible but no later than one hundred twenty days following petition by the railroad for possession. The bond shall be in an amount the court determines to be a preliminary estimate of compensation based on the best information available, but is not determinative of final compensation or admissible as evidence thereon."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 2524, "action_date": "2011-01-26T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 15737, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/15737.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 185, "committee_id_action": 115, "committee_id_assigned": 108, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 2524, "action_date": "2011-02-07T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 16218, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/16218.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 108, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 2524, "action_date": "2011-02-07T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 16383, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/16383.pdf", "status_text": "Tabled", "journal_page": 294, "committee_id_action": 108, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 8628, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [12, 53, 60, 51, 59, 36, 61, 57, 37, 58, 5, 35, 91]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/2524"}
