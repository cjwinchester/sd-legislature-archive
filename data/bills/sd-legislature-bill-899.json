If the financing statement covers goods of a debtor rural electric cooperative which are or are to become fixtures, no description of the real estate or the name of the record owner thereof is required. Filing of a financing statement against the property of a debtor rural electric cooperative is effective until released or terminated. Section 2. That chapter 47-21 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: A mortgage or trust deed to secure a debt executed by a rural electric cooperative, covering the whole or part of its easements or other less than fee simple interests in real estate used in the transmission or distribution of electric service, and also covering the fixtures of the rural electric cooperative which are annexed to it, may be filed in the Office of the Secretary of State along with, or as part of, the financing statement covering the fixtures. The filing of the mortgage or deed of trust has the same effect, and is notice of the rights and interest of the mortgagee or trustee in the easements and other less than fee simple interest in real estate to the same extent as if the mortgage or deed of trust were duly recorded in the office of the register of deeds of each county in which the real estate is situated. The effectiveness of the filing terminates at the same time as provided in section 1 of this Act for the termination of the effectiveness of a fixture filing. For the purpose of this section, a mortgage or deed of trust filed under this section contains a sufficient description to give notice of the rights and interest of the mortgagee or trustee in the easements and other less than fee simple interest in the real estate used for the transmission and distribution of electric service of the rural electric cooperative if the mortgage or deed of trust states that the security includes rights-of-way of, or transmission or distribution systems of, or lines of, the rural electric cooperative, or all property owned by the rural electric cooperative. A mortgage or deed of trust filed before July 1, 2009, pursuant to \u00a7 47-21-46, which complies with the provisions of this section, is filed under this section as of July 1, 2009.

Any rural electric cooperative may make a single filing under sections 1 and 2 of this Act, and the secretary of state shall accept the same as a single filing for both purposes. The financing statement shall identify the rural electric cooperative as a transmitting utility and shall be indexed under \u00a7 57A-9-501(b), but the index may also refer to the secretary of state's recording data for real estate records under sections 1 and 2 of this Act and the retention by the secretary of state of a microfilm or other photographic copy of the document filed in the real estate records shall be sufficient to comply with the retention requirements of \u00a7 57A-9-522. Section 4. That chapter 47-21 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Any trust deed or mortgage described in \u00a7 47-21-46 and sections 1 and 2 of this Act may be assigned or discharged by filing for record in the Office of the Secretary of State and in the Office of the Register of Deeds of each county, if any, in which the trust deed or mortgage has been filed for record an instrument of assignment or discharge executed in the manner and providing the information required with respect to real estate mortgages by \u00a7 \u00a7 44-8-13 and 44-8-14, respectively. However, no such instrument need provide the description of the mortgaged property, except that an instrument of discharge whereby less than all the mortgaged property is released from the lien of the trust deed or mortgage provides the full description of, or clearly identify by reference to numbered or lettered portions of the descriptions as the same appears in the trust deed or mortgage, the property so released."}, {"bill_id": 899, "bill_version_id": 7562, "bill_version": "Senate Commerce and Energy Engrossed", "bill_version_date": "2009-02-17T14:08:36.857-06:00", "bill_text": "FOR AN ACT ENTITLED, An Act to provide for central filing of documents necessary to perfect a security interest in personal property or fixtures of a rural electric cooperative.
