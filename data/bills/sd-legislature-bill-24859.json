An individual who holds an active one-year CTE instructor educator permit is considered certified pursuant to this chapter. The applicant must submit documentation from a public or department-accredited school showing that the school is unable to hire a certified educator to fill the vacancy and listing the position to be held by the applicant and the name of the certified teacher who will act as a mentor to the applicant. The applicant must submit the required documentation on forms approved by the secretary. The South Dakota Board of Education Standards shall promulgate rules, pursuant to chapter 1-26, establishing the process by which an applicant may apply for the one-year CTE instructor educator permit, the CTE career pathway endorsements that the applicant for the one-year CTE instructor educator permit is eligible to add to the permit, and what continuing education an individual must complete to renew the one-year CTE instructor educator permit.
