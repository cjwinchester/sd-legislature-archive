BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 31-13-1 be amended to read as follows: 31-13-1. The board of township supervisors shall construct, repair, and maintain all of the secondary township roads, as defined pursuant to \u00a7 31-1-5, within the township. The board shall, at its annual meeting, designate which secondary township roads are full maintenance roads and which are minimum maintenance roads. The board of township supervisors shall publish any resolution designating a secondary township road as minimum maintenance if such the road is a school route. The designation shall be final, after a lapse of thirty days, unless appealed as provided in chapter 31-3. Following its annual meeting, the board shall submit to the county auditor an official map showing each road on the township road system, including any road designated as a minimum maintenance road. Section 2. That \u00a7 31-13-1.1 be amended to read as follows: 31-13-1.1. The board of township supervisors may designate a secondary township road within the township as a minimum maintenance road if the board determines that the road or a segment of the road is used only occasionally or intermittently for passenger and commercial travel. The board shall identify the beginning and end points of the road designated as minimum maintenance. A minimum maintenance road may be maintained at a level less than the minimum standards for full maintenance roads, but shall be maintained at the level required to serve the occasional or intermittent traffic. Section 3. That \u00a7 31-13-13 be amended to read as follows: 31-13-13. The board of supervisors of any township may jointly contract with the county of which such the township is a part, and also with any municipality within or adjoining such the township, for the laying out, construction, graveling, hard surfacing, or maintenance of designated township roads. The agreement shall designate the governing board to be charged with contracting for performance of the work, provide for supervision of the work and allocate the costs between the units of government participating. The board of township supervisors may also contract with any other political subdivision, homeowner's association, or rural subdivision developer to perform maintenance work on any road that is not on the township road system."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 2628, "action_date": "2011-01-24T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 15453, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/15453.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 144, "committee_id_action": 115, "committee_id_assigned": 106, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 2628, "action_date": "2011-02-01T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 15842, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/15842.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 106, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 2628, "action_date": "2011-02-08T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 16253, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/16253.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 106, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 2628, "action_date": "2011-02-08T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 16515, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/16515.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to the 41st legislative day", "journal_page": 314, "committee_id_action": 106, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 8706, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [87, 49, 20, 83, 85, 32, 5, 64, 93, 74, 101, 60, 39]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/2628"}
