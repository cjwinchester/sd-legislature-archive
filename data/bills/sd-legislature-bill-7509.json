BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That the code be amended by adding a NEW SECTION to read: The Department of Social Services shall develop and implement a drug testing program to randomly test two percent of the adult applicants for the temporary assistance for needy families cash benefits upon application for benefits. A recipient who is found to have tested positive for the use of a controlled substance that was not prescribed for the applicant by a health care provider shall be tested again within forty-five days. If the applicant tests positive a second time for the use of a controlled substance that was not prescribed for the applicant by a health care provider, the department shall provide the applicant with information on available drug treatment programs, and the applicant shall be tested again within forty-five days. If the applicant tests positive a third time for the use of a controlled substance that was not prescribed for the applicant by a health care provider, the applicant becomes ineligible to receive benefits for a period of one year. The applicant shall pay the cost of each test where the applicant tests positive for the use of a controlled substance that was not prescribed for the applicant by a health care provider through a reduction in benefits. Any aggrieved applicant is entitled to an administrative hearing to determine the validity of the tests and to contest the decision to suspend the benefits."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 7509, "action_date": "2016-02-04T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 38838, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/38838.pdf", "status_text": "First read in Senate and referred to", "journal_page": 214, "committee_id_action": 309, "committee_id_assigned": 298, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 7509, "action_date": "2016-02-10T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 38986, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/38986.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 298, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 7509, "action_date": "2016-02-17T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 39171, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/39171.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 298, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 7509, "action_date": "2016-02-18T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 39583, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/39583.pdf", "status_text": "Referred to", "journal_page": 337, "committee_id_action": 309, "committee_id_assigned": 299, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 7509, "action_date": "2016-02-22T08:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 39589, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/39589.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 299, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 7509, "action_date": "2016-02-22T08:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 39732, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/39732.pdf", "status_text": "Do Not Pass", "journal_page": 378, "committee_id_action": 299, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 21249, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [999, 1020, 1047, 970, 971], "Excused": [1008, 1013], "Nay": [998, 1011]}}, {"bill_id": 7509, "action_date": "2016-02-23T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 39863, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/39863.pdf", "status_text": "No motion to place on calendar", "journal_page": 411, "committee_id_action": 309, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}]}
