BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. The Legislature finds that the parents of children who are in the care of the state continue to require the maintenance of the familial relationship which should not be restricted to any greater extent than the physical separation consequent to state custody makes inevitable. To implement this principle, the Legislature recognizes the following rights of parents with children in the care of the state: (1) The right to information regarding their children: (a) Written reports of any incidents involving their children either as actors or as witnesses; (b) Prompt notification of any significant injury or episode such as fainting, seizure, asthma attack, or suicide attempt; (c) Timely notification and explanation, by a qualified medical professional, of any medical services rendered or medication changes ordered; (d) Monthly reports including academic grades and homework, progress through rehabilitation programs notes, and psychological counseling progress notes; (e) Prior notice of any transfers to another facility except emergency transfers; (f) Notice of and participation in program induction and exit processes and ceremonies; (2) The right to maintain the familial relationship with their children: (a) Clear, uniform, written and published, rules of contact which facilitate maintaining the parent child bond; (b) Weekly visitation which should not be revoked as a means of discipline; (c) Next day visitation after any significant injury or episode such as fainting, seizure, asthma attack, or suicide attempt; (d) Twice weekly telephone calls; (e) Unlimited private mail correspondence, absent a showing of physical, mental, or emotional harm to the child or facilitation or attempted facilitation of escape; (f) Unfettered physical contact with their children during all visitations absent a showing that there is a reasonable threat of physical harm from the child toward either the parents or facility staff, or from the parent toward the child; (g) Family counseling both immediately prior to and immediately post release of their children from incarceration; (3) The right to oversee the religious, spiritual, and moral training of their children: (a) Permitting the parents to provide their children with such religious, spiritual, or moral treatises or supplies as they deem necessary to the practice of each child's individual religion; (b) Permitting parents to arrange for religious, spiritual, or moral leaders or teachers of their choosing to visit their children on a regular basis."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 15688, "action_date": "2000-01-24T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 85638, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/85638.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 202, "committee_id_action": 656, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 15688, "action_date": "2000-01-25T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 85640, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/85640.pdf", "status_text": "Referred to", "journal_page": 225, "committee_id_action": 656, "committee_id_assigned": 651, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 15688, "action_date": "2000-01-31T19:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 85823, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/85823.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 651, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 15688, "action_date": "2000-01-31T19:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 85823, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/85823.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass Amended,", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 651, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "F", "vote": {"vote_id": 45689, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [2313, 2333, 2351, 2353, 2363, 2388, 2393, 2372, 2319], "Yea": [2337, 2345, 2360, 2368]}}, {"bill_id": 15688, "action_date": "2000-01-31T19:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 85823, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/85823.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to 36th legislative day", "journal_page": 324, "committee_id_action": 651, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 45690, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [2313, 2333, 2351, 2353, 2363, 2388, 2393, 2372, 2319], "Nay": [2337, 2345, 2360, 2368]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/15688"}
