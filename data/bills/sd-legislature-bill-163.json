It is a Class 2 misdemeanor for any person occupying a motor vehicle located upon a public highway or the right-of-way of a public highway to consume any alcoholic beverage or have a package or any receptacle containing an alcoholic beverage in that person's possession unless the seal of the original package remains unbroken or the alcoholic beverage is so removed from the passenger area of the motor vehicle that no occupant of the motor vehicle has access to it. However, no person may be charged pursuant to this section unless the law enforcement officer has probable cause to believe that alcohol has been consumed by some occupant of the vehicle and a chemical analysis of the occupant's breath or blood discloses there is alcohol in the person's body. 170 copies were printed on recycled paper by the South Dakota Legislative Research Council at a cost of $.093 per page. .
