The credit shall be paid to the jurisdictions in which the person has accrued a fuel tax liability under the provisions of an interstate compact or reciprocal agreement. If no liability exists, the credit shall be refunded to the person. Section 3. That \u00a7 10-47B-172 be AMENDED: 10-47B-172. The purpose of this section and \u00a7\u00a7 10-47B-173 to 10-47B-180, inclusive, is to provide an additional method of collecting the tax on motor fuel, ethyl alcohol, methyl alcohol, biodiesel, biodiesel blend, liquid natural gas, liquid petroleum gas, compressed natural gas, special fuel, or any combination thereof, taxes from interstate operators of qualified motor vehicles commensurate with their operations on South Dakota highways. No person may bring into this state, in the fuel supply tanks of a licensed qualified motor vehicle, or in any other container regardless of whether it is connected to the motor of the qualified vehicle, any motor fuel, ethyl alcohol, methyl alcohol, biodiesel, biodiesel blend, liquid natural gas, liquid petroleum gas, compressed natural gas, special fuel, or any combination thereof, to be used in the operation of the qualified vehicle in this state, unless advance arrangements have been made for payment of this state's fuel tax on all fuel consumed. These advance arrangements may include the obtaining of either a permanent interstate fuel user license or a temporary single\u2011trip fuel permit issued by the department or its authorized agent, or authorization to operate under the provisions of an interstate compact or reciprocal agreement.

The tax liability of an interstate fuel user licensee shall be determined based on average fuel consumption for all qualified vehicles operated by the licensee within this state. Average fuel consumption is equal to the total fleet vehicle miles traveled divided by total fleet gallons of fuel consumed to calculate an average mile per gallon (AMPG) for all vehicles operated. This AMPG is then divided into the total miles traveled within South Dakota by all vehicles to determine the total gallons of fuel attributable to South Dakota operations. The gallons thus calculated shall be multiplied times the motor fuel, ethyl alcohol, methyl alcohol, biodiesel, biodiesel blend, liquid natural gas, liquid petroleum gas, compressed natural gas, special fuel, or any combination thereof, per gallon tax rate currently in force at the time the return is completed to determine the total tax due from the licensee.
