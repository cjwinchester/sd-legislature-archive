WHEREAS, the use of prescription drugs improves the quality of care and helps patients live healthier, longer, and more productive lives while keeping them out of more costly acute care settings in the long term; and WHEREAS, the increased use of new and improved prescription drugs has changed the delivery of health care in the United States since Medicare was enacted; and WHEREAS, Congress did not enact a drug benefit in the Medicare program, therefore the program is inadequate in providing the elderly and disabled the most appropriate drug therapies, preventing the delivery of quality health care at an affordable cost; and WHEREAS, the private sector provides affordable coverage by negotiating discounts on drugs and meeting the needs of special populations with chronic diseases by coordinating care with disease management, drug utilization review, and patient education programs; and WHEREAS, comprehensive reform of the Medicare program would utilize the successful tools of the private sector in coordinating care for this population and consider the use of the marketplace to foster competition among private plans, resulting in more choices of quality coverage for seniors and the disabled while maintaining the financial sustainability of the program; and WHEREAS, Congress has failed to provide for comprehensive reform of Medicare, instead encouraging states to use their own resources to ease the burden of their elderly and disabled populations and effectively assume an unfunded, informal mandate; and WHEREAS, in implementing state programs to assist the Medicare population, state budgetary constraints can often result in requirements to restrict and limit the patients' access to needed prescription drugs: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the House of Representatives of the Seventy- eighth Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the Senate concurring therein, that the Legislature of the State of South Dakota requests that the United States House of Representatives and the United States Senate enact financially sustainable, voluntary, universal, and privately administered out-patient prescription drug coverage as part of the federal Medicare program."}, {"bill_id": 18266, "bill_version_id": 97121, "bill_version": "Enrolled", "bill_version_date": "2003-02-13T08:35:04-06:00", "bill_text": ""}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 18266, "action_date": "2003-02-10T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 96903, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/96903.pdf", "status_text": "Adopt Resolution", "journal_page": 370, "committee_id_action": 798, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 56618, "president_vote": null, "Excused": [2833, 2857, 2885], "Nay": [2836, 2839, 2842, 2858, 2862, 2863, 2864, 2870, 2874, 2889, 2890, 2900, 2905, 2909, 2923, 2930, 2931, 2934], "Yea": [2837, 2841, 2843, 2844, 2845, 2846, 2848, 2855, 2859, 2860, 2861, 2866, 2869, 2871, 2872, 2873, 2875, 2877, 2879, 2884, 2888, 2892, 2893, 2894, 2895, 2896, 2898, 2902, 2906, 2907, 2910, 2911, 2912, 2913, 2914, 2915, 2917, 2919, 2920, 2922, 2924, 2925, 2929, 2932, 2933, 2936, 2937, 2938, 2899]}}, {"bill_id": 18266, "action_date": "2003-02-12T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 97096, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/97096.pdf", "status_text": "Concur In resolution", "journal_page": 429, "committee_id_action": 799, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 54461, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [2832, 2834, 2835, 2838, 2840, 2847, 2849, 2850, 2851, 2852, 2853, 2854, 2856, 2865, 2868, 2876, 2878, 2880, 2881, 2882, 2883, 2886, 2887, 2891, 2897, 2901, 2903, 2904, 2908, 2916, 2921, 2926, 2927, 2928, 2935]}}]}
