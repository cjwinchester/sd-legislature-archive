Section 2. That chapter 13-3 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: To determine the appropriate academic content standards that are in the best interests of the students, the South Dakota Board of Education shall: (1) Compare the academic content standards that the state used before the implementation of the Common Core State Standards with the Common Core State Standards; (2) Compare the academic content standards used in other states such as Indiana that have rejected the Common Core State Standards with the Common Core State Standards; and (3) Consider best practices in developing and adopting academic content standards seeking information from subject area teachers and subject area professors at the institutions under the control of the South Dakota Board of Regents. Section 3. That chapter 13-3 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: The secretary of the Department of Education shall evaluate the cost to the state associated with implementing the Smarter Balanced assessment by the schools in the state and in consultation with the Bureau of Finance and Management shall report to the Legislature the fiscal impact to the state if the South Dakota Board of Education fully implements the Common Core State Standards or discontinues the implementation of the Common Core State Standards. Section 4. That chapter 13-3 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: The South Dakota Board of Education or the secretary of the Department of Education may not enter into or renew an agreement with any organization, entity, group, or consortium that requires the state to cede any measure of autonomy or control of academic content standards and assessments including cut scores."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 5691, "action_date": "2014-01-30T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 29451, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/29451.pdf", "status_text": "First read in Senate and referred to", "journal_page": 169, "committee_id_action": 229, "committee_id_assigned": 207, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 5691, "action_date": "2014-02-13T08:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 30207, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/30207.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 207, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 5691, "action_date": "2014-02-18T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 30368, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/30368.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 207, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 5691, "action_date": "2014-02-18T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 30466, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/30466.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to the 41st legislative day", "journal_page": 341, "committee_id_action": 207, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 16133, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [846, 465], "Yea": [847, 438, 475, 493, 490]}}]}
