Any employee with more than fifteen years employment shall receive twenty working days vacation with pay for each year of employment. Such leave shall be accrued on an hourly, biweekly, semimonthly, or monthly basis as determined by the commissioner of Human Resources. No vacation hours earned may be used until the employee has served the initial six-month period.

An employee may use up to five days of the employee's sick leave annually for personal emergency reasons. Leave for personal emergencies may not be accrued from year to year.

Nothing in this section limits any other compensation or benefits due employees of the state under Title 62. Section 22. If an injured state employee's workers' compensation benefits are not equal to the employee's salary, the employee may, notwithstanding any provision in section 21 of this Act, use sick pay or vacation pay in an amount necessary to make up the difference between the employee's salary and the workers' compensation benefits. Section 23. Every state employee, who has been continuously employed in a permanent position by the State of South Dakota or any department or agency thereof for at least seven years prior to the date of the employee's retirement, voluntary resignation, layoff, termination for inability to perform job functions due to physical disability or death, shall receive payment for one-fourth of the unused leave of absence for sickness which has accrued as of the employee's final day on payroll. The payment may not exceed the sum of four hundred eighty hours. Payment shall be made in a lump sum with the employee's last payroll warrant. Any employee meeting the definition of a participant as set out in subdivision 3-13A-2(8) shall have such lump-sum payment transmitted to the fund pursuant to the provisions of \u00a7 3-13A-5. However, in the case of death of the employee, payment for such accumulated leave of absence for sickness shall be paid as provided under the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 3-8-8 to 3-8-11, inclusive.

Any donation shall be in compliance with the provisions of sections 16 and 17 of this Act. Section 27. If an employee transfers from one state department, institution, agency, or office to another state department, institution, agency, or office, the employee may transfer all unused and earned leave of absence for vacation or sickness as was allowed the employee under the provisions of sections 16 and 17 of this Act. Section 28. The provisions of sections 16 to 27, inclusive, of this Act, do not prohibit the taking of leave of absence for vacation or sickness without pay if the leave of absence is authorized and approved by the board, commission, agency, department, office, or officer employing the employee, pursuant to rules promulgated pursuant to chapter 1-26 by the commissioner of the Bureau of Human Resources. Section 29. The Civil Service Commission may, pursuant to chapter 1-26, promulgate rules to further define the types of leave permitted to be taken as sick leave, vacation leave, and leave of absence, including the following: child care, jury duty, military service, maternity, and education and other fringe benefits. Section 30. It is the policy of the State of South Dakota that citizens of this state and of the United States may not be deprived of their freedom of speech guaranteed them by the constitutions of the United States of America and of the State of South Dakota, by reason of the fact that they are state officers and employees. No state agency may pass a rule restricting or prohibiting the constitutionally guaranteed right of its employees and officers to express their opinions. Section 31. Holidays, other than Sundays, enumerated in \u00a7 1-5-1, are a benefit for any permanent state employee including those who are not scheduled to work the day on which a holiday falls. A permanent employee is eligible for holiday pay if the employee works at least one shift or is on approved paid leave during the calendar week in which the holiday falls. Part-time employees shall receive prorated holiday pay. For payroll and leave purposes, a holiday is no more than eight hours long. Section 32. Any employee of the State of South Dakota who is a certified disaster service volunteer of the American Red Cross may be granted leave from work with pay not to exceed ten days in any one calendar year to participate in disaster relief services for the American Red Cross during a State of South Dakota declared disaster, upon the request of the American Red Cross for the services of the employee and upon approval of that employee's appointing authority. However, no state employee who is needed by the employee's appointing authority to perform job-related disaster services may be granted this leave. The appointing authority shall compensate an employee granted leave under this section at the employee's regular rate of pay for regular work hours during which the employee is absent from work. Section 33. Any absence approved pursuant to section 32 of this Act for disaster service volunteers does not affect the employee's right to receive normal vacation, sick leave, bonus, advancement, and other advantages of employment. Section 34. Each appointing authority shall have exclusive authority to make the final selection of employees in the authority's respective department, bureau, division, and institution. Section 35.

Section 28. The provisions of sections 16 to 27, inclusive, of this Act, do not prohibit the taking of leave of absence for vacation or sickness without pay if the leave of absence is authorized and approved by the board, commission, agency, department, office, or officer employing the employee, pursuant to rules promulgated pursuant to chapter 1-26 by the commissioner of the Bureau of Human Resources. Section 29.

Holidays, other than Sundays, enumerated in \u00a7 1-5-1, are a benefit for any permanent state employee including those who are not scheduled to work the day on which a holiday falls.

The appointing authority shall compensate an employee granted leave under this section at the employee's regular rate of pay for regular work hours during which the employee is absent from work. Section 33.
