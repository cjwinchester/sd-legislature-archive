WHEREAS, school districts across the state, and especially in the rural areas, are struggling to keep good teachers and to fill teacher vacancies; and finding teachers for mathematics, science, special education and other areas of critical need is particularly difficult; and WHEREAS, this shortage is due to a variety of reasons including the financial hardships that many school districts have recently endured which caused them to ask teachers to do more with less, and in some instances, to freeze or even cut teacher pay for one or more years, and to reduce the benefits provided to teachers; and WHEREAS, fewer and fewer college students in the state are seeking education degrees with plans to enter the teaching profession, and many of those already in the teaching profession are leaving it to pursue other opportunities; and WHEREAS, the salaries paid to teachers in some surrounding states are significantly higher than the salaries paid to teachers in South Dakota, and that is enticing some of our teachers to cross the state border: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the House of Representatives of the Eighty-Ninth Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the Senate concurring therein, that the South Dakota Legislature recognizes that teachers are in short supply in this state, and that school districts of all sizes are now struggling to retain qualified teachers and to fill teacher vacancies; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that this Legislature joins school officials in acknowledging that teachers are a highly valued resource in this state, and in exploring tuition reimbursement programs and other programs or policies that could help attract more good people into the teaching profession in South Dakota, and to keep the good teachers that are already here."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 5309, "action_date": "2014-01-14T12:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 28475, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/28475.pdf", "status_text": "First Reading", "journal_page": 12, "committee_id_action": 231, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 5309, "action_date": "2014-01-15T13:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 28502, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/28502.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to another day", "journal_page": 37, "committee_id_action": 231, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 5309, "action_date": "2014-01-16T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 28553, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/28553.pdf", "status_text": "Adopt Resolution", "journal_page": 43, "committee_id_action": 231, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 15020, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [528, 453, 525, 467, 449, 425, 504, 481, 496, 466, 499, 521, 423, 439, 515, 506, 430, 441], "Yea": [527, 522, 433, 524, 456, 517, 519, 505, 431, 455, 509, 503, 477, 501, 520, 479, 457, 454, 523, 451, 845, 442, 476, 507, 478, 487, 500, 502, 497, 511, 512, 463, 518, 484, 462, 485, 514, 459, 464, 510, 450, 513, 468, 498, 461, 516, 508, 460, 448], "Excused": [489, 458, 480]}}, {"bill_id": 5309, "action_date": "2014-01-17T13:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 28597, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/28597.pdf", "status_text": "First Reading", "journal_page": 80, "committee_id_action": 229, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 5309, "action_date": "2014-01-21T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 28714, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/28714.pdf", "status_text": "Concurred in Resolution", "journal_page": 85, "committee_id_action": 229, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "F", "vote": {"vote_id": 15072, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [469, 437, 473, 447, 432, 483, 436, 475, 440, 493, 849, 426, 446, 494, 490], "Nay": [444, 846, 495, 472, 470, 465, 847, 443, 429, 452, 438, 526, 424, 492, 491, 428, 435, 434, 486], "Excused": [474]}}]}
