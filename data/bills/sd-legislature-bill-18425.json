The South Dakota Board of Education shall adopt promulgate rules pursuant to chapter 1-26 to establish standards for the classification and accreditation of schools within this state, to establish standards for preparation of certified personnel, to set forth procedures for determining the eligibility of school districts to receive state foundation aid effective January 1, 1997, to adopt policies and rules necessary to establish standards and procedures for vocation-technical education and to establish minimum curriculum requirements for both a basic high school program and for a recommended high school program for all public and nonpublic schools within the state.
