A power of attorney must be signed by the principal or in the principal's conscious presence by another individual directed by the principal to sign the principal's name on the power of attorney. A signature on a power of attorney is presumed to be genuine if the principal acknowledges the signature before a notary public or other individual authorized by law to take acknowledgments. Section106. (a) A power of attorney executed in this state after June 30, 2016, is valid if its execution complies with section 105 of this Act. (b) A power of attorney executed in this state before July 1, 2016, is valid if its execution complied with the law of this state as it existed at the time of execution. (c) A power of attorney executed other than in this state is valid in this state if, when the power of attorney was executed, the execution complied with: (1) The law of the jurisdiction that determines the meaning and effect of the power of attorney pursuant to section 107 of this Act; or (2) The requirements for a military power of attorney pursuant to 10 U.S.C. section 1044b , as amended. (d) Except as otherwise provided by statute other than this Act, a photocopy or electronically transmitted copy of an original power of attorney has the same effect as the original. Section 107. The meaning and effect of a power of attorney is determined by the law of the jurisdiction indicated in the power of attorney and, in the absence of an indication of jurisdiction, by the law of the jurisdiction in which the power of attorney was executed. Section108. (a) In a power of attorney, a principal may nominate a conservator of the principal's estate or guardian of the principal's person for consideration by the court if protective proceedings for the principal's estate or person are begun after the principal executes the power of attorney. Except for good cause shown or disqualification, the court shall make its appointment in accordance with the principal's most recent nomination. (b) If, after a principal executes a power of attorney, a court appoints a conservator of the principal's estate or other fiduciary charged with the management of some or all of the principal's property, the agent is accountable to the fiduciary as well as to the principal. The power of attorney is not terminated and the agent's authority continues unless limited, suspended, or terminated by the court. Section 109. (a) A power of attorney is effective when executed unless the principal provides in the power of attorney that it becomes effective at a future date or upon the occurrence of a future event or contingency. (b) If a power of attorney becomes effective upon the occurrence of a future event or contingency, the principal, in the power of attorney, may authorize one or more persons to determine in a writing or other record that the event or contingency has occurred. (c) If a power of attorney becomes effective upon the principal's incapacity and the principal has not authorized a person to determine whether the principal is incapacitated, or the person authorized is unable or unwilling to make the determination, the power of attorney becomes effective upon a determination in a writing or other record by: (1) A physician or licensed psychologist that the principal is incapacitated within the meaning of subsection 102(5)(A) of this Act; or (2) An attorney at law, a judge, or an appropriate governmental official that the principal is incapacitated within the meaning of subsection 102(5)(B) of this Act. (d) A person authorized by the principal in the power of attorney to determine that the principal is incapacitated may act as the principal's personal representative pursuant to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, sections 1171 through 1179 of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. section 1320d, as amended, and applicable regulations, to obtain access to the principal's health care information and communicate with the principal's health care provider. Section110. (a) A power of attorney terminates when: (1) The principal dies; (2) The principal becomes incapacitated, if the power of attorney is not durable; (3) The principal revokes the power of attorney; (4) The power of attorney provides that it terminates; (5) The purpose of the power of attorney is accomplished; or (6) The principal revokes the agent's authority or the agent dies, becomes incapacitated, or resigns, and the power of attorney does not provide for another agent to act under the power of attorney. (b) An agent's authority terminates when: (1) The principal revokes the authority; (2) The agent dies, becomes incapacitated, or resigns; (3) An action is filed for the dissolution or annulment of the agent's marriage to the principal or their legal separation, unless the power of attorney otherwise provides; or (4) The power of attorney terminates. (c) Unless the power of attorney otherwise provides, an agent's authority is exercisable until the authority terminates under paragraph (b), notwithstanding a lapse of time since the execution of the power of attorney. (d) Termination of an agent's authority or of a power of attorney is not effective as to the agent or another person that, without actual knowledge of the termination, acts in good faith under the power of attorney. An act so performed, unless otherwise invalid or unenforceable, binds the principal and the principal's successors in interest. (e) Incapacity of the principal of a power of attorney that is not durable does not revoke or terminate the power of attorney as to an agent or other person that, without actual knowledge of the incapacity, acts in good faith under the power of attorney. An act so performed, unless otherwise invalid or unenforceable, binds the principal and the principal's successors in interest. (f) The execution of a power of attorney does not revoke a power of attorney previously executed by the principal unless the subsequent power of attorney provides that the previous power of attorney is revoked or that all other powers of attorney are revoked. Section 111. (a) A principal may designate two or more persons to act as coagents. Unless the power of attorney otherwise provides, each coagent may exercise its authority independently. (b) A principal may designate one or more successor agents to act if an agent resigns, dies, becomes incapacitated, is not qualified to serve, or declines to serve. A principal may grant authority to designate one or more successor agents to an agent or other person designated by name, office, or function. Unless the power of attorney otherwise provides, a successor agent: (1) Has the same authority as that granted to the original agent; and (2) May not act until all predecessor agents have resigned, died, become incapacitated, are no longer qualified to serve, or have declined to serve. (c) Except as otherwise provided in the power of attorney and paragraph (d), an agent that does not participate in or conceal a breach of fiduciary duty committed by another agent, including a predecessor agent, is not liable for the actions of the other agent. (d) An agent that has actual knowledge of a breach or imminent breach of fiduciary duty by another agent shall notify the principal and, if the principal is incapacitated, take any action reasonably appropriate in the circumstances to safeguard the principal's best interest. An agent that fails to notify the principal or take action as required by this paragraph is liable for the reasonably foreseeable damages that could have been avoided if the agent had notified the principal or taken such action. Section 112. Unless the power of attorney otherwise provides, an agent is entitled to reimbursement of expenses reasonably incurred on behalf of the principal and to compensation that is reasonable under the circumstances. Section 113. Except as otherwise provided in the power of attorney, a person accepts appointment as an agent under a power of attorney by exercising authority or performing duties as an agent or by any other assertion or conduct indicating acceptance. Section 114. (a) Notwithstanding provisions in the power of attorney, an agent that has accepted appointment shall: (1) Act in accordance with the principal's reasonable expectations to the extent actually known by the agent and, otherwise, in the principal's best interest; (2) Act in good faith; and (3) Act only within the scope of authority granted in the power of attorney. (b) Except as otherwise provided in the power of attorney, an agent that has accepted appointment shall: (1) Act loyally for the principal's benefit; (2) Act so as not to create a conflict of interest that impairs the agent's ability to act impartially in the principal's best interest; (3) Act with the care, competence, and diligence ordinarily exercised by agents in similar circumstances; (4) Keep a record of all receipts, disbursements, and transactions made on behalf of the principal; (5) Cooperate with a person that has authority to make health care decisions for the principal to carry out the principal's reasonable expectations to the extent actually known by the agent and, otherwise, act in the principal's best interest; and (6) Attempt to preserve the principal's estate plan, to the extent actually known by the agent, if preserving the plan is consistent with the principal's best interest based on all relevant factors, including: (A) The value and nature of the principal's property; (B) The principal's foreseeable obligations and need for maintenance; (C) Minimization of taxes, including income, estate, inheritance, generation-skipping transfer, and gift taxes; and (D) Eligibility for a benefit, a program, or assistance under a statute or regulation. (c) An agent that acts in good faith is not liable to any beneficiary of the principal's estate plan for failure to preserve the plan. (d) An agent that acts with care, competence, and diligence for the best interest of the principal is not liable solely because the agent also benefits from the act or has an individual or conflicting interest in relation to the property or affairs of the principal. (e) If an agent is selected by the principal because of special skills or expertise possessed by the agent or in reliance on the agent's representation that the agent has special skills or expertise, the special skills or expertise must be considered in determining whether the agent has acted with care, competence, and diligence under the circumstances. (f) Absent a breach of duty to the principal, an agent is not liable if the value of the principal's property declines. (g) An agent that exercises authority to delegate to another person the authority granted by the principal or that engages another person on behalf of the principal is not liable for an act, error of judgment, or default of that person if the agent exercises care, competence, and diligence in selecting and monitoring the person. (h) Except as otherwise provided in the power of attorney, an agent is not required to disclose receipts, disbursements, or transactions conducted on behalf of the principal unless ordered by a court or requested by the principal, a guardian, a conservator, another fiduciary acting for the principal, a governmental agency having authority to protect the welfare of the principal, or, upon the death of the principal, by the personal representative or successor in interest of the principal's estate. If so requested, within thirty days the agent shall comply with the request or provide a writing or other record substantiating why additional time is needed and shall comply with the request within an additional thirty days. Section 115. A provision in a power of attorney relieving an agent of liability for breach of duty is binding on the principal and the principal's successors in interest except to the extent the provision: (1) Relieves the agent of liability for breach of duty committed dishonestly, with an improper motive, or with reckless indifference to the purposes of the power of attorney or the best interest of the principal; or (2) Was inserted as a result of an abuse of a confidential or fiduciary relationship with the principal. Section 116. (a) The following persons may petition a court to construe a power of attorney or review the agent's conduct, and grant appropriate relief: (1) The principal or the agent; (2) A guardian, conservator, or other fiduciary acting for the principal; (3) A person authorized to make health-care decisions for the principal; (4) The principal's spouse, parent, or descendant; (5) An individual who would qualify as a presumptive heir of the principal; (6) A person named as a beneficiary to receive any property, benefit, or contractual right on the principal's death or as a beneficiary of a trust created by or for the principal that has a financial interest in the principal's estate; (7) A governmental agency having regulatory authority to protect the welfare of the principal; (8) The principal's caregiver or another person that demonstrates sufficient interest in the principal's welfare; and (9) A person asked to accept the power of attorney. (b) Upon motion by the principal, the court shall dismiss a petition filed under this section, unless the court finds that the principal lacks capacity to revoke the agent's authority or the power of attorney. Section 117. An agent that violates this Act is liable to the principal or the principal's successors in interest for the amount required to: (1) Restore the value of the principal's property to what it would have been had the violation not occurred; and (2) Reimburse the principal or the principal's successors in interest for the attorney's fees and costs paid on the agent's behalf. Section 118. Unless the power of attorney provides a different method for an agent's resignation, an agent may resign by giving notice to the principal and, if the principal is incapacitated: (1) To the conservator or guardian, if one has been appointed for the principal, and a coagent or successor agent; or (2) If there is no person described in subdivision (1), to: (A) The principal's caregiver; (B) Another person reasonably believed by the agent to have sufficient interest in the principal's welfare; or (C) A governmental agency having authority to protect the welfare of the principal. Section 119. (a) For purposes of this section and section 120 of this Act, acknowledged means purportedly verified before a notary public or other individual authorized to take acknowledgements. (b) A person that in good faith accepts an acknowledged power of attorney without actual knowledge that the signature is not genuine may rely upon the presumption under section 105 of this Act that the signature is genuine. (c) A person that in good faith accepts an acknowledged power of attorney without actual knowledge that the power of attorney is void, invalid, or terminated, that the purported agent's authority is void, invalid, or terminated, or that the agent is exceeding or improperly exercising the agent's authority may rely upon the power of attorney as if the power of attorney were genuine, valid and still in effect, the agent's authority were genuine, valid and still in effect, and the agent had not exceeded and had properly exercised the authority. (d) A person that is asked to accept an acknowledged power of attorney may request, and rely upon, without further investigation: (1) An agent's certification under penalty of perjury of any factual matter concerning the principal, agent, or power of attorney; (2) An English translation of the power of attorney if the power of attorney contains, in whole or in part, language other than English; and (3) An opinion of counsel as to any matter of law concerning the power of attorney if the person making the request provides in a writing or other record the reason for the request. (e) An English translation or an opinion of counsel requested under this section must be provided at the principal's expense unless the request is made more than seven business days after the power of attorney is presented for acceptance. (f) For purposes of this section and section 120 of this Act, a person that conducts activities through employees is without actual knowledge of a fact relating to a power of attorney, a principal, or an agent if the employee conducting the transaction involving the power of attorney is without actual knowledge of the fact. Section 120. (a) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b): (1) A person shall either accept an acknowledged power of attorney or request a certification, a translation, or an opinion of counsel under section 119(d) of this Act no later than seven business days after presentation of the power of attorney for acceptance; (2) If a person requests a certification, a translation, or an opinion of counsel under section 119(d) of this Act, the person shall accept the power of attorney no later than five business days after receipt of the certification, translation, or opinion of counsel; and (3) A person may not require an additional or different form of power of attorney for authority granted in the power of attorney presented. (b) A person is not required to accept an acknowledged power of attorney if: (1) The person is not otherwise required to engage in a transaction with the principal in the same circumstances; (2) Engaging in a transaction with the agent or the principal in the same circumstances would be inconsistent with federal law; (3) The person has actual knowledge of the termination of the agent's authority or of the power of attorney before exercise of the power; (4) A request for a certification, a translation, or an opinion of counsel under section 119(d) of this Act is refused; (5) The person in good faith believes that the power is not valid or that the agent does not have the authority to perform the act requested, whether or not a certification, a translation, or an opinion of counsel under section 119(d) of this Act has been requested or provided; or (6) The person makes, or has actual knowledge that another person has made, a report to the local Adult Services and Aging Office of the Department of Social Services stating a good faith belief that the principal may be subject to physical or financial abuse, neglect, exploitation, or abandonment by the agent or a person acting for or with the agent.

This Act does not supersede any other law applicable to financial institutions or other entities, and the other law controls if inconsistent with this Act. Section 123. The remedies under this Act are not exclusive and do not abrogate any right or remedy under the law of this state other than this Act. ARTICLE 2 AUTHORITY Section 201.

(b) A reference in a power of attorney to general authority with respect to the descriptive term for a subject in sections 204 to 217, inclusive, of this Act, or a citation to a section of sections 204 to 217, inclusive, of this Act, incorporates the entire section as if it were set out in full in the power of attorney.
