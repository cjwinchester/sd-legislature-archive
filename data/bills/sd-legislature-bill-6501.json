BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 31-13-1.4 be amended to read as follows: 31-13-1.4. The board of township supervisors or board of county commissioners may designate an unimproved section line not maintained for vehicle travel as a no maintenance section line. The board shall identify the beginning and end point of the section line designated as no maintenance. The board does not have any responsibility on a no maintenance section line except to require removal or remediation of a manmade obstruction, if needed, to maintain the public access. Section 2. That \u00a7 31-13-1.5 be amended to read as follows: 31-13-1.5. The board of township supervisors or board of county commissioners shall post signs on a no maintenance section line to notify the motoring public that it is a no maintenance section line and that no travel is advised. The signs shall be posted at each entry point and at regular intervals along a no maintenance section line. A properly posted sign is prima facie evidence that adequate notice of a no maintenance section line has been given to the motoring public. Section 3. That \u00a7 31-12-26 be amended to read as follows: 31-12-26. Each board of county commissioners and county superintendent of highways in organized counties shall construct, repair, and maintain all secondary roads within the counties not included in any municipality, organized civil township, improvement district organized pursuant to chapter 7-25A, or county road district organized pursuant to chapter 31-12A. The board of county commissioners may designate any portion of the county's secondary road system as a no maintenance road. The board shall identify the beginning and end point of the road designated as no maintenance. The board does not have any responsibility on a no maintenance secondary road except to require removal or remediation of any manmade obstruction, if needed, to maintain the public access. A properly posted sign is prima facie evidence that adequate notice of a no maintenance secondary road has been given to the motoring public. Section 4. That \u00a7 31-3-6 be amended to read as follows: 31-3-6. Upon receiving the petition of two or more voters of an organized civil township or of the number of voters equal to or greater than one percent of the ballots cast for the last gubernatorial election in the affected county, the board of supervisors of the township or the board of county commissioners wherein the highway is located or is proposed to be located may, except as provided in \u00a7\u00a7 31-3-12 and 31-3-44, vacate, change, or locate any highway located or to be used within the township or county, if the public interest will be better served by the proposed vacating, changing, or locating of the highway. The petition of the voters shall set forth the beginning, course, and termination of the highway proposed to be located, changed, or vacated, together with the names of the owners of the land through which the highway may pass. The petition is not required if a board of county commissioners, by resolution, initiates a proposed vacation, change, or location of a highway. In such a case, all other procedural requirements provided for in this chapter shall apply."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 6501, "action_date": "2015-01-23T13:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 33602, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/33602.pdf", "status_text": "First read in Senate and referred to", "journal_page": 104, "committee_id_action": 284, "committee_id_assigned": 267, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 6501, "action_date": "2015-01-26T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 33734, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/33734.pdf", "status_text": "Withdrawn at the Request of the Prime Sponsor", "journal_page": 169, "committee_id_action": 284, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/6501"}
