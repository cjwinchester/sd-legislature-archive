BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 36-7-1 be amended to read as follows: 36-7-1. The practice of optometry is declared to be a profession and defined as examination of the human eye and its appendages, and the employment of any means for the measurement of the powers of visions, or any visual, muscular, neurological, interpretative, or anatomical anomalies of the visual processes, and the prescribing or employment of lenses, prisms, frames, mountings, visual training procedure, topical pharmaceutical agents, and oral analgesic agents for diagnostic and treatment purposes, and any other means or method for the correction, remedy, or relief of any insufficiencies or abnormal conditions of the visual processes of the human eye and its appendages except surgery. However, an optometrist may remove superficial foreign bodies from the eye. The prescription of contact lenses, except by a practitioner licensed under chapter 36-4, constitutes the practice of optometry. An optometrist is one who practices optometry under the provisions of this chapter. Section 2. That \u00a7 36-7-15.1 be amended to read as follows: 36-7-15.1. The State Board of Examiners in Optometry shall adopt rules pursuant to chapter 1-26 to specify additional educational qualifications and to ensure professional competence by those practitioners who apply to the board for a certification enabling them to prescribe and administer diagnostic and therapeutic topical pharmaceutical agents as described in \u00a7 36-7-1. The board shall, by rules promulgated pursuant to chapter 1-26, establish separate educational and examination requirements for the certification of optometrists for both diagnostic and therapeutic agents. The board shall make available annual, substantial, in-state pharmaceutical education for licensed optometrists. The initial educational requirements before certification are at least one hundred fifty classroom hours and at least forty hours of clinical experience in pharmaceutical education dealing with diagnosis and treatment of ocular disease. The board shall require a minimum of five hours of continuing pharmaceutical education annually for each optometrist certified for therapeutic agents. Section 3. That \u00a7 36-7-15.2 be amended to read as follows: 36-7-15.2. Only those optometrists who have satisfactorily completed a curriculum in general and ocular pharmacology at an institution accredited by a regional or professional accreditation organization which is recognized or approved by the council on postsecondary accreditation of the United States Office of Education within the Department of Health and Human Services and approved by the State Board of Examiners in Optometry are eligible to apply for the certificate issued pursuant to \u00a7 36-7-15.1. Those practitioners who have established their eligibility pursuant to this section must also pass an examination approved by the board before they may be certified to administer the topical pharmaceutical agents described by \u00a7 36-7-1. The State Board of Examiners in Optometry may promulgate rules pursuant to chapter 1-26 to establish a fee for the examination, reexamination, and certification for the use of topical pharmaceutical agents as provided by this section. Section 4. That \u00a7 36-7-15.3 be amended to read as follows: 36-7-15.3. The board, in certifying optometrists for the use of therapeutic drugs, shall require that all applicants before certification either have taken and successfully passed the treatment and management of ocular disease portion of the National Board of Examiners in Optometry test or have taken and successfully passed an examination prepared or certified by the board as covering all areas of pharmacological education provided to graduates of accredited optometric colleges. The South Dakota State University School of Pharmacy may assist the board in the formulation or administration of the examination of optometrists for competency in therapeutic drugs. The board shall provide at least annually to each licensed pharmacist in this state a list of the names, addresses, and certification numbers of all optometrists certified to prescribe therapeutic drugs. Each optometrist certified to prescribe therapeutic drugs shall communicate verbally and by a conspicuous sign adjacent to the office entrance the fact of certification to use topical eye medications. The certification notice shall also be included by the optometrist in the classified section of the telephone directory. Section 5. That \u00a7 36-7-33 be repealed. 36-7-33. No oral therapeutic agent may be prescribed by an optometrist therapeutically certified under this chapter for glaucoma or ocular hypertension."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 14451, "action_date": "1999-01-20T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 82141, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/82141.pdf", "status_text": "First read in Senate and referred to", "journal_page": 130, "committee_id_action": 629, "committee_id_assigned": 603, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 14451, "action_date": "1999-01-25T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 82143, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/82143.pdf", "status_text": "Re-referred to", "journal_page": 175, "committee_id_action": 629, "committee_id_assigned": 606, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 14451, "action_date": "1999-02-01T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 82045, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/82045.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 606, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 14451, "action_date": "1999-02-01T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 82045, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/82045.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass,", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 606, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "F", "vote": {"vote_id": 42857, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [2224, 2263, 2293, 2199, 2206], "Yea": [2252, 2259]}}, {"bill_id": 14451, "action_date": "1999-02-01T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 82045, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/82045.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to 41st legislative day", "journal_page": 271, "committee_id_action": 606, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 42859, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [2224, 2263, 2199, 2206], "Nay": [2252, 2259, 2293]}}, {"bill_id": 14451, "action_date": "1999-02-08T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 82151, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/82151.pdf", "status_text": "Recalled from committee (Rule 7-7)", "journal_page": 362, "committee_id_action": 629, "committee_id_assigned": 606, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 14451, "action_date": "1999-02-08T16:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 81855, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/81855.pdf", "status_text": "Do not Pass", "journal_page": 391, "committee_id_action": 606, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 41093, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [2224, 2263, 2199, 2206], "Nay": [2252, 2259, 2293]}}, {"bill_id": 14451, "action_date": "1999-02-11T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 82154, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/82154.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass,", "journal_page": 451, "committee_id_action": 629, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "F", "vote": {"vote_id": 41347, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [2199, 2201, 2202, 2205, 2206, 2215, 2224, 2225, 2230, 2235, 2239, 2241, 2242, 2263, 2270, 2274, 2275, 2294, 2299], "Yea": [2217, 2221, 2226, 2234, 2246, 2251, 2252, 2258, 2259, 2269, 2280, 2283, 2285, 2289, 2292, 2293]}}, {"bill_id": 14451, "action_date": "1999-02-11T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 82154, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/82154.pdf", "status_text": "Intent to reconsider", "journal_page": 451, "committee_id_action": 629, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}]}
