Section 2. That \u00a7 38-35-3 be AMENDED: 38-35-3. After the department receives approval by the United States Secretary of Agriculture for the state plan submitted pursuant to \u00a7 38-35-15, any person seeking to purchase, receive, or obtain industrial hemp, other than industrial hemp product and industrial hemp stalk bales, for planting, storing, propagating, or producing shall apply to the secretary for a grower license on an application form prescribed by the department and submit a nonrefundable annual application fee.

At the discretion of the secretary, a grower licensee may be inspected and samples collected no more than thirty days before the hemp is harvested. The grower licensee shall contact the Department of Public Safety department prior to harvest in order to ensure a reasonable amount of time to schedule an inspection. The grower licensee is required to be present during the inspection. No harvested lot of hemp shall must be commingled with another harvested lot of hemp and no hemp may leave the dominion of control of the grower licensee until the grower licensee receives a laboratory result from the department that confirms each lot complies with 7 U.S.C. Chapter 38, Subchapter VII, as provided in 7 C.F.R \u00a7\u00a7 990.70(d) and 990.71(d) in effect as of March 22, 2021. Any location of the processor licensee is subject to random inspection.

The department compliance testing must be conducted by a laboratory approved by the Drug Enforcement Administration. The laboratory shall report the total delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol concentration level and the measurement of uncertainty for each sample tested pursuant to this section. If a test reveals a total delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol concentration of more than three-tenths of one percent but not more than five-tenths of one percent, the licensee may request a retest at the licensee's expense. If upon the retesting, the total delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol concentration exceeds three-tenths of one percent, the entire lot from which the noncompliant sample was collected shall must either be destroyed or remediated and retested according to the United States Department of Agriculture guidelines. However, a sample that tests a result within a measurement of uncertainty that produces a range that includes a total delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol concentration of three-tenths of one percent is compliant for the purposes of this chapter."}, {"bill_id": 24685, "bill_version_id": 266631, "bill_version": "Enrolled", "bill_version_date": "2024-02-27T11:24:39.933-06:00", "bill_text": "ENTITLED An Act to revise provisions regarding industrial hemp.
