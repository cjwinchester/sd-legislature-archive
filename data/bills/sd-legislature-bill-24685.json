In addition, \"lot\" means the terms, \"farm,\" \"tract,\" \"field,\" and \"subfield\" used by the United States Department of Agriculture Farm Service Agency to mean \"lot\"; (8)(9) \"Measurement of uncertainty,\" the parameter associated with the result of a measurement, that characterizes the dispersion of the values that could reasonably be attributed to the particular quantity subject to measurement; (9)(10) \"Process\" or \"processing,\" to render raw industrial hemp plants or plant parts from their natural or original state to an initial processed form.

Section 2. That \u00a7 38-35-3 be AMENDED: 38-35-3. After the department receives approval by the United States Secretary of Agriculture for the state plan submitted pursuant to \u00a7 38-35-15, any person seeking to purchase, receive, or obtain industrial hemp, other than industrial hemp product and industrial hemp stalk bales, for planting, storing, propagating, or producing shall apply to the secretary for a grower license on an application form prescribed by the department and submit a nonrefundable annual application fee. The secretary shall deposit fees collected under this chapter in the hemp regulatory program fund.

At the discretion of the secretary, a grower licensee may be inspected and samples collected no more than thirty days before the hemp is harvested. The grower licensee shall contact the Department of Public Safety department prior to harvest in order to ensure a reasonable amount of time to schedule an inspection. The grower licensee is required to be present during the inspection. No harvested lot of hemp shall must be commingled with another harvested lot of hemp and no hemp may leave the dominion of control of the grower licensee until the grower licensee receives a laboratory result from the department that confirms each lot complies with 7 U.S.C. Chapter 38, Subchapter VII, as provided in 7 C.F.R \u00a7\u00a7 990.70(d) and 990.71(d) in effect as of March 22, 2021. Any location of the processor licensee is subject to random inspection. The processor licensee is required to be present during the inspection. At the discretion of the secretary, a research licensee may be inspected, and samples may be collected. The research licensee is required to be present during the inspection. Section 6. That \u00a7 38-35-14 be AMENDED: 38-35-14. The department compliance testing must be conducted by a laboratory approved by the Drug Enforcement Administration. The laboratory shall report the total delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol concentration level and the measurement of uncertainty for each sample tested pursuant to this section. If a test reveals a total delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol concentration of more than three-tenths of one percent but not more than five-tenths of one percent, the licensee may request a retest at the licensee's expense. If upon the retesting, the total delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol concentration exceeds three-tenths of one percent, the entire lot from which the noncompliant sample was collected shall must either be destroyed or remediated and retested according to the United States Department of Agriculture guidelines. However, a sample that tests a result within a measurement of uncertainty that produces a range that includes a total delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol concentration of three-tenths of one percent is compliant for the purposes of this chapter."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 24685, "action_date": "2024-01-23T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 261480, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/261480.pdf", "status_text": "First read in Senate and referred to", "journal_page": 146, "committee_id_action": 1219, "committee_id_assigned": 1208, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 24685, "action_date": "2024-01-30T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 262919, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/262919.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 1208, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 24685, "action_date": "2024-01-30T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 262921, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/262921.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass", "journal_page": 3, "committee_id_action": 1208, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 78973, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [4515, 4523, 4529, 4537, 4567, 4490, 4541]}}, {"bill_id": 24685, "action_date": "2024-01-30T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 262921, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/262921.pdf", "status_text": "Certified uncontested, placed on consent", "journal_page": 3, "committee_id_action": 1208, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 24685, "action_date": "2024-01-31T14:30:00-06:00", "document_id": 263449, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/263449.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass", "journal_page": 221, "committee_id_action": 1219, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 79042, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [4477, 4479, 4480, 4481, 4487, 4488, 4490, 4498, 4502, 4507, 4508, 4512, 4515, 4516, 4517, 4523, 4526, 4529, 4536, 4537, 4541, 4547, 4550, 4554, 4558, 4559, 4564, 4567, 4572, 4574, 4576], "Excused": [4493, 4501, 4573]}}, {"bill_id": 24685, "action_date": "2024-02-01T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 264174, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/264174.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 227, "committee_id_action": 1197, "committee_id_assigned": 1191, "result": "N", "vote": {}}]}
