BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 13-27-3 be amended to read as follows: 13-27-3. A child shall be excused from school attendance, pursuant to \u00a7 13-27-2, because the child is otherwise provided with alternative instruction for an equivalent period of time, as in the public schools, in the basic skills of language arts and mathematics. The parent or guardian of the child shall identify in the application the place where the child will be instructed and any individual who will instruct the child. The individuals are not required to be certified. The secretary of the Department of Education may investigate and determine whether the instruction is being provided. Failure to provide instruction is grounds for the school board, upon thirty days' notice, to revoke the excuse from school attendance. The secretary of the Department of Education may inspect the records of an alternative education program with fourteen days' written notice if the secretary has probable cause to believe the program is not in compliance with this section. The records to be inspected are limited to attendance and evidence showing academic progress. No individual may instruct more than twenty-two children. All instructions shall be given so as to lead to a mastery of the English language. Children receiving alternative instruction who are in grades two, four, eight, and eleven shall take a nationally standardized achievement test of the basic skills. The test may be the test provided by the state and used in the public school district where the child is instructed or another nationally standardized achievement test chosen by and provided at the expense of the child's parent, guardian, or school giving alternative instruction. The test may be monitored by the local school district where the child is instructed. Any test given to a child pursuant to this section shall be monitored by the superintendent or a representative of the superintendent of the local school district where the child is instructed. The test shall be administered at a time and place agreed to by the parent, guardian, or other person providing the alternative instruction and the representative of the local school district who will monitor the test."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 19058, "action_date": "2004-01-23T12:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 99768, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/99768.pdf", "status_text": "First read in Senate and referred to", "journal_page": 132, "committee_id_action": 832, "committee_id_assigned": 807, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 19058, "action_date": "2004-02-03T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 100492, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/100492.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 807, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 19058, "action_date": "2004-02-05T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 100683, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/100683.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 807, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 19058, "action_date": "2004-02-05T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 100683, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/100683.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass,", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 807, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "F", "vote": {"vote_id": 56969, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [3064, 3101, 3139, 3120], "Yea": [3097, 3128, 3079]}}, {"bill_id": 19058, "action_date": "2004-02-05T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 100683, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/100683.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to 36th legislative day", "journal_page": 343, "committee_id_action": 807, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 56970, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [3064, 3101, 3139, 3079, 3120], "Nay": [3097, 3128]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/19058"}
