Net worth may be determined on a consolidated basis if the seller is at least eighty percent owned by one person and that person expressly guarantees the obligations of the seller with regard to the offer or sale of any business opportunity claimed to be exempt under this subdivision. The director may, by rules adopted pursuant to chapter 1-26, withdraw or further condition the availability of this exemption; (4) Any offer or sale of a business opportunity if the purchaser has a net worth of not less than two hundred fifty thousand dollars.
