The South Dakota State Board of Medical and Osteopathic Examiners shall have authority over and be responsible provide for the placement of physician's assistants. For the initial application, the secretary of the state department of health and the appropriate board or boards of county commissioners or governing board or boards of a municipality or municipalities, shall submit written recommendations as to the board's placement. The board shall notify the physician who has made application to place a physician's assistant of the board's affirmative or negative decision regarding the placement. In placing physician's assistants the board may consider: (1) The distance between the employer physician and the physician's assistant; (2) The ability of the employer physician to adequately provide supervision as required by law and good medical practice; and (3) The consistency between the type and scope of medical practice of the employer physician and the proposed medical practice of the physician's assistant. In addition, if the proposed office of the physician's assistant is separate from the main office of the employer physician, the board may also consider the availability or nonavailability of medical services in the proposed location of the physician's assistant and such specific requirements as the board may provide as a condition precedent to approving a particular placement."}, {"bill_id":
