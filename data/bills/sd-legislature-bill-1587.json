That chapter 13-32 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: If a student is expelled from school as provided in \u00a7 13-32-4, the school board may grant the student an early reinstatement allowing the student to return to school before the end of the period of expulsion. Section 2. That chapter 13-32 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Any early reinstatement granted by a school board pursuant to section 1 of this Act may include one or more specific conditions established by the school board that the expelled student must meet, either prior to the granting of the early reinstatement or after the early reinstatement is granted and before the end of the period of expulsion. Any early reinstatement conditions established by the school board for an expelled student shall pertain to the reasons why the student was expelled, and the board shall provide notice of any early reinstatement conditions to the student's parent or guardian or to the student, if the student is at least eighteen years of age or is an emancipated minor, at the time the student is expelled. Section 3. That chapter 13-32 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: If the superintendent of a school district determines that an expelled student has met the early reinstatement conditions established pursuant to section 2 of this Act that the student is required to meet before the student may be granted early reinstatement, the superintendent may grant the student early reinstatement and allow the student to return to school. If a student violates an early reinstatement condition that the student was required to meet after the student's early reinstatement, but before the end of the expulsion period, the superintendent of the school district may revoke the student's early reinstatement. Within five days after revoking an early reinstatement, the superintendent shall provide written notice of the revocation including any early reinstatement condition that was violated by the student to the student's parent or guardian or to the student, if the student is at least eighteen years of age or an emancipated minor. If a student's early reinstatement is revoked, the student's expulsion shall continue until the end of the original period of expulsion unless the student's expulsion is firearm-related and the original period of expulsion is modified by the superintendent pursuant to \u00a7 13-32-4. Section 4. That chapter 13-32 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: The administrative due process procedures established in ARSD 24:07:04 for the protection of students' rights in an expulsion procedure apply to the early reinstatement process established in this Act, and the South Dakota Board of Education may promulgate rules pursuant to chapter 1-26 to establish additional procedures for the early reinstatement process, including the development of early reinstatement conditions by school boards."}, {"bill_id": 1587, "bill_version_id": 12816, "bill_version": "Enrolled",
