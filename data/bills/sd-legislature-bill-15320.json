If any person's capacity to give informed consent is challenged, the person, a qualified mental retardation professional, physician, or interested person may file a petition with the court to determine competency to give consent; (2) The guardian of the person with a developmental disability, if the guardian is legally empowered to execute such consent; or (3) The parent or guardian of the person with a developmental disability, if the person with a developmental disability is less than eighteen years of age. No person with a developmental disability who is subject to an order of guardianship may be subjected to experimental research or hazardous treatment procedures without prior authorization of the circuit court. Section 87. That chapter 27B-8 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: The receipt of services and supports pursuant to this chapter does not operate to deprive any person with a developmental disability of any other rights, benefits, or privileges, does not cause the person with a developmental disability to be declared legally incompetent, and may not be construed to interfere with the rights and privileges of parents or guardians regarding the minor child. No agency, community service provider, facility, school, or person who receives public funds and provides services to persons with developmental disabilities may engage in the following practices: (1) Corporal punishment - physical or verbal abuse, such as shaking, screaming, swearing, name calling, or any other activity that would be damaging to a person's physical well- being or self-respect; (2) Seclusion - placement of a person alone in a room or other area from which egress is prevented; (3) Denial of food - preventing a person from having access to a nutritionally adequate diet as a means of modifying behavior. Persons enrolled in residential programs or living units are expected to partake in meals at a predetermined scheduled time. No person with a developmental disability receiving services may discipline other persons with developmental disabilities receiving services, and no community service provider or facility may mistreat, exploit, neglect, or abuse any person with a developmental disability. Section 88. That chapter 27B-8 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: No agency, community service provider, facility, or school may retaliate against any staff who reports in good faith suspected abuse, neglect, or exploitation, or against any person with a developmental disability with respect to any report. An alleged perpetrator cannot self-report solely for the purpose of claiming retaliation. There is a rebuttable presumption of retaliation for any adverse actions taken within ninety days of a report of abuse, neglect, or exploitation. Adverse action means only those adverse actions arising solely from the filing of an abuse report. For the purposes of this chapter, adverse action means any action taken by a community service provider or facility against the person making the report or against the person with a developmental disability because of the report and includes: (1) Discharge or transfer from the community service provider or facility except for clinical reasons; (2) Discharge from or termination of employment; (3) Demotion or reduction in remuneration for services; or (4) Restriction or prohibition of access to services and supports or the persons served.

No person's incoming or outgoing correspondence shall be opened, delayed, held, or censored by any person; (3) Receive and send packages. No person's outgoing packages may be opened, delayed, held, or censored by any person; (4) Reasonable access to telephones, both to make and to receive calls in privacy, and reasonable and frequent opportunities to meet with visitors; and (5) Suitable opportunities for interaction with others of the person's own choosing.

That chapter 27B-8 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: If the community service provider or facility and the person with a developmental disability and the person's parent, if a minor, or the person's guardian consent, information may be disclosed to providers of supports and services to the person with a developmental disability, or to the person with a developmental disability, or to any other person or agency, if, in the judgment of the community service provider or facility, the disclosure would not be detrimental to the person with a developmental disability. Section 93. That chapter 27B-8 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: If information is disclosed, the identity of the person to whom it pertains shall be protected and may not be disclosed unless it is germane to the authorized purpose for which disclosure was sought. If practicable, no other information may be disclosed unless it is germane to the authorized purpose for which disclosure was made. Section 94. That chapter 27B-8 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Any person receiving information made confidential by section 92 of this Act shall disclose the information to others only to the extent consistent with the authorized purpose for which the information was released. Section 95. That chapter 27B-8 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: The Legislature hereby finds that: (1) Research does not support the long-term efficacy of aversive behavioral intervention; (2) The use of aversive or abusive treatment raises disturbing legal and ethical issues, and may well deprive the recipient of constitutional or statutory rights and be outside the ethical guidelines imposed upon the treatment professional; (3) Any person with a disability has the same right to be treated with dignity and respect as any other citizen; and (4) The use of aversive and abusive treatments on any person with a disability diminishes the dignity and humanity of the treatment professional and the person with a disability. The Legislature opposes any treatment or practice which violates the right to freedom from harm. The Legislature promotes activities that lead to implementation and dissemination of positive intervention alternatives. Section 96. That chapter 27B-8 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: No person may use aversive intervention techniques on a person with a developmental disability. Section 97. That chapter 27B-8 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: The rights of any person with a developmental disability receiving services may only be restricted as a result of due process in accordance with statute and the rules of the Department of Human Services. The rights of any person with a developmental disability as specified in this chapter may be suspended to protect that person from endangering self or others. In order to provide specific services or supports to the person with a developmental disability, such rights may be suspended only by due process that will promote the least restriction on the person's rights.

Behavior intervention programs shall be developed in conjunction with the interdisciplinary team and implemented in accordance with section 97 of this Act. Section 101. That chapter 27B-8 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: The use of any highly restrictive procedures, including restraints and time-out, shall be described in written behavior intervention programs. Use of restraints shall be applied only in an emergency if alternative techniques have failed. Physical restraint intended to restrict the movement or normal functioning of a portion of a person's body through direct contact by staff, shall be employed only if necessary to protect the person with a developmental disability from immediate injury to self or others. No physical restraint may be employed as punishment, for the convenience of staff, or as a substitute for a program of services and supports. Physical restraint shall be applied only after alternative techniques have failed and only if such restraint is imposed in the least possible restriction consistent with its purpose. Mechanical restraint using mechanical devices intended to restrict the movement or normal functioning of a portion of a person's body is subject to special review and oversight, as defined in rules promulgated pursuant to chapter 1-26. Any mechanical restraint shall be designed and used so as not to cause physical injury to the person with a developmental disability and so as to cause the least possible discomfort. No chemical restraint and medication may be used excessively, as punishment, for the convenience of staff, as a substitute for a program, or in quantities that interfere with a person's developmental program. In accordance with statute and the rules promulgated pursuant to chapter 1-26, due process shall be assured pursuant to section 97 of this Act for the use of physical, mechanical, or chemical restraints, including their use in an emergency or on a continuing basis. Section 102. That chapter 27B-8 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Time-out rooms used for separating a person with a developmental disability from other persons receiving services and group activities may be employed only under close and direct staff supervision and only as a technique in behavior intervention programs.
