BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That chapter 25-7A be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Any attorney whose client is to receive a sum of money as a result of any claim or legal proceeding in which the attorney represented the client shall, at least fourteen days prior to dispersing any portion of the recovery to the client, request the Department of Social Services to advise the attorney whether the client owes any past due child support. The request shall be in writing and shall include the client's full name, current address, telephone number, social security number, and date of birth. If, prior to the expiration of the fourteen day period, the attorney receives written notice from the department of any past due child support, the attorney shall withhold an amount equal to the past due support from the client's portion of the recovery and remit the amount to the department. If the attorney receives no such notice from the department prior to the expiration of the fourteen day period, the attorney may disperse the entirety of the recovery to the client. Any amount owed to the department may only be withheld from the client's portion of the recovery and is secondary to payment of any fees and costs owed to the attorney and any liens or subrogation interests. In no event is the department entitled to receive more than the client's portion of the recovery."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 19909, "action_date": "2005-01-26T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 103314, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/103314.pdf", "status_text": "First read in Senate and referred to", "journal_page": 189, "committee_id_action": 861, "committee_id_assigned": 839, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 19909, "action_date": "2005-01-31T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 103659, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/103659.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 839, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 19909, "action_date": "2005-02-02T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 103903, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/103903.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 839, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 19909, "action_date": "2005-02-02T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 103903, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/103903.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to 41st legislative day", "journal_page": 295, "committee_id_action": 839, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 61475, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [3179], "Yea": [3201, 3202, 3217, 3236, 3150], "Excused": [3205]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/19909"}
