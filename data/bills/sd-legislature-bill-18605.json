However, in the case of an application by an agent for a broker-dealer that is a member of a self-regulatory organization or by an individual for registration as an investment adviser representative, a denial order may not be based on this paragraph if the individual has successfully completed all examinations required by subsection (e). The director may require an applicant for registration under Section 402 or 404 who has not been registered in a state within the two years preceding the filing of an application in this state to successfully complete an examination. (e) Examinations. A rule adopted or order issued under this Act may require that an examination, including an examination developed or approved by an organization of securities regulators, be successfully completed by a class of individuals or all individuals. An order issued under this Act may waive, in whole or in part, an examination as to an individual and a rule adopted under this Act may waive, in whole or in part, an examination as to a class of individuals if the director determines that the examination is not necessary or appropriate in the public interest and for the protection of investors. (f) Summary process.

If a hearing is not requested and none is ordered by the director within thirty days after the date of service of the order, the order becomes final by operation of law. If a hearing is requested or ordered, the director, after notice of and opportunity for hearing to each person subject to the order, may modify or vacate the order or extend the order until final determination. (g) Procedural requirements. An order issued may not be issued under this section, except under subsection (f), without: (1) Appropriate notice to the applicant or registrant; (2) Opportunity for hearing; and (3) Findings of fact and conclusions of law in a record in accordance with chapter 1-26.

(i) Limit on investigation or proceeding. The director may not institute a proceeding under subsection(a), (b), or (c) based solely on material facts actually known by the director unless an investigation or the proceeding is instituted within one year after the director actually acquires knowledge of the material facts.

(b) Rules defining fraud. A rule adopted under this Act may define an act, practice, or course of business of an investment adviser or an investment adviser representative, other than a supervised person of a federal covered investment adviser, as fraudulent, deceptive, or manipulative, and prescribe means reasonably designed to prevent investment advisers and investment adviser representatives, other than supervised persons of a federal covered investment adviser, from engaging in acts, practices, and courses of business defined as fraudulent, deceptive, or manipulative. (c) Rules specifying contents of advisory contract. A rule adopted under this Act may specify the contents of an investment advisory contract entered into, extended, or renewed by an investment adviser. Section 31. Section 503. (a) Civil.

Section 34. Section 506. The filing of an application for registration, a registration statement, a notice filing under this Act, the registration of a person, the notice filing by a person, or the registration of a security under this Act does not constitute a finding by the director that a record filed under this Act is true, complete, and not misleading. The filing or registration or the availability of an exemption, exception, preemption, or exclusion for a security or a transaction does not mean that the director has passed upon the merits or qualifications of, or recommended or given approval to, a person, security, or transaction. It is unlawful to make, or cause to be made, to a purchaser, customer, client, or prospective customer or client a representation inconsistent with this section. Section 35. Section 507.

A subsequent violation is a Class 3 felony. (b) Criminal reference not required. The Attorney General or the proper prosecuting attorney with or without a reference from the director, may institute criminal proceedings under this Act.

(b) Liability of seller to purchaser. A person is liable to the purchaser if the person sells a security in violation of Section 301 or, by means of an untrue statement of a material fact or an omission to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statement made, in light of the circumstances under which it is made, not misleading, the purchaser not knowing the untruth or omission and the seller not sustaining the burden of proof that the seller did not know and, in the exercise of reasonable care, could not have known of the untruth or omission. An action under this subsection is governed by the following: (1) The purchaser may maintain an action to recover the consideration paid for the security, less the amount of any income received on the security, and interest at Category D, \u00a7 54-3-16 from the date of the purchase, costs, and reasonable attorneys' fees determined by the court, upon the tender of the security, or for actual damages as provided in paragraph (3).

(c) Liability of purchaser to seller. A person is liable to the seller if the person buys a security by means of an untrue statement of a material fact or omission to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statement made, in light of the circumstances under which it is made, not misleading, the seller not knowing of the untruth or omission, and the purchaser not sustaining the burden of proof that the purchaser did not know, and in the exercise of reasonable care, could not have known of the untruth or omission.

If the purchaser no longer owns the security, the seller may recover actual damages as provided in paragraph (3). (3) Actual damages in an action arising under this subsection are the difference between the price at which the security was sold and the value the security would have had at the time of the sale in the absence of the purchaser's conduct causing liability, and interest at Category D \u00a7 54-3-16 from the date of the sale of the security, costs, and reasonable attorneys' fees determined by the court.

A person that receives directly or indirectly any consideration for providing investment advice to another person and that employs a device, scheme, or artifice to defraud the other person or engages in an act, practice, or course of business that operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit on the other person, is liable to the other person. An action under this subsection is governed by the following: (1) The person defrauded may maintain an action to recover the consideration paid for the advice and the amount of any actual damages caused by the fraudulent conduct, interest at Category D \u00a7 54-3-16 from the date of the fraudulent conduct, costs, and reasonable attorneys' fees determined by the court, less the amount of any income received as a result of the fraudulent conduct.

(g) Joint and several liability. The following persons are liable jointly and severally with and to the same extent as persons liable under subsections (b) through (f): (1) A person that directly or indirectly controls a person liable under subsections (b) through (f), unless the controlling person sustains the burden of proof that the person did not know, and in the exercise of reasonable care could not have known, of the existence of conduct by reason of which the liability is alleged to exist; (2) An individual who is a managing partner, executive officer, or director of a person liable under subsections (b) through (f), including an individual having a similar status or performing similar functions, unless the individual sustains the burden of proof that the individual did not know and, in the exercise of reasonable care could not have known, of the existence of conduct by reason of which the liability is alleged to exist; (3) An individual who is an employee of or associated with a person liable under subsections (b) through (f) and who materially aids the conduct giving rise to the liability, unless the individual sustains the burden of proof that the individual did not know and, in the exercise of reasonable care could not have known, of the existence of conduct by reason of which the liability is alleged to exist; and (4) A person that is a broker-dealer, agent, investment adviser, or investment adviser representative that materially aids the conduct giving rise to the liability under subsections (b) through (f), unless the person sustains the burden of proof that the person did not know and, in the exercise of reasonable care could not have known, of the existence of conduct by reason of which liability is alleged to exist.

The testimony, record, or other evidence compelled under such an order may not be used, directly or indirectly, against the individual in a criminal case, except in a prosecution for perjury or contempt or otherwise failing to comply with the order. (f) Assistance to securities regulator of another jurisdiction. At the request of the securities regulator of another state or a foreign jurisdiction, the director may provide assistance if the requesting regulator states that it is conducting an investigation to determine whether a person has violated, is violating, or is about to violate a law or rule of the other state or foreign jurisdiction relating to securities matters that the requesting regulator administers or enforces. The director may provide the assistance by using the authority to investigate and the powers conferred by this section as the director determines is necessary or appropriate. The assistance may be provided without regard to whether the conduct described in the request would also constitute a violation of this Act or other law of this state if occurring in this state. In deciding whether to provide the assistance, the director may consider whether the requesting regulator is permitted and has agreed to provide assistance reciprocally within its state or foreign jurisdiction to the director on securities matters when requested; whether compliance with the request would violate or prejudice the public policy of this state; and the availability of resources and employees of the director to carry out the request for assistance. Section 41. Section 603. (a) Civil action instituted by director. If the director believes that a person has engaged, is engaging, or is about to engage in an act, practice, or course of business constituting a violation of this Act or a rule adopted or order issued under this Act or that a person has, is, or is about to engage in an act, practice, or course of business that materially aids a violation of this Act or a rule adopted or order issued under this Act, the director may maintain an action in the circuit court to enjoin the act, practice, or course of business and to enforce compliance with this Act or a rule adopted or order issued under this Act.

(c) No bond required. The director may not be required to post a bond in an action or proceeding under this Act. Section 42. Section 604. (a) Issuance of an order or notice. If the director determines that a person has engaged, is engaging, or is about to engage in an act, practice, or course of business constituting a violation of this Act or a rule adopted or order issued under this Act or that a person has materially aided, is materially aiding, or is about to materially aid an act, practice, or course of business constituting a violation of this Act or a rule adopted or order issued under this Act, the director may: (1) Issue an order directing the person to cease and desist from engaging in the act, practice, or course of business or to take other action necessary or appropriate to comply with this Act; (2) Issue an order denying, suspending, revoking, or conditioning the exemptions for a broker-dealer under Section 401(b)(1)(D) or (F) or an investment adviser under Section 403(b)(1)(C); or (3) Issue an order under Section 204.

The order must include a statement whether the director will seek a civil penalty or costs of the investigation, a statement of the reasons for the order, and notice that, within fifteen days after receipt of a request in a record from the person, the matter will be scheduled for a hearing. If a person subject to the order does not request a hearing and none is ordered by the director within thirty days after the date of service of the order, the order, which may include a civil penalty or costs of the investigation if a civil penalty or costs were sought in the statement accompanying the order, becomes final as to that person by operation of law. If a hearing is requested or ordered, the director, after notice of and opportunity for hearing to each person subject to the order, may modify or vacate the order or extend it until final determination. (c) Procedure for final order. If a hearing is requested or ordered pursuant to subsection (b), a hearing must be held pursuant to chapter 1-26. A final order may not be issued unless the director makes findings of fact and conclusions of law in a record pursuant to chapter 1-26. The final order may make final, vacate, or modify the order issued under subsection (a). (d) Civil penalty. In a final order under subsection (c), the director may impose a civil penalty up to ten thousand dollars for each violation. (e) Costs.

(f) Filing of certified final order with court; effect of filing. If a petition for judicial review of a final order is not filed in accordance with Section 609, the director may file a certified copy of the final order with the clerk of a court of competent jurisdiction. The order so filed has the same effect as a judgment of the court and may be recorded, enforced, or satisfied in the same manner as a judgment of the court. (g) Enforcement by court; further civil penalty. If a person does not comply with an order under this section, the director may petition a court of competent jurisdiction to enforce the order. The court may not require the director to post a bond in an action or proceeding under this section. If the court finds, after service and opportunity for hearing, that the person was not in compliance with the order, the court may adjudge the person in civil contempt of the order.

The following persons are liable jointly and severally with and to the same extent as persons liable under subsections (b) through (f): (1) A person that directly or indirectly controls a person liable under subsections (b) through (f), unless the controlling person sustains the burden of proof that the person did not know, and in the exercise of reasonable care could not have known, of the existence of conduct by reason of which the liability is alleged to exist; (2) An individual who is a managing partner, executive officer, or director of a person liable under subsections (b) through (f), including an individual having a similar status or performing similar functions, unless the individual sustains the burden of proof that the individual did not know and, in the exercise of reasonable care could not have known, of the existence of conduct by reason of which the liability is alleged to exist; (3) An individual who is an employee of or associated with a person liable under subsections (b) through (f) and who materially aids the conduct giving rise to the liability, unless the individual sustains the burden of proof that the individual did not know and, in the exercise of reasonable care could not have known, of the existence of conduct by reason of which the liability is alleged to exist; and (4) A person that is a broker-dealer, agent, investment adviser, or investment adviser representative that materially aids the conduct giving rise to the liability under subsections (b) through (f), unless the person sustains the burden of proof that the person did not know and, in the exercise of reasonable care could not have known, of the existence of conduct by reason of which liability is alleged to exist.

(a) Authority to investigate. The director may: (1) Conduct public or private investigations within or outside of this state which the director considers necessary or appropriate to determine whether a person has violated, is violating, or is about to violate this Act or a rule adopted or order issued under this Act, or to aid in the enforcement of this Act or in the adoption of rules and forms under this Act; (2) Require or permit a person to testify, file a statement, or produce a record, under oath or otherwise as the director determines, as to all the facts and circumstances concerning a matter to be investigated or about which an action or proceeding is to be instituted; and (3) Publish a record concerning an action, proceeding, or an investigation under, or a violation of, this Act or a rule adopted or order issued under this Act if the director determines it is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and for the protection of investors.

If the individual refuses to testify, file a statement, or produce a record or other evidence on the basis of the individual's privilege against self-incrimination, the director may apply to the circuit court to compel the testimony, the filing of the statement, the production of the record, or the giving of other evidence. The testimony, record, or other evidence compelled under such an order may not be used, directly or indirectly, against the individual in a criminal case, except in a prosecution for perjury or contempt or otherwise failing to comply with the order.

The director may provide the assistance by using the authority to investigate and the powers conferred by this section as the director determines is necessary or appropriate. The assistance may be provided without regard to whether the conduct described in the request would also constitute a violation of this Act or other law of this state if occurring in this state. In deciding whether to provide the assistance, the director may consider whether the requesting regulator is permitted and has agreed to provide assistance reciprocally within its state or foreign jurisdiction to the director on securities matters when requested; whether compliance with the request would violate or prejudice the public policy of this state; and the availability of resources and employees of the director to carry out the request for assistance. Section 41. Section 603. (a) Civil action instituted by director. If the director believes that a person has engaged, is engaging, or is about to engage in an act, practice, or course of business constituting a violation of this Act or a rule adopted or order issued under this Act or that a person has, is, or is about to engage in an act, practice, or course of business that materially aids a violation of this Act or a rule adopted or order issued under this Act, the director may maintain an action in the circuit court to enjoin the act, practice, or course of business and to enforce compliance with this Act or a rule adopted or order issued under this Act.

If the director determines that a person has engaged, is engaging, or is about to engage in an act, practice, or course of business constituting a violation of this Act or a rule adopted or order issued under this Act or that a person has materially aided, is materially aiding, or is about to materially aid an act, practice, or course of business constituting a violation of this Act or a rule adopted or order issued under this Act, the director may: (1) Issue an order directing the person to cease and desist from engaging in the act, practice, or course of business or to take other action necessary or appropriate to comply with this Act; (2) Issue an order denying, suspending, revoking, or conditioning the exemptions for a broker-dealer under Section 401(b)(1)(D) or (F) or an investment adviser under Section 403(b)(1)(C); or (3) Issue an order under Section 204. (b) Summary process. An order under subsection (a) is effective on the date of issuance. Upon issuance of the order, the director shall promptly serve each person subject to the order with a copy of the order and a notice that the order has been entered. The order must include a statement whether the director will seek a civil penalty or costs of the investigation, a statement of the reasons for the order, and notice that, within fifteen days after receipt of a request in a record from the person, the matter will be scheduled for a hearing. If a person subject to the order does not request a hearing and none is ordered by the director within thirty days after the date of service of the order, the order, which may include a civil penalty or costs of the investigation if a civil penalty or costs were sought in the statement accompanying the order, becomes final as to that person by operation of law. If a hearing is requested or ordered, the director, after notice of and opportunity for hearing to each person subject to the order, may modify or vacate the order or extend it until final determination. (c) Procedure for final order. If a hearing is requested or ordered pursuant to subsection (b), a hearing must be held pursuant to chapter 1-26. A final order may not be issued unless the director makes findings of fact and conclusions of law in a record pursuant to chapter 1-26. The final order may make final, vacate, or modify the order issued under subsection (a). (d) Civil penalty. In a final order under subsection (c), the director may impose a civil penalty up to ten thousand dollars for each violation. (e) Costs. In a final order, the director may charge the actual cost of an investigation or proceeding for a violation of this Act or a rule adopted or order issued under this Act. (f) Filing of certified final order with court; effect of filing. If a petition for judicial review of a final order is not filed in accordance with Section 609, the director may file a certified copy of the final order with the clerk of a court of competent jurisdiction. The order so filed has the same effect as a judgment of the court and may be recorded, enforced, or satisfied in the same manner as a judgment of the court. (g) Enforcement by court; further civil penalty. If a person does not comply with an order under this section, the director may petition a court of competent jurisdiction to enforce the order. The court may not require the director to post a bond in an action or proceeding under this section. If the court finds, after service and opportunity for hearing, that the person was not in compliance with the order, the court may adjudge the person in civil contempt of the order. The court may impose a further civil penalty against the person for contempt in an amount not more than ten thousand dollars, for each violation and may grant any other relief the court determines is just and proper in the circumstances. Section 43. Section 605. (a) Issuance and adoption of forms, orders, and rules. The director may: (1) Issue forms and orders and, after notice and comment, may adopt and amend rules necessary or appropriate to carry out this Act and may repeal rules, including rules and forms governing registration statements, applications, notice filings, reports, and other records; (2) By rule, define terms, whether or not used in this Act, but those definitions may not be inconsistent with this Act; and (3) By rule, classify securities, persons, and transactions and adopt different requirements for different classes. (b) Findings and cooperation. Under this Act, a rule or form may not be adopted or amended, or an order issued or amended, unless the director finds that the rule, form, order, or amendment is necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors and is consistent with the purposes intended by this Act. In adopting, amending, and repealing rules and forms, Section 608 applies in order to achieve uniformity among the states and coordination with federal laws in the form and content of registration statements, applications, reports, and other records, including the adoption of uniform rules, forms, and procedures. (c) Financial statements. Subject to Section 15(h) of the Securities Exchange Act and Section 222 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, the director may require that a financial statement filed under this Act be prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States and comply with other requirements specified by rule adopted or order issued under this Act. A rule adopted or order issued under this Act may establish: (1) Subject to Section 15(h) of the Securities Exchange Act and Section 222 of the Investment Advisors Act of 1940, the form and content of financial statements required under this Act; (2) Whether unconsolidated financial statements must be filed; and (3) Whether required financial statements must be audited by an independent certified public accountant. (d) Interpretative opinions. The director may provide interpretative opinions or issue determinations that the director will not institute a proceeding or an action under this Act against a specified person for engaging in a specified act, practice, or course of business if the determination is consistent with this Act. A fifty dollar fee is required for interpretative opinions and no action letters. (e) Effect of compliance. A penalty under this Act may not be imposed for, and liability does not arise from conduct that is engaged in or omitted in good faith believing it conforms to a rule, form, or order of the director under this Act. (f) Presumption for public hearings. A hearing in an administrative proceeding under this Act must be conducted in public unless the director for good cause consistent with this Act determines that the hearing will not be so conducted.

The director shall furnish a copy of a record that is a public record or a certification that the public record does not exist to a person that so requests. A rule adopted under this Act may establish a reasonable charge for furnishing the record or certification. A copy of the record certified or a certificate by the director of a record's nonexistence is prima facie evidence of a record or its nonexistence. Section 45. Section 607. (a) Presumption of public records. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b), records obtained by the director or filed under this Act, including a record contained in or filed with a registration statement, application, notice filing, or report, are public records and are available for public examination.
