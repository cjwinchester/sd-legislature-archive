Before June 1, 2019, the advisory committee shall set language developmental milestones for inclusion in the parent resource created pursuant to section 2 of this Act. Section 6. That chapter 13-33B be amended by adding a NEW SECTION to read: The superintendent of the State School for the Deaf shall establish an advisory committee for purposes of soliciting input from experts on the selection of language developmental milestones for children who are deaf or hard-of-hearing that are equivalent to experts for children who are not deaf or hard-of-hearing, for inclusion in the parent resource pursuant to sections 2 and 4 of this Act.
