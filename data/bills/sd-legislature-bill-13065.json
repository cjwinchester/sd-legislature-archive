Each forty-five minute increment of time that school is in session during a day beyond the five and one-half hour school day as defined in \u00a7 13-26-1 constitutes one-eighth of a make- up day. Once a school district has completed the equivalent of ten weather-related make-up days, regardless of whether the make-up days were held separately or as the result of time accumulated through the extension of school days as provided in this Act, the school district may no longer use extended school days for make-up purposes. Section 2. Whereas, this Act is necessary for the support of the state government and its existing public institutions, an emergency is hereby declared to exist, and this Act shall be in full force and effect from and after its passage and approval.
