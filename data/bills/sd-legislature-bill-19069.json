The foregoing limitation does not apply to premiums payable directly or indirectly by the United States government or by any of its instrumentalities; (6) Installment premiums other than life insurance premiums to the extent of the unearned premium reserve carried on the policy to which premiums apply; (7) Notes and like written obligations not past due, taken for premiums other than life insurance premiums, on policies permitted to be issued on such basis, to the extent of the unearned premium reserves carried thereon; (8) The full amount of reinsurance recoverable by a ceding insurer from a solvent reinsurer and which reinsurance is authorized under this title; (9) Amounts receivable by an assuming insurer representing funds withheld by a solvent ceding insurer under a reinsurance treaty; (10) Deposits or equities recoverable from underwriting associations, syndicates, and reinsurance funds, or from any suspended banking institution, to the extent deemed by the director available for the payment of losses and claims and at values to be determined by the director; (11) Data and word processing machines used in the insurer's business. However, the original cost of the system shall be at least one thousand dollars but may not be more than three percent of the admitted assets of the insurer. Such cost shall be amortized over a period not to exceed five years; (12) All assets, whether or not consistent with the provisions of this section, as may be allowed pursuant to the annual statement form approved by the director for the kinds of insurance to be reported upon therein; (13) Goodwill arising from acquisitions and mergers occurring after January 1, 2001; (14) Other assets, not inconsistent with the provisions of this section, deemed by the director to be available for the payment of losses and claims at values to be determined by the director.

In addition to assets impliedly excluded by other provisions of this title, the following expressly may not be allowed as assets in any determination of the financial condition of an insurer: (1) Goodwill, except goodwill permitted by \u00a7 58-26-1, trade names, and other like intangible assets; (2) Advances to officers, other than policy loans, whether secured or not, and advances to employees, representatives, insurance producers, and other persons on personal security only; (3) Stock of such insurer, owned by it, or any material equity therein or loans secured thereby, or any material proportionate interest in such stock acquired or held through the ownership by such insurer of an interest in another firm, corporation, or business unit; (4) Furniture, fixtures, furnishings, safes, vehicles, libraries, stationery, literature, and supplies, except in the case of title insurers such materials and plants as the insurer is expressly authorized to invest in under this title and except, in the case of any insurer, such personal property as the insurer is permitted to hold pursuant to this title, or which is acquired through foreclosure of chattel mortgages or which is reasonably necessary for the maintenance and operation of real estate lawfully acquired and held by the insurer other than real estate used by it for home office, branch office, and similar purposes; (5) The amount, if any, by which the aggregate book value of investments as carried in the ledger assets of the insurer exceeds the aggregate value thereof as determined under this title."},
