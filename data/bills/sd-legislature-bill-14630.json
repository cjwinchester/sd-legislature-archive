BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 32-23-11.1 be amended to read as follows: 32-23-11.1. A person's license to drive is not subject to revocation as provided in \u00a7 32-23-11 or 32-23-18 if that person pleads guilty to violating \u00a7 32-23-1, or if the charge of violating \u00a7 32-23-1 is dismissed by the state prior to the departmental hearing and the person is not convicted of a violation of \u00a7 32-24-1 or 32-24-8, or, if a hearing is not requested, prior to a revocation order being issued. If such person's license to drive is revoked, if that person has never been convicted or plead guilty to a violation of \u00a7 32-23-1, and if the state subsequently dismisses the charge of violating \u00a7 32-23-1, the department shall reinstate the license to drive upon request by the person whose license was thus revoked. Section 2. That \u00a7 32-23-18 be amended to read as follows: 32-23-18.
