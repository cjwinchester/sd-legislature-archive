It's about how they encouraged a program based on character, hard work, faith, and excellence in all areas\"; and WHEREAS, Coach Stig and Laurie are to this day the most humble, thoughtful souls you should be so lucky to meet: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT COMMEMORATED, by the Ninety-Ninth Legislature of the State of South Dakota, that John and Laurie Stiegelmeier be honored and celebrated as outstanding South Dakotans who have made a lasting impact on the state and their SDSU family."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": []}
