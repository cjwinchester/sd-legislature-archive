Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of South Dakota: Section 1. That a NEW SECTION be added: 7-34-1. Petition--Recall--County commissioner. A county commissioner may be removed from office at any time by the voters as provided in this Act. A petition demanding the election of a successor for a county commissioner sought to be removed must be signed by: (1) Fifteen percent of the registered voters of the district that the commissioner represents; or (2) Five percent of the registered voters of the county if the commissioner serves the entire county. The percentage and number of signatures required under this section shall be based upon the total number of registered voters at the last preceding general election. The allowable grounds for removal are misconduct, malfeasance, nonfeasance, crimes in office, drunkenness, gross incompetency, corruption, theft, oppression, or gross partiality. The petition shall contain a specific statement of the grounds on which removal is sought. The form for the county recall petition shall be prescribed by the state Board of Elections pursuant to chapter 1-26. No signature on a petition is valid if signed more than sixty days before the filing of the petitions. If a petition to recall is filed with the county auditor and meets the above requirements, the county auditor shall present the petition to the county commission at its next meeting, except in the case of a petition to recall a county auditor, which shall be given to the county treasurer to present to the county commission and to be filed with the county. Only the petition signatures may be challenged in the manner established in \u00a7\u00a7 12-1-13 through 12-1-16. A failure to challenge petition signatures pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 12-1-13 through 12-1-16, does not prohibit an interested person from challenging the filing of the recall petition or the sufficiency of the specific statement of the grounds of the recall petition. A challenge to the recall petition regarding the specific statement of the grounds of the recall petition must be filed in circuit court within five business days of the filing of the recall petition. The circuit court shall conduct an expedited declaratory judgment hearing with no right to trial by jury. Section 2. That a NEW SECTION be added: 7-34-2. Special election--Recall--County commissioner. A special election shall be held within sixty days after the filing of a petition under \u00a7 7-34-1. However, if the petition is filed within ninety days prior to a primary, general, or statewide special election, the question of a successor shall be submitted at that primary, general, or statewide special election. Any commissioner sought to be removed may be a candidate and, unless the incumbent requests otherwise in writing, the auditor shall place the incumbent's name on the official ballot without nomination. The auditor shall also place on the official ballot the name of any other candidate nominated as provided in this Act. If no other candidate is nominated for the position, no recall election may be held, and the incumbent shall remain in office. Section 3. That a NEW SECTION be added: 7-34-3. Qualification--Special election--Term. For an election under \u00a7 7-34-2, if the incumbent is elected, the incumbent shall continue in office. If some person other than the incumbent is elected, the incumbent is deemed removed from office upon or at the expiration of the time for qualification of the successor. The successor shall qualify within ten days after receiving notification of election, and in case of a failure to qualify, the office shall be deemed vacant. The qualified successor of any removed commissioner shall hold office during the remainder of the predecessor's unexpired term."}], "amendments": [{"bill_id": 21806, "document_id": 211545, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/211545.pdf", "legislator_profile_id": 1830, "document_id_instructions": 211673, "document_id_instructions_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/211673.pdf"}], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 21806, "action_date": "2021-01-14T13:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 211177, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/211177.pdf", "status_text": "First Reading House", "journal_page": 28, "committee_id_action": 492, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 21806, "action_date": "2021-01-15T12:30:00-06:00", "document_id": 211322, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/211322.pdf", "status_text": "Referred to", "journal_page": 34, "committee_id_action": 492, "committee_id_assigned": 495, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 21806, "action_date": "2021-01-21T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 211767, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/211767.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 495, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 21806, "action_date": "2021-01-21T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 211769, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/211769.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to another day", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 495, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 21806, "action_date": "2021-01-26T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 212438, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/212438.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 495, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 21806, "action_date": "2021-01-26T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 212443, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/212443.pdf", "status_text": "Motion to amend", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 495, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 21806, "action_date": "2021-01-26T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 212443, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/212443.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass Amended", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 495, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "D", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 21806, "action_date": "2021-01-26T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 212443, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/212443.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to the 41st legislative day", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 495, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 67862, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [1768, 3792, 1795, 3797, 1807, 3788, 1843, 3787, 3789, 3801], "Nay": [1780, 1829, 1868]}}]}
