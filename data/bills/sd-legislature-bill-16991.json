For the purpose of broadening the diversity of its dealer body and enhancing opportunities for qualified persons who are part of a group who have historically been underrepresented in its dealer body, or other qualified persons who lack the resources to purchase a dealership outright, or at the request or concurrence of a licensed franchise dealer for the purpose of revitalizing an underperforming market area, but for no other purpose, a manufacturer or franchisor may temporarily own an interest in a dealership if the manufacturer's or franchisor's participation in the dealership is in a bona fide relationship with a franchised vehicle dealer who: (1) Has made a significant investment in the dealership, subject to loss; (2) Has an ownership interest in the dealership; and (3) Operates the dealership under a plan to acquire full ownership of the dealership within a reasonable time and under reasonable terms and conditions. In addition, if an independent franchised dealer selling any line-make of new motor vehicles sold by the manufacturer or franchisor is located in the relevant market area of a dealership in which the manufacturer or franchisor proposes to enter into a business relationship meeting the requirements of this section, the dealer shall be entitled, upon request, to be considered for selection in such relationship, before the manufacturer or franchisor considers other candidates. For the purposes of this section, an underperforming market area means an area where the manufacturer's or franchisor's market share has substantially declined or has remained below its state average market share in that line-make for the preceding three years.

Such expenses and attorney fees shall be paid to the proposed new owner or transferee at the time of closing of the sale or transfer for which the manufacturer or franchisor exercised its right of first refusal. No payment of such expenses and attorney fees is required if the new owner or transferee has not submitted an accounting of those expenses within thirty days of the dealer's receipt of the manufacturer's or franchisors written request for such an accounting. A manufacturer or franchisor may request such accounting before exercising a right of first refusal; and (5) The dealer does not have any liability to any person as to any disclosed term, condition, or issue as a result of a manufacturer or franchisor exercising a right of first refusal. Section 6. That chapter 32-6B be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: A franchisor may reasonably and periodically audit a franchisee to determine the validity of paid claims or chargebacks for customer or dealer incentives.
