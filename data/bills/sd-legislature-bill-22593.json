Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of South Dakota: Section 1. That \u00a7 2-12-1 be AMENDED: 2-12-1. Any person who employs any other person to act as a lobbyist to seek the introduction of legislation or to promote, oppose, or influence in any manner the passage by the Legislature of any legislation affecting the special interests of any agency, individual, association, or business, as distinct from those of the whole people of the state, or to act in any manner as a lobbyist in connection with any such legislation, shall register the name of the person so employed or agreed to be employed, with the secretary of state, to be included in a directory of registered lobbyists as hereinafter provided. The lobbyist shall also register with the secretary of state. Upon the termination of such employment prior to the adjournment sine die of a legislative session, such fact shall be entered opposite the name of any person so employed, either by the employer or employee. Section 2. That \u00a7 2-12-5 be AMENDED: 2-12-5. Any person employing any lobbyist shall, whenever further subjects of legislation are introduced or arise which such lobbyist is hired to promote or oppose, make or cause to be made additional entries opposite his name in the directory, stating such additional employment in such manner that such entries shall show all the subjects of legislation in relation to which any lobbyist is employed. No person, agency, business organization, or association may, directly or indirectly, employ any person as lobbyist in respect to any legislation coming within the terms of this chapter, unless the name of such person is duly entered on the lobbyist directory as provided by this chapter. Section 3. That \u00a7 2-12-8.2 be AMENDED: 2-12-8.2. No elected officer, department or agency head, or division director, or the highest paid employee reporting to such person may be compensated, act, or register as a lobbyist, other than a public employee lobbyist, during a period of two years after that person's termination of service in the state government. A violation of this section is a Class 1 misdemeanor. Section 4. That chapter 2-12 be amended with a NEW SECTION: No state official or employee, acting in his or her official capacity, may lobby for or against any matter that is intended to have the force and effect of law, and is pending before the legislature or any committee of the legislature. Nothing in this section prohibits a state official or employee from disseminating objective, factual information relative to any such matter. No state official or employee may, on behalf of his or her agency, contract with a person for the provision of lobbying services in regard to any matter that is intended to have the force and effect of law, and is pending before the legislature or any committee of the legislature. For purposes of this section, the term, state official, means: (1) A person who holds a statewide office, as defined in \u00a7 12-27-1, including any person who has been elected or appointed, but who has not yet assumed office; and (2) Any person who heads an executive branch agency, a judicial branch agency, or any state board or commission, including any person who has been appointed, but who has not yet assumed office. Section 5. That \u00a7 2-12-7.1 be REPEALED: Any person employed in the executive branch of state government, a constitutional office, or the judicial system, who is not an elected official or who is not subject to confirmation by the senate, who is authorized to officially represent any department of the executive branch, constitutional office, Public Utilities Commission, or judicial system in any capacity before the Legislature or any of its several committees shall register as an executive or judicial agency representative for such department or office in the same manner and under the same provisions of this chapter as apply to all lobbyists, but need pay no fee. Every executive and judicial agency representative shall wear a badge which shall be visible at all times when engaged in representing the department. The badge shall be provided by the secretary of state and be of a color different from the color of lobbyist badges. The badge shall bear the identity of the agency the person has registered to represent and shall state the name of the person. The provisions of this chapter do not apply to employees of the executive branch testifying on budgetary matters before the appropriations committees of the Legislature."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 22593, "action_date": "2022-02-02T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 231905, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/231905.pdf", "status_text": "First Reading House", "journal_page": 178, "committee_id_action": 1008, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 22593, "action_date": "2022-02-04T13:30:00-06:00", "document_id": 232452, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/232452.pdf", "status_text": "Referred to", "journal_page": 211, "committee_id_action": 1008, "committee_id_assigned": 1016, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 22593, "action_date": "2022-02-14T07:30:00-06:00", "document_id": 233267, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/233267.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 1016, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 22593, "action_date": "2022-02-14T07:30:00-06:00", "document_id": 233272, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/233272.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 1016, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "F", "vote": {"vote_id": 73607, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [3912, 3923, 3941, 3965, 3989, 3995, 3957, 3982], "Yea": [3916, 3942, 3946, 3954, 4011]}}, {"bill_id": 22593, "action_date": "2022-02-14T07:30:00-06:00", "document_id": 233272, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/233272.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to the 41st legislative day", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 1016, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 73608, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [3912, 3923, 3941, 3965, 3989, 3995, 3957, 3982], "Nay": [3916, 3942, 3946, 3954, 4011]}}]}
