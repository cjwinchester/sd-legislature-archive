BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. There is hereby created the South Dakota Commission on Higher Pay. The commission is charged with the assignment to study all relevant components of the state's economic environment in an attempt to determine why the state's wage structure presently lags behind national and regional averages. In doing so, the commission shall consider such factors as industrial diversification, the impact of economic development, the predominance of agriculture and tourism, infrastructure problems including failure to be part of the national rail and air network, unemployment and underemployment, geographical concerns, housing, the depopulation of the farming communities, the concentration of new growth along the interstate highway system, the inability of small town financial institutions to provide investment capital, the unique employment problems of the reservations, out-migration of college graduates, vocational training, population demographics, the role of state govenment in economic development, and any other considerations that the commission may identify and deem significant. Upon completion of its charge, or from time to time as it deems appropriate, the commission shall report its findings and conclusions and shall recommend corrective legislation to the Legislature. Section 2. The commission shall be composed of thirteen members each appointed for the life of the commission by the Executive Board of the Legislative Research Council. Two members of the commission shall be legislators, one from each political party. At least one member on the commission shall represent labor, industry, small business, the retail and service trades, agriculture, and the Lakota nation. Some members should have a familiarity with economics, demographics, transportation systems, infrastructure, and education. No more than eight members of the commission may be of the same political party. Any vacancy on the commission shall be filled by an appropriate appointment by the Executive Board of the Legislative Research Council. Section 3. The initial chair shall be appointed by the Executive Board for a one-year term. Thereafter the commission shall select its own chair. Section 4. The commission shall meet a minimum of eight times per year. At least six meetings per year shall be scheduled outside of the state capital including rural areas and reservations to facilitate a broad spectrum of public testimony and to provide the commission with an opportunity to view a maximum of varied economic environments on site. Section 5. The commission shall report to the Executive Board from time to time as it deems appropriate but not less than annually. The commission may report findings and conclusions or recommend legislation at any time. If the commission finds it desirable to contract for consulting services, it shall submit a timely budget request to the Executive Board. Section 6. The members of the commission shall receive per diem and expenses as provided by statute. Section 7. The commission terminates on June 30, 2000. Section 8. There is hereby appropriated from the general fund the sum of twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000), or so much thereof as may be necessary, to the Legislative Research Council to provide for per diem and expenses for the Commission on Higher Pay. Section 9. Expenditures authorized by this Act shall be paid on warrants drawn by the state auditor on vouchers approved by the director of the Legislative Research Council. Section 10. Any funds not lawfully expended or obligated by June 30, 2000, shall revert to the general fund in accordance with \u00a7 4-8-21."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 13010, "action_date": "1997-01-29T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 72888, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/72888.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 199, "committee_id_action": 544, "committee_id_assigned": 539, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 13010, "action_date": "1997-02-12T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 72343, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/72343.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 539, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 13010, "action_date": "1997-02-12T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 72343, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/72343.pdf", "status_text": "Referred to", "journal_page": 436, "committee_id_action": 539, "committee_id_assigned": 531, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 37153, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [1890, 1900, 1904, 1961, 1921], "Yea": [1924, 1931, 1967, 1926, 1940, 1949, 1970], "Excused": [1936]}}, {"bill_id": 13010, "action_date": "1997-02-12T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 72908, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/72908.pdf", "status_text": "Re-referred to", "journal_page": 441, "committee_id_action": 544, "committee_id_assigned": 531, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 13010, "action_date": "1997-02-15T08:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 72376, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/72376.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to another day", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 531, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 13010, "action_date": "1997-02-18T08:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 72388, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/72388.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 531, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 13010, "action_date": "1997-02-18T08:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 72388, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/72388.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to 41st legislative day", "journal_page": 527, "committee_id_action": 531, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 36627, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [1896, 1913, 1974], "Excused": [1906, 1952], "Yea": [1933, 1944, 1957, 1966, 1964]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/13010"}
