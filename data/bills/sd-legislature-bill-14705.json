Repair or replacement of damaged hearing aids, dentures, prescription eyeglasses, eyeglass frames , or contact lenses is considered a medical service under this section if the hearing aids, dentures, prescription eyeglasses, eyeglass frames , or contact lenses were damaged or destroyed in an accident which also causes another injury which is compensable under this law. The employee shall have the initial selection to secure his the employee's own physician, surgeon, or hospital services at the employer's expense. If the employee selects a health care provider located in a community not the home or workplace of the employee, and a health care provider is available to provide the services needed by the employee in the local community or in a closer community, no travel expenses need be paid by the employer or the employer's insurer. If an injured employee has not required medical treatment for a period of three years, it is presumed that no further medical care with respect to the injury is necessary.

However, the claimant may present other medical proof to rebut the presumption. Section 7. That \u00a7 62-4-5 be amended to read as follows: 62-4-5. If, after an injury has been sustained, the employee as a result thereof becomes partially incapacitated from pursuing the employee's usual and customary line of employment, or if the employee has been released by the employee's physician from temporary total disability and has not been given a rating to which \u00a7 62-4-6 would apply, the employee shall receive compensation, subject to the limitations as to maximum amounts fixed in \u00a7 62-4-3, equal to one-half of the difference between the average amount which the employee earned before the accident, and the average amount which the employee is earning or is able to earn in some suitable employment or business after the accident. If the employee has not received a bona fide job offer that the employee is physically capable of performing, compensation shall be at the rate provided by \u00a7 62-4-3.

(2) \"Sporadic employment resulting in an insubstantial income,\" employment that does not offer an employee the opportunity to work either full-time or part-time and pay wages equivalent to, or greater than, the workers' compensation benefit rate applicable to the employee at the time of the employee's injury.

An employee has the burden of proof to make a prima facie showing of permanent total disability. The burden then shifts to the employer to show that some form of suitable work is regularly and continuously available to the claimant employee in the community. The employer may meet this burden by showing that a position is available that has essential functions the employee can perform with or without reasonable accommodations. An employee shall introduce evidence of a reasonable, good faith work search effort unless the medical or vocational findings show such efforts would be futile. The effort to seek employment is not reasonable if the employee places undue limitations on the kind of work the employee will accept or purposefully leaves the labor market. An employee shall introduce expert opinion evidence that the employee is unable to benefit from vocational rehabilitation or that the same is not feasible. If an employee chooses to move to an area to obtain suitable employment that is not available within the employee's community, the employer shall pay moving expenses of household goods not to exceed four weeks of compensation at the rate provided by \u00a7 62-4-3.

The council shall meet as frequently as necessary but not less than twice each year. The council shall make reports of its meetings that shall include a record of its discussions , including all issues voted upon and the vote count, and its recommendations.

Section 4. That \u00a7 62-4-1 be amended to read as follows: 62-4-1. The employer shall provide necessary first aid, medical, surgical, and hospital services, or other suitable and proper care including medical and surgical supplies, apparatus, artificial members , and body aids during the disability or treatment of an employee within the provisions of this title. Repair or replacement of damaged prosthetic devices is compensable and is considered a medical service under this section if the devices were damaged or destroyed in a work related accident. Repair or replacement of damaged hearing aids, dentures, prescription eyeglasses, eyeglass frames , or contact lenses is considered a medical service under this section if the hearing aids, dentures, prescription eyeglasses, eyeglass frames , or contact lenses were damaged or destroyed in an accident which also causes another injury which is compensable under this law. The employee shall have the initial selection to secure his the employee's own physician, surgeon, or hospital services at the employer's expense. If the employee selects a health care provider located in a community not the home or workplace of the employee, and a health care provider is available to provide the services needed by the employee in the local community or in a closer community, no travel expenses need be paid by the employer or the employer's insurer. If an injured employee has not required medical treatment for a period of three years, it is presumed that no further medical care with respect to the injury is necessary. Documentation that the injury is work related by the primary treating or rating physician after three years shall automatically rebut the presumption. However, the claimant may present other medical proof to rebut the presumption. Section 5. That \u00a7 62-4-5 be amended to read as follows: 62-4-5. If, after an injury has been sustained, the employee as a result thereof becomes partially incapacitated from pursuing the employee's usual and customary line of employment, or if the employee has been released by the employee's physician from temporary total disability and has not been given a rating to which \u00a7 62-4-6 would apply, the employee shall receive compensation, subject to the limitations as to maximum amounts fixed in \u00a7 62-4-3, equal to one-half of the difference between the average amount which the employee earned before the accident, and the average amount which the employee is earning or is able to earn in some suitable employment or business after the accident. If the employee has not received a bona fide job offer that the employee is physically capable of performing, compensation shall be at the rate provided by \u00a7 62-4-3. However, in no event may the total calculation be less than the amount the claimant was receiving for temporary total disability, unless the claimant refuses suitable employment with the employer . Section 6. That \u00a7 62-4-52 be amended to read as follows: 62-4-52. Terms used in \u00a7 62-4-53 mean: (1) \"Community,\" the area within sixty road miles of the employee's residence unless: (a) The employee is physically limited to travel within a lesser distance; (b) Consideration of the wages available within sixty road miles and the cost of commuting to the job site makes it financially infeasible to work within such a distance; (c) An employee has expanded the employee's community by regularly being employed at a distance greater than sixty road miles of the employee's residence, in which case community shall be defined as that distance previously traveled. (2) \"Sporadic employment resulting in an insubstantial income,\" employment that does not offer an employee the opportunity to work either full-time or part-time and pay wages equivalent to, or greater than, the workers' compensation benefit rate applicable to the employee at the time of the employee's injury. Commission or piece-work pay may or may not be considered sporadic employment depending upon the facts of the individual situation. If a bona fide position is available that has essential functions that the injured employee can perform, with or without reasonable accommodations, and offers the employee the opportunity to work either full-time or part-time and pays wages equivalent to, or greater than, the workers' compensation benefit rate applicable to the employee at the time of the employee's injury the employment is not sporadic. The department shall retain jurisdiction over disputes arising under this provision to ensure that any such position is suitable when compared to the employee's former job and that such employment is regularly and continuously available to the employee. Section 7. That \u00a7 62-4-53 be amended to read as follows: 62-4-53. An employee is permanently totally disabled if the employee's physical condition, in combination with the employee's age, training, and experience and the type of work available in the employee's community, cause the employee to be unable to secure anything more than sporadic employment resulting in an insubstantial income. An employee has the burden of proof to make a prima facie showing of permanent total disability. The burden then shifts to the employer to show that some form of suitable work is regularly and continuously available to the claimant employee in the community. The employer may meet this burden by showing that a position is available which is not sporadic employment resulting in an insubstantial income as defined in subdivision 62-4-52(2). An employee shall introduce evidence of a reasonable, good faith work search effort unless the medical or vocational findings show such efforts would be futile. The effort to seek employment is not reasonable if the employee places undue limitations on the kind of work the employee will accept or purposefully leaves the labor market. An employee shall introduce expert opinion evidence that the employee is unable to benefit from vocational rehabilitation or that the same is not feasible. If an employee chooses to move to an area to obtain suitable employment that is not available within the employee's community, the employer shall pay moving expenses of household goods not to exceed four weeks of compensation at the rate provided by \u00a7 62-4-3. Section 8. That \u00a7 62-6-1 be amended to read as follows: 62-6-1. Every employer coming under the provisions of this title shall keep a record of all injuries, fatal or otherwise, sustained by his the employer's employees in the course of their employment. The record shall be completed within ten seven calendar days, not counting Sundays and legal holidays, after any employer has knowledge of the occurrence of an injury. The record shall be on a form approved by the Department of Labor. The employer shall preserve the record for a period of at least four years from the date of injury. The record shall be signed by the employer and a copy given to the injured employee. Any employer who fails to complete or maintain the injury records required by this section is guilty of a Class 2 misdemeanor. Section 9. That \u00a7 62-6-2 be amended to read as follows: 62-6-2. An employer covered by the provisions of this title who has knowledge of an injury that requires medical treatment other than minor first aid or that incapacitates the employee for seven or more calendar days shall file a written report with: (1) The Department of Labor when the employer is self-insured under \u00a7 62-5-4; or (2) The employer's insurer when the employer has insured the liability under \u00a7 62-5-2 or 62-5-3. The report shall be filed within ten seven calendar days , not counting Sundays and legal holidays, after the employer has knowledge of the injury, unless the employer had good cause for failing to file the written report within the ten-day seven-day period. If the tenth day is a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the report may be filed on the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or a legal holiday. The report shall be made on a form approved by the Department of Labor. Any employer who fails to file a report as required by this section is guilty of a Class 2 misdemeanor and is subject to an administrative fine of one hundred dollars payable to the Department of Labor. Section 10. That \u00a7 62-7-13 be amended to read as follows: 62-7-13. The department may make such inquiries and investigations it deems necessary. The hearings of the department shall be in the municipality or place where the injury occurred. However, if the injury occurred in a remote place the hearing may be held at some other a place which the department determines to be more convenient to the parties and to the witnesses. A record of the proceedings at the hearing shall be kept, the expense of the record to be borne by the department. The department shall file its decision, its findings of fact , and conclusions of law and shall serve the same on the parties forthwith by dispatching a copy addressed to each party or his the party's attorney by mail, postage paid. Section 11. That \u00a7 62-7-35.1 be amended to read as follows: 62-7-35.1. In any case in which any benefits have been tendered pursuant to this title on account of an injury, any claim for additional compensation shall be barred, unless a claim is filed within three years from the date of the last payment of benefits. However, the time limitation of this section does not apply to claims for medical care or the replacement of medicine, crutches, ambulatory devices, artificial limbs, eyeglasses, contact lenses, hearing aids, and other apparatus, which medical care or apparatus are permanently or indefinitely required as the result of a compensable injury. The provision of such medical care or replacement of such items does not constitute payment of compensation so as to toll the running of the statute of limitations. The provisions this section do not apply to review and revision of payments or other benefits under \u00a7 62-7-33. Section 12. That chapter 62-7 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: The right to compensation under this title is forever barred if no medical treatment has been obtained within seven years after the employee files the first report of injury.
