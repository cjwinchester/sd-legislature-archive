Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of South Dakota: Section 1. That chapter 58-30 be amended with a NEW SECTION: If the director has reasonable evidence that a licensed insurance producer has violated any provision of this title and the licensed producer has also violated subdivision 58-33-66(1) for failing to respond to division inquiries regarding the same, the director may, after sufficient notice, revoke the producer's license by an order of the director without a hearing. An order under this section must include the applicable provisions of \u00a7 58-4-16 and chapter 1-26 for final agency decisions and must be accompanied by exhibits demonstrating the alleged violations. For purposes of this section, the term \"sufficient notice\" means: (1) The producer is provided notice of the alleged violations at the producer's last reported mailing address on file with the director; and (2) The producer is provided a second notice at the producer's last reported mailing address on file with the director stating the producer is in violation of \u00a7 58-33-66 and must respond to avoid administrative action by the division. Section 2. That chapter 58-30 be amended with a NEW SECTION: An order under section 1 of this Act must allow sixty days for the producer to request a hearing in writing. If a timely request for hearing is received, the director shall issue a notice of hearing within thirty days. The office of hearing examiners shall hold the hearing, review the director's order with the evidence presented at hearing, and issue a proposed decision. If a producer does not timely request a hearing, the director's order revoking the license becomes the final agency decision pursuant to \u00a7 1-26-25."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 24739, "action_date": "2024-01-09T12:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 257007, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/257007.pdf", "status_text": "First read in Senate and referred to", "journal_page": 17, "committee_id_action": 1219, "committee_id_assigned": 1209, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 24739, "action_date": "2024-01-11T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 258825, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/258825.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 1209, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 24739, "action_date": "2024-01-11T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 258827, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/258827.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 1209, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 78362, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [4487, 4507, 4512, 4517, 4536, 4558, 4564, 4477, 4572]}}, {"bill_id": 24739, "action_date": "2024-01-11T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 258827, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/258827.pdf", "status_text": "Certified uncontested, placed on consent", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 1209, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 24739, "action_date": "2024-01-12T13:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 259398, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/259398.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass", "journal_page": 76, "committee_id_action": 1219, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 78429, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [4477, 4480, 4481, 4487, 4488, 4490, 4493, 4498, 4502, 4507, 4508, 4512, 4515, 4516, 4517, 4523, 4526, 4529, 4536, 4541, 4550, 4554, 4558, 4559, 4564, 4567, 4572, 4573, 4574], "Excused": [4479, 4501, 4537, 4547, 4576]}}, {"bill_id": 24739, "action_date": "2024-01-16T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 259641, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/259641.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 60, "committee_id_action": 1197, "committee_id_assigned": 1192, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 24739, "action_date": "2024-01-24T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 261284, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/261284.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 1192, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 24739, "action_date": "2024-01-24T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 261285, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/261285.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 1192, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 78803, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [4472, 4475, 4482, 4494, 4497, 4519, 4535, 4546, 4557, 4560, 4543, 4571], "Nay": [4533]}}, {"bill_id": 24739, "action_date": "2024-01-25T13:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 262421, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/262421.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to another day", "journal_page": 180, "committee_id_action": 1197, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {}}]}
