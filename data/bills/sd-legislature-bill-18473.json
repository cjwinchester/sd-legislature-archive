Section 2. The aircraft jurisdiction of South Dakota includes any of the following aircraft in flight: (1) Any civil aircraft in South Dakota; (2) Any civil aircraft outside of South Dakota that has its next scheduled destination or last place of departure in South Dakota, if the aircraft next lands in South Dakota; (3) Any civil aircraft outside of South Dakota on which any person commits an offense, which if committed in the state would constitute a crime, if the aircraft lands in South Dakota with the person who committed the offense still on the aircraft; (4) Any civil aircraft outside of South Dakota against which any person commits an offense, as defined in subsection (d) or (e) of article I, section I of the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Civil Aviation, if the aircraft lands in South Dakota with the person who committed the offense still on the aircraft; or (5) Any other civil aircraft leased without a crew to a lessee whose principal place of business is in South Dakota or, if the lessee does not have a principal place of business, whose permanent residence is in South Dakota."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 18473, "action_date": "2004-01-21T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 99482, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/99482.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 126, "committee_id_action": 831, "committee_id_assigned": 829, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 18473, "action_date": "2004-02-04T07:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 100603, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/100603.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 829, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 18473, "action_date": "2004-02-04T07:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 100603, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/100603.pdf", "status_text": "Tabled", "journal_page": 385, "committee_id_action": 829, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 59152, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [3057, 3060, 3070, 3075, 3080, 3084, 3106, 3114, 3119, 3125, 3133, 3107], "Excused": [3111]}}]}
