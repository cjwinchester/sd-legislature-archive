Each nondriver identification card is renewable one hundred eighty days before its expiration upon application and payment of the required fee. The fee for the renewal of a nondriver identification card is the same as prescribed for a driver license in \u00a7 32-12-16. Any nondriver identification card renewed before its expiration expires five years after the holder's ensuing birthday, or on the date of expiration of the applicant's authorized stay in the United States as determined by the systematic alien verification for entitlements system or alternate method approved by the United States Department of Homeland Security or, if there is no expiration date, for a period no longer than one year from date of issuance, whichever occurs first.
