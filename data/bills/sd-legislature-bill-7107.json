The chemical analysis shall be administered at the direction of a law enforcement officer who, after stopping or detaining the commercial motor vehicle driver any person who holds or is required to hold a commercial learner's permit or commercial driver license, has probable cause to believe that the driver person was driving or in actual physical control of a commercial or noncommercial motor vehicle while having any alcohol or drugs in that person's system. Any person requested by a law enforcement officer under this section to submit to a chemical analysis shall be advised by the officer that: (1) If the person refuses to submit to the chemical analysis, none shall be given; and (2) If the person refuses to submit to the chemical analysis requested, the person shall be immediately: (a) Immediately placed out of service for a period of twenty-four hours, if operating a commercial motor vehicle at the time of the refusal; and be disqualified (b) Disqualified from operating a commercial motor vehicle for a period of not less than one year; or (3) If the person submits to a chemical analysis which discloses that the person was operating the commercial motor vehicle while there was 0.04 percent or more by weight of alcohol in that person's blood the person shall be disqualified from operating a commercial motor vehicle for not less than one year. Section 2. That \u00a7 32-12A-36 be amended to read: 32-12A-36.
