WHEREAS, Americans enjoy the safest and most abundant food supply in the world, which reflects the tremendous productivity and efficiency of our agricultural economy; and WHEREAS, it is critically important to the people of the United States to maintain the safety and reliability of our food supply and to protect our food supply from contamination from whatever source; and WHEREAS, the dramatic increase in the incidence of Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy in Europe has prompted the World Health Organization to declare its \"exposure worldwide\" thus critically threatening the safety of our food supply. This outbreak of \"mad cow disease\" introduces a frightening and lethal condition that could spread to many parts of the world if proper measures are not taken to contain it; and WHEREAS, in recent years the world's food supply has faced additional threats in the form of foot and mouth disease and the presence of food-borne illnesses and illness-causing organisms, such as salmonella, E. coli bacteria, and listeria monocytogenes, as well as the emergence of antibiotic-resistant organisms associated with contamination of the food supply; and WHEREAS, the taxpaying consumers have made a huge investment in food safety and have the right to know that their food supply is protected, and United States growers and producers are subject to numerous regulations designed to protect food safety. The co-mingling of food produced and processed under these rigorous standards with food from other sources is a practice that undermines the credibility of our food system; and WHEREAS, the agricultural sector of the American economy is capable of providing a safe and sufficient food supply to meet the needs of the American people and to avoid some of the more serious sources of food-borne illnesses: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the House of Representatives of the Seventy- sixth Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the Senate concurring therein, that the South Dakota Legislature urges Congress to impose a moratorium on all imports of live cattle, beef, pre-cooked beef, and all beef products for a period of three years or until importers can prove that the cattle and beef are free of Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy or mad cow disease and free of foot and mouth disease for the protection of the American consumer."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 16711, "action_date": "2001-03-21T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 91298, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/91298.pdf", "status_text": "Adopt Resolution", "journal_page": 905, "committee_id_action": 712, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "F", "vote": {"vote_id": 51796, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [2514, 2515, 2522, 2525, 2526, 2528, 2533, 2537, 2538, 2544, 2545, 2553, 2556, 2557, 2558, 2559, 2563, 2565, 2570, 2571, 2575, 2577, 2578, 2579, 2582, 2583, 2586, 2588, 2592, 2593, 2595, 2596, 2600, 2601, 2603, 2604, 2605, 2610, 2612, 2613, 2618, 2540], "Yea": [2518, 2519, 2521, 2527, 2530, 2541, 2543, 2546, 2547, 2548, 2554, 2555, 2560, 2561, 2566, 2568, 2572, 2574, 2587, 2589, 2591, 2594, 2599, 2602, 2608, 2611, 2614], "Excused": [2564]}}]}
