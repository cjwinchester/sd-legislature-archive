No person may vote a party ballot at any primary election unless the person is registered as a member of that political party in the precinct in which the person seeks to vote. Any political party in its Constitution or bylaws as filed pursuant to \u00a7 12-5-1.1 may allow for participation in the party's primary elections by any person who is registered to vote with no party affiliation. At a primary election, the person may vote for candidates of any political party on the ballot, regardless of the voter's party affiliation. However, the person may vote for candidates of only one political party on the primary ballot. If a primary ballot contains votes for the candidates of more than one political party, the ballot is defective and no vote on the ballot may be counted. Section 3. That chapter 12-6 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: The primary election ballot shall have at least three vertical columns on the ballot and each political party shall have a separate column headed by the words \"..........

The names of the candidates seeking the nomination of each political party shall be listed in that party's column. Notwithstanding the provisions of \u00a7 \u00a7 12-16-1 and 12-16-9, if only one person files for the nomination of a political party for an office, the person's name shall be placed on the primary ballot at the appropriate location in that party's column. The names of candidates for nomination of the political party that received the smallest average vote at the last state general election are placed in the first column on the left side of the ballot. The names of candidates for nomination of the political party that received the next smallest average vote at the last state general election are placed in the second column, and so on. For the purposes of this section, the average number of votes of a political party is computed by dividing the total number of votes counted for all of the party's candidates for statewide office at the most recent state general election by the number of those candidates at the election. Section 4. That \u00a7 12-6-50 be amended to read as follows: 12-6-50.

However, if there is a tie for second place in the first primary election and there is no tie for first place, all tying second place candidates shall be placed along with the first place candidate on the ballot for the secondary election. The secondary election shall be held at the same polling places, be conducted, returned, and canvassed and the results declared in the same manner as the first election.
