WHEREAS, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates alcohol harm costs to South Dakota taxpayers and businesses at around six hundred million dollars annually; and WHEREAS, alcohol excise tax and other revenues from alcohol to the state of South Dakota are estimated to be around twenty million dollars per year; and WHEREAS, the remaining five hundred eighty million dollars (which equates to ninety-seven percent of alcohol harm costs) is paid for by hard working South Dakota families and small businesses, while the alcohol industry and heavy alcohol consumers pay only three percent of alcohol harm costs; and WHEREAS, responsible and moderate alcohol consumers would pay significantly less in total taxes (including property, sales, and other taxes) over time if alcohol were taxed at a higher rate; and WHEREAS, alcohol excise taxes in South Dakota have not been raised since 1987; and WHEREAS, alcohol excise taxes have not kept pace with inflation, resulting in a near fifty percent loss in value over the last thirty years; and WHEREAS, by not indexing alcohol excise taxes to inflation, the state of South Dakota has forgone over one hundred fifty million dollars in unrealized alcohol excise tax revenue much of which has gone into the pockets of out-of-state owned and operated alcohol interests; and WHEREAS, lower alcohol prices are known to increase problematic alcohol consumption among heavy consumers of alcohol and underage consumers of alcohol; and WHEREAS, problematic consumption of alcohol is associated with increased crime, including violent crime; and WHEREAS, for over a decade, South Dakota has consistently ranked at the top of the list for alcohol-related crime; and WHEREAS, alcohol harm costs are among the top expense items for counties across the state, leaving counties with no other option than to raise property taxes to pay for alcohol harm mitigation costs; and WHEREAS, research has found that the only consumers who are significantly price sensitive are those who consume alcohol problematically (over ten drinks per day) and underage drinkers; and WHEREAS, research shows that, like with tobacco and groceries, consumers of alcohol very rarely travel to other states to purchase alcohol products for the purpose of saving money; and WHEREAS, research and experience from other states where alcohol excise taxes have been increased also reported a net increase in jobs, especially when the revenue is directed to alcohol cost mitigation areas such as healthcare, social services, and public safety: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the House of Representatives of the Ninety- Third Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the Senate concurring therein, that the South Dakota Legislature recognizes the importance thoughtful taxation of alcohol products in South Dakota and agrees that alcohol ought to become budget-neutral rather than a drain on resources and the economy of South Dakota."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 9091, "action_date": "2018-02-01T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 48515, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/48515.pdf", "status_text": "First read and referred to", "journal_page": 279, "committee_id_action": 396, "committee_id_assigned": 391, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 9091, "action_date": "2018-02-05T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 48692, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/48692.pdf", "status_text": "Referred to", "journal_page": 332, "committee_id_action": 396, "committee_id_assigned": 387, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 9091, "action_date": "2018-02-08T08:30:00-06:00", "document_id": 48787, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/48787.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 387, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 9091, "action_date": "2018-02-08T08:30:00-06:00", "document_id": 48946, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/48946.pdf", "status_text": "Do Not Adopt Resolution", "journal_page": 387, "committee_id_action": 387, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 25566, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [1266, 1301, 1235, 1425, 1286, 1261, 1305, 1287], "Excused": [1282, 1313], "Nay": [1274, 1298, 1250]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/9091"}
