WHEREAS, South Dakota's veterans have risked life and limb, in every clime and place, and have never lost their nerve, in answering the call of duty of our nation and state. South Dakotans gratefully acknowledge our veterans' service, sacrifices, and dedication to We the People of this great state; and WHEREAS, South Dakota legislators acknowledge receipt of repeated requests from members of the American Legion, Veterans of Foreign Wars, Disabled American Veterans, Marine Corps League, Paralyzed Veterans of America, Military Order of the Purple Heart, and Fleet Reserve Association, as well as individual South Dakota veterans, to establish a veterans cemetery in eastern South Dakota and for the State of South Dakota to provide accurate official numbers of veterans and disabled veterans employed as state employees; and WHEREAS, the federal government currently collects and publically disseminates accurate official statistical employment information from federal employees regarding veteran/disabled veteran status, with the full support of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The federal government does so to monitor and attempt to ensure that America's veterans are not being discriminated against in federal employment preference; and WHEREAS, South Dakota Codified Law 3-3-1 requires veterans and veterans with service connected disabilities to be given preference in public employment. However, the Department of Human Resources currently does not compile accurate official statistical information from state employees regarding their veteran/disabled veteran status; and WHEREAS, we the duly elected legislators of the people, are committed to ensuring that the will of the people of South Dakota to support our veterans is respected and accomplished; and WHEREAS, in opposing recent failed legislation requiring such measures, Department of Veterans Affairs personnel indicated they would be \"proactive\" on these issues if left to their own devices: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the House of Representatives of the Eighty-Eighth Legislature of the State of South Dakota, that the South Dakota House of Representatives expresses its support for establishing a state veterans cemetery in eastern South Dakota and for employment measures to ensure that South Dakota's veterans and disabled veterans are not discriminated against and are provided state employment preference in accordance with the wishes of South Dakota citizens and as required by state law; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the South Dakota Department of Veterans Affairs and Department of Human Resources are strongly urged to be proactive in addressing these issues."}, {"bill_id": 4473, "bill_version_id": 26389, "bill_version": "Enrolled", "bill_version_date": "2013-02-26T09:27:37.16-06:00", "bill_text": ""}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 4473, "action_date": "2013-02-22T12:30:00-06:00", "document_id": 26261, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/26261.pdf", "status_text": "First Reading", "journal_page": 502, "committee_id_action": 202, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 4473, "action_date": "2013-02-25T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 26348, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/26348.pdf", "status_text": "Adopt Resolution", "journal_page": 519, "committee_id_action": 202, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 14302, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [420, 346, 415, 418, 326, 360, 417, 349, 382, 410, 412, 398, 342, 324, 348, 318, 397, 374, 402, 381, 396, 370, 394, 413, 372, 350, 347, 416, 389, 351, 344, 359, 392, 335, 369, 414, 400, 375, 371, 380, 316, 332, 393, 395, 390, 408, 404, 405, 356, 411, 377, 355, 378, 407, 352, 357, 403, 343, 399, 323, 406, 361, 391, 354, 409, 373, 353, 341, 334], "Excused": [401]}}]}
