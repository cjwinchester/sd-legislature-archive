Any person who is required to file and pay tax pursuant to this chapter and whose tax year ends on a date other than December thirty-first, shall file with the Department of Revenue and Regulation a quarterly estimate of tax due for the current year and make payment of the estimated amount less any tax credit authorized pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 10-43- 78 to 10-43-86, inclusive, on the fifteenth day of the month following the end of the quarter for which the estimate is due . If the tax year of the person ends on December thirty-first, the estimated amount shall be paid on or before the fifteenth day of January, April, July, and October of each year. If the tax year of the person ends on a date other than December thirty- first, the estimated amount shall be made on or before the fifteenth day of the month following the end of the quarter for which the estimate is due. In determining the amount of each quarterly payment, the taxpayer shall estimate his the taxpayer's total tax liability for the entire tax year and make payment of one-fourth of the estimate less one-fourth of any tax credit for the year authorized pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 10-43-78 to 10-43-86, inclusive .

Any tax due but not paid on the due date is delinquent and bears penalty and interest as provided in \u00a7 10-59-6. Section 2. That \u00a7 10-43-30.1 be amended to read as follows: 10-43-30.1.
