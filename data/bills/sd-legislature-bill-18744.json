Any territory organized for the express purpose of operating not less than a thirteen-year six-year school program and governed by an elected school board is defined to be a school district. It may sue and be sued, contract and be contracted with, purchase, hold, and use personal and real property for school purposes, and sell and dispose of the same property . Section 2. That \u00a7 13-5-35 be amended to read as follows: 13-5-35. No school district may be formed after July 1, 1998, unless it operates both an elementary and a secondary school within the boundaries of the district. No existing or newly- formed school district need operate a secondary school. However, it shall, at a minimum, operate an elementary school that serves students in kindergarten to grade five, inclusive. Any school district that does not operate a secondary school shall pay to the receiving school district an amount of money for each resident student from the sending district who is enrolled in grades six to twelve, inclusive, in the receiving district. The amount shall be sufficient to offset any additional costs to the receiving school district for the capital outlay fund, special education fund, and pension fund resulting from the student's enrollment and not covered by the student's share of state aid distributed to the receiving district pursuant to chapter 13-13."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 18744, "action_date": "2004-01-20T12:15:00-06:00", "document_id": 99372, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/99372.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 114, "committee_id_action": 831, "committee_id_assigned": 820, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 18744, "action_date": "2004-01-23T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 99765, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/99765.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 820, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 18744, "action_date": "2004-01-23T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 99765, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/99765.pdf", "status_text": "Tabled", "journal_page": 192, "committee_id_action": 820, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 58427, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [3049, 3088], "Yea": [3051, 3053, 3067, 3069, 3082, 3104, 3108, 3110, 3131, 3141, 3145, 3083], "Absent": [3107]}}, {"bill_id": 18744, "action_date": "2004-01-23T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 99765, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/99765.pdf", "status_text": "Tabled", "journal_page": 192, "committee_id_action": 820, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 58427, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [3049, 3088], "Yea": [3051, 3053, 3067, 3069, 3082, 3104, 3108, 3110, 3131, 3141, 3145, 3083], "Absent": [3107]}}]}
