Where a divorce is granted, the court may compel one party to make such suitable allowance to the other party for support during the life of that other party or for a shorter period, as the court may deem just, having regard to the circumstances of the parties represented; and the court may from time to time modify its orders in these respects. If the party receiving the support cohabitates with another or becomes pregnant by another, the party paying the support may petition the court, and upon finding that the party receiving the support cohabitates with another or became pregnant by another, the court shall terminate the support allowance. 300 copies of this document were printed by the South Dakota Legislative Research Council at a cost of $.029 per page. .
