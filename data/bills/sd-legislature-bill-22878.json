Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of South Dakota: Section 1. That a NEW SECTION be added to title 40: Terms used in this chapter mean: (1) \"Committee,\" the committee created by a meat-processing employer to develop and implement a safe worker program; (2) \"Coordinator,\" the meatpacking industry worker rights coordinator; (3) \"Meat-processing employer,\" a business that employs at least one hundred workers and in which slaughtering, butchering, meat canning, meatpacking, meat manufacturing, poultry canning, poultry packing, poultry manufacturing, pet food manufacturing, egg production, processing of meat products, or rendering occurs. The term does not mean a grocery store, deli, restaurant, or other commercial entity that prepares meat products for immediate consumption; (4) \"Public health emergency,\" a state declared public health emergency pursuant to \u00a7 34-22-42, a federal public health emergency declared by the secretary of the United States Department of Health and Human Services, or a national emergency declared by the president due to infectious disease or another significant threat to public health; (5) \"Worker,\" any individual that is employed for a meat-processing employer. The term includes independent contractors, persons performing work for a meat-processing employer through a temporary service or staffing agency, and persons employed but not directly in contact with raw food products. Section 2. That a NEW SECTION be added to title 40: The secretary of the Department of Labor and Regulation shall appoint a meatpacking industry worker rights coordinator. The coordinator shall enforce the provisions of this chapter, and review and recommend improvements to the practices and procedures of meat-processing employers in this state. An employer must grant the coordinator full access to its facilities in this state at any time processing is occurring and workers are present. The coordinator position must be budgeted through the normal budget process. The Department of Labor and Regulation shall provide necessary office space and assistance to the coordinator. Section 3. That a NEW SECTION be added to title 40: The coordinator shall, on or before December first each year, electronically submit a report to the members of the Legislature and the Governor. The report must include any recommended actions from the coordinator to promote better treatment of workers by meat-processing employers. Section 4. That a NEW SECTION be added to title 40: A worker has the right to refuse to work under conditions that the worker reasonably believes would expose the worker, other workers, or the public to an unreasonable risk of illness or injury, or that causes the worker, other workers, or the public illness or injury. A meat-processing employer may not discriminate or take adverse action against any worker for a good faith refusal to work, if the worker has requested that the employer correct a hazardous condition, and the condition remains uncorrected. A worker who has refused, in good faith, to work in a hazardous condition under this section, and who has not been reassigned to other work by the employer, retains the right to: (1) Continued employment; and (2) Payment by the employer for the hours that would have been worked, until the employer can demonstrate that the condition has been remedied. Section 5. That a NEW SECTION be added to title 40: If a meat-processing employer discriminates or takes adverse action against any worker for a good faith refusal to work in violation of section 4 of this Act, relief is: (1) Reinstatement of the worker to the same position held before any adverse personnel action, or to an equivalent position; reinstatement of full fringe benefits and seniority rights; and compensation for unpaid wages, benefits, and other remuneration, or front pay instead of reinstatement; and (2) Compensatory damages payable to the aggrieved worker equal to the greater of five thousand dollars or twice the actual damages, and punitive damages. Section 6. That a NEW SECTION be added to title 40: No meat-processing employer may discriminate or take adverse action against any worker or other person who raises a concern about an employer's health and safety practices or hazards to the employer, the employer's agent, other workers, a government entity, or the public. If an employer takes adverse action against a worker or other person within ninety days of the worker's or other person's engagement or attempt to engage in an activity protected by this chapter, the action is presumed retaliatory. The presumption may be rebutted by clear and convincing evidence that the action was taken for other, permissible reasons. No employer may require a worker to sign a contract or other agreement that would limit the worker from disclosing information about workplace health and safety practices or hazards, or to otherwise abide by a workplace policy that would limit or prevent such disclosures. The agreement or policy is void and unenforceable as contrary to the public policy of this state. Any attempt by an employer to impose the agreement or policy is an adverse action under this chapter. Section 7. That a NEW SECTION be added to title 40: Reporting or threatening to report a worker's suspected citizenship or immigration status, or the suspected citizenship or immigration status of a family member of a worker to a federal, state, or local agency because the worker exercises a right under the provisions of this chapter, constitutes an adverse action. For the purposes of this section, the term, family member, means a spouse, parent, sibling, child, uncle, aunt, niece, nephew, cousin, grandparent, or grandchild related by blood, adoption, marriage, or domestic partnership. Section 8. That a NEW SECTION be added to title 40: Any worker who brings a complaint under sections 6 or 7 of this Act and suffers retaliation is entitled to treble damages in addition to lost pay and recovery of attorney fees and costs. Any company who is found to have retaliated against any worker shall pay a fine of twenty-five thousand dollars to the Department of Labor and Regulation. Section 9. That a NEW SECTION be added to title 40: The coordinator may, on the coordinator's own initiative or after receiving a complaint, inspect a meat-processing employer's facilities. The coordinator may subpoena records and witnesses. If an employer does not comply with the coordinator's inspection, the coordinator may seek relief as provided by this chapter. If an employer does not comply with a provision of this chapter, a person may bring a civil action in a court of competent jurisdiction within three years of an alleged violation, and, upon prevailing, may be awarded the relief provided in section 10 of this Act. Pursuing administrative relief is not a prerequisite for bringing a civil action. The attorney general or a state's attorney may enforce the provisions of this chapter and may inspect an employer and subpoena records and witnesses. If the attorney general or a state's attorney determines that a violation has occurred, the attorney general or state's attorney may bring a civil action as provided in section 10 of this Act. Section 10. That a NEW SECTION be added to title 40: In a civil action or administrative proceeding brought to enforce this chapter, the court or coordinator must order relief for any violation of any provision of this chapter as follows: (1) An injunction to order compliance and restrain continued violations; (2) Payment to a prevailing worker by a meat-processing employer of reasonable costs, disbursements, and attorneys' fees; and (3) A civil penalty payable to the state of not less than one hundred dollars per day per worker affected by the meat-processing employer's noncompliance with this chapter. Section 11. That a NEW SECTION be added to title 40: The relief provided in this chapter may be recovered through a private civil action brought on behalf of the Department of Labor and Regulation in a court of competent jurisdiction by another individual. The individual must give written notice to the coordinator of the provision of this chapter alleged to have been violated. The individual may commence a civil action under this section if no inspection or investigative action is taken by the coordinator within thirty days. Any civil penalty recovered pursuant to this section must be distributed as follows: (1) Seventy percent to the department; and (2) Thirty percent to the individual. The right to bring an action under this section may not be impaired by private contract. Section 12. That a NEW SECTION be added: For purposes of the reemployment assistance program, a worker: (1) Who left employment because the worker's meat-processing employer failed to resolve a working condition that made the work environment unsuitable for health or safety reasons has good cause for leaving employment; (2) Has exhausted reasonable alternatives to leaving if the worker, authorized employee representative, or another worker notified the employer of the unsafe or unhealthy working condition and the employer did not resolve it, or if the employer knew or should have had reason to know that the condition made the work environment unsuitable and did not resolve it; (3) Has good cause to refuse an offer of employment or reemployment if the employer has not resolved a working condition that makes the work environment unsuitable for health or safety reasons, (4) Has good cause to refuse an offer of employment or reemployment from a meat-processing employer if the conditions of work would require the worker to violate government public health guidance or to assume unreasonable health risk; (5) Has good cause to refuse an offer of employment or reemployment from a meat-processing employer if the worker must care for a child whose school is closed due to a public health emergency or if the worker must otherwise care for a family or household member during a public health emergency; (6) Has good cause, during a public health emergency, to leave employment if the worker leaves to care for a seriously ill or quarantined family or household member; and (7) May not be required, during a public health emergency, to prove that a working condition that made the environment unsuitable for health or safety reasons was unique to the worker or that the risk was not customary to the worker's occupation.

The safe worker program must be developed and implemented by a committee of individuals who are knowledgeable of the tasks and work processes performed by workers at the employer's facilities. The committee must include: (1) A certified professional ergonomist; (2) A physician licensed pursuant to chapter 36-4, with preference given to a physician who has specialized experience and training in occupational medicine; and (3) At least three workers employed in the employer's facility who have completed a general industry outreach course approved by the secretary of the Department of Labor and Regulation, one of whom must be an authorized employee representative if the employer is party to a collective bargaining agreement. Section 14. That a NEW SECTION be added to title 40: A committee shall: (1) Establish written procedures to identify ergonomic hazards and contributing risk factors. The procedures must include: (a) The ergonomic assessment tools used to measure ergonomic hazards; (b) All jobs where the committee has an indication or knowledge that ergonomic hazards may exist; and (c) Workers who perform the same job, or a sample of workers in that job, who have the greatest exposure to the ergonomic hazard; (2) Conduct ergonomic assessments to identify hazards and contributing risk factors; (3) Review all surveillance data at least quarterly to identify ergonomic hazards and contributing factors; and (4) Maintain records of the hazard identification process.

The plan must: (1) Set goals, priorities, and a timeline to eliminate, prevent, or control the ergonomic hazards and contributing risk factors identified; (2) Identify any persons responsible for ergonomic hazard assessments and implementation of controls; (3) Rely upon the surveillance data and ergonomic risk assessment results; and (4) Consider the severity of the risk, the number of workers at risk, and the likelihood that the intervention will reduce the risk. A meat-processing employer must control, reduce, or eliminate ergonomic hazards that lead to musculoskeletal disorders to the extent feasible by using engineering, work practice, or administrative controls. The committee shall monitor, at least annually, the implementation of the plan and evaluate the progress in meeting program goals. Section 16.

The employer shall provide the worker an opportunity, within thirty days of receiving the new task training, to receive a refresher training on the topics covered in the new task training. The employer must provide the training in a language and with vocabulary the worker can understand. Section 18.
