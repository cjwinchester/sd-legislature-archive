Any student in grades nine, ten, eleven, or twelve may apply to an institution of higher education or a postsecondary technical institute as a special student in a course or courses offered at the institution of higher education or postsecondary technical institute. The institution of higher education or postsecondary technical institute shall set admission standards and tuition rates. The student shall obtain the school district's approval of the postsecondary course or courses prior to enrolling. If, however, the student is enrolled in a nonpublic school or a tribal school, the student shall obtain approval of the postsecondary course or courses from the nonpublic school or the tribal school prior to enrolling, and if the student is receiving alternative instruction pursuant to \u00a7 13-27-3, the student shall obtain approval of the postsecondary course or courses prior to enrolling from the provider of the alternative instruction. If approved, the student shall receive full credit toward high school graduation as well as postsecondary credit for each postsecondary course.

The student is responsible for any tuition and fees not paid by the school district or the state and for any other costs involved with attending a postsecondary institution. The school district shall record each course under this section on the student's transcript and shall use each course score to calculate academic standing.

A participating institution shall regularly submit course availability, enrollment, and completion data to the Department of Education.
