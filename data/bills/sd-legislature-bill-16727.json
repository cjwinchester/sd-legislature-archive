Section 3. The state shall be divided into thirty-five representative districts, which shall be the same as the senatorial districts provided in section 2 of this Act, and the House of Representatives shall consist of seventy members. Section 4. Each senatorial district as provided for in section 2 of this Act is entitled to one senator. Section 5. Each representative district as provided for in section 3 of this Act is entitled to two representatives. However, in order to protect minority voting rights, District No. 28 shall consist of two single-member house districts as follows: (1) District No. 28A: Dewey and Ziebach counties and that portion of Corson County consisting of Bullhead Voting District, Little Eagle-Ridgeland Voting District, Little Oak Voting District, Mahto Voting District, and Wakpala-Mission Voting District. (2) District No. 28B: Harding and Perkins counties and that portion of Butte County consisting of Castle Rock Voting District, Union Voting District, Romans Voting District, Orman Voting District, Horsecreek Voting District, Newell Independent Voting District, Minnesela Voting District, Newell City Voting District, and that portion of Corson County consisting of Delaney Voting District, Grand Valley Voting District, Lincoln-Kenel Voting District, Liberty Voting District, McIntosh Voting District, Morristown Voting District, Watauga Voting District, East City Ward 1 Voting District, East City Ward 3 Voting District, Lincoln-Kenel Ward I-McLaughlin Voting District, and Lincoln-Kenel Ward 2-McLaughlin Voting District, and that portion of Meade County consisting of Faith Voting District. Section 6. The Legislature finds that, for the purposes of this Act, the ideal population of a senatorial district, based on the official 2000 federal census, is 21,567 people. Section 7. For the purposes of this Act, county, municipal, township, precinct, and federal census enumeration district boundaries named in this Act, are deemed to be those boundaries in existence on April 1, 2000, as utilized for the making of the 2000 federal census as noted on the federal census county, municipality, township, and enumeration district maps filed by the Legislature on October 26, 2001, in the Office of the Secretary of State. The Legislature finds that the maps, or their electronic equivalent, as issued by the Census Bureau, constitute the only valid base of population information available for the purposes of this Act. For purposes of legislative districts, these county, municipal, township, and federal census enumeration district boundaries are not subject to change. Section 8. If any area of this state is omitted from the provisions of this Act, the county auditor of the county containing such area shall attach the area to the district that surrounds it or, if the area is contiguous to two or more districts, the county auditor shall attach it to the contiguous district that has the least population according to the official 2000 federal census. Any attachments made pursuant to this section shall be certified in writing and filed with the secretary of state. No changes may be made in any such attachments until the next decennial redistricting. Section 9. That \u00a7 \u00a7 2-2-23 to 2-2-31, inclusive, be repealed."}, {"bill_id": 16727, "bill_version_id": 91618, "bill_version": "Enrolled", "bill_version_date": "2001-10-24T10:48:54-05:00", "bill_text":
