WHEREAS, on March 23, 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, also known as Obamacare, amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, passed by the unsavory political maneuvering of reconciliation, was enacted by completely partisan votes, i.e. not one Republican vote, in both the U.S. Senate and the U.S. House of Representatives; and WHEREAS, since 2010, many South Dakota politicians have campaigned claiming to be opposed to Obamacare and to be dedicated to preventing the enactment and implementation of Obamacare; and WHEREAS, on February 23, 2010, SB 137, an Act to nullify Obamacare, was defeated; and WHEREAS, on March 23, 2010, the South Dakota attorney general joined Florida and twelve other states in a lawsuit contesting that Obamacare was unconstitutional; and WHEREAS, between July 15 - September 29, 2010, South Dakota state governmental agencies received six Obamacare grants to enact and implement Obamacare provisions, which they previously applied for, totaling $2,860,314.00; and WHEREAS, in December 2010, SB 38 and SB 43 were prefiled and subsequently passed during the 2011 South Dakota Legislative Session, which enacted changes to South Dakota Codified Law to facilitate enactment and implementation of Obamacare; and WHEREAS, on February 9, 2011, HB 1165 to prohibit the enforcement of Obamacare in South Dakota, was defeated; and WHEREAS, between August 11 - September 24, 2011, South Dakota state governmental agencies received five Obamacare grants to enact and implement Obamacare provisions, which they previously applied for, totaling $3,774,653.00; and WHEREAS, on September 28, 2011, the South Dakota attorney general joined other states in challenging the constitutionality of Obamacare to the Supreme Court of the United States of America; and WHEREAS, on February 7, 2012, HB 1191, an Act to provide for an interstate compact on public health care, to establish an interstate advisory health care commission, to specify the relationship between the member states and the federal government, and to assert the right to federal funding in lieu of certain federally funded incentives, was defeated; and WHEREAS, on February 13, 2012, HB 1165, a repeal of 2011's SB 43, was defeated; and WHEREAS, on February 13, 2012, HB 1167, a repeal of 2011's SB 38, was defeated; and WHEREAS, on February 15, 2012, HB 1190, an Act to require Legislative approval before a health insurance exchange is created or implemented, was defeated; and WHEREAS, on July 1, 2012, HB 1185 became law when it was passed to prohibit all qualified health plans offered through Obamacare health care exchanges in South Dakota, including abortion coverage; and WHEREAS, on July 1, 2012, HB 1220 became law when it was passed to conditionally repeal certain provisions enacting and implementing Obamcare provisions into SDCL via 2011 legislation in the event Obamacare was found to be unconstitutional; and WHEREAS, between May 16 - September 25, 2012, South Dakota state governmental agencies received five Obamacare grants to enact and implement Obamacare provisions, which they previously applied for, totaling $7,363,460.00; and WHEREAS, on June 28, 2012, the Supreme Court of the United States of America ruled that Obamacare was a tax and therefore constitutionally enacted; and WHEREAS, on February 4, 2013, HB 1244, an Act to prohibit the expansion of Medicaid eligibility under Obamacare, was defeated; and WHEREAS, on July 1, 2013, SB 139 became law when it was passed to regulate certain market activity in an enacted Obamacare health exchange in South Dakota; and WHEREAS, on July 1, 2013, HB 1103 became law when it was passed to exempt credit health insurers from certain provisions related to preexisting conditions; and WHEREAS, between June 25 - September 20, 2013, South Dakota state governmental agencies received five Obamacare grants to enact and implement Obamacare provisions, which they previously applied for, totaling $3,686,723.00; and WHEREAS, all reliable public opinion polls continue to show that less than half of the population supports the unpopular Obamacare, and support continues to decline as more and more details of the costly law take effect and Americans lose their current health care coverage; and WHEREAS, health care costs are already rising and are projected to rise more by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates for this program, and the data is showing that the care and cost for those with health insurance will rise to compensate for those not being presently covered; and WHEREAS, employers, especially those employing over fifty employees, are finding it impractical to employ more full-time employees due to these onerous costs, because it is impractical, expensive, and harms the businesses; and WHEREAS, the Obama Administration recently delayed the employer mandate, but unfairly is still forcing individuals and families to pay to implement an individual mandate; and WHEREAS, both public and private unions have petitioned for waivers to be released from the mandates of Obamacare, and recently, having discovered the details of the plan, are calling for repeal or fixes to the law; and WHEREAS, health care should remain in the hands of citizens, not bureaucrats; and WHEREAS, Obamacare will result in the IRS alone hiring more than 12,000 new agents to ensure compliance, while more and more regular Americans lose full-time work by the day; and WHEREAS, the implementation of Obamacare has already prompted large corporations like UPS, Home Depot, Walmart and others to dramatically revamp or eliminate their employee health care plans, and reduce workers to part-time status to avoid Obamacare's draconian mandates, causing great suffering for middle-class American families; and WHEREAS, the average family of four will spend an additional $4,000 annually in health care costs by 2016 if Obamacare continues to be implemented; and WHEREAS, government will collect more than $1.3 TRILLION in new taxes over the next decade on everything from prescription drugs and private insurance plans to medical device manufacturers; and WHEREAS, Obamacare forces free people, under the cover of a convoluted Supreme Court decision, to buy a product from a private company, which is fundamentally un-American, unconstitutional, and anathema to a country that was built on free market principles; and WHEREAS, the United States Office of Personnel Management has recently exempted Congress and its staff from Obamacare while forcing American taxpayers they are supposed to serve, into compliance with it; and WHEREAS, Congress has the power to stop Obamacare from being forced upon the people of the United States by introducing and securing passage of bills to repeal Obamacare as well as appropriations bills that exclude funding for Obamacare: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the House of Representatives of the Eighty-Ninth Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the Senate concurring therein, that the South Dakota Legislature urges South Dakota's Congressional delegation to support every effort by their Congressional colleagues to repeal and defund Obamacare; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Legislature urges Congress and President Obama to support such efforts as the will of the people."}, {"bill_id": 6061, "bill_version_id": 31559, "bill_version": "Senate Health and Human Services Engrossed", "bill_version_date": "2014-03-05T11:50:37.983-06:00", "bill_text": "A CONCURRENT RESOLUTION, Urging Congress to repeal and defund the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. WHEREAS, on March 23, 2010, Congress passed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, also referred to as the ACA, through a partisan effort without gaining a single Republican vote; and WHEREAS, since the ACA's inception, the State of South Dakota has consistently opposed the ACA due to the adverse consequences it has on the state and its constituents, and numerous state officials have called on Congress to repeal ACA; and WHEREAS, on March 23, 2010, the South Dakota attorney general joined Florida and twelve other states in a lawsuit to rule on the ACA as unconstitutional and defended that argument to the Supreme Court of the United States of America on September 28, 2011; and WHEREAS, the costs of implementing the ACA total nearly $1.8 trillion over the next 10 years and are only expected to exceed estimates, thus further compounding the national debt. The federal government seeks to offset these costs by imposing new taxes and penalties; and WHEREAS, financial impact and overall feasibility remain questionable as phases of implementation remain costly, chaotic, and unpredictable, while contributing to increasing federal regulation and bureaucratic control; and WHEREAS, Congress possesses the power to repeal the ACA and its funding souces: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the House of Representatives of the Eighty-Ninth Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the Senate concurring therein, that the South Dakota Legislature urges the
