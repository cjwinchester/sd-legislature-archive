Any building, institution, or establishment for which a license is issued under this chapter shall be inspected at least annually by a duly appointed representative of the State by the Department of Health under rules established by the department pursuant to \u00a7 34-12-13 in compliance with chapter 1-26. The provisions of this section do not apply to a licensed hospital or licensed chemical dependency treatment facility surveyed and accredited under the standards of the accreditation program of the joint commission on accreditation of health care organizations that submits to the State Department of Health department, within a reasonable time, copies of its currently valid accreditation certificate and accreditation letter, together with accompanying recommendations and comments and any further recommendations, progress reports, and correspondence directly related to the accreditation. However, the State Department of Health department may inspect all licensed hospitals or licensed chemical dependency treatment facilities to determine compliance with rules promulgated pursuant to subdivisions 34-12-13(1), (2), and (3). The State Department of Health department retains the right of access to all hospital or licensed chemical dependency treatment facility premises and to relevant records to investigate complaints or to follow through on corrective measures related to deficiencies identified by the joint commission survey process which are in conflict with state law or regulations promulgated thereunder rule. If, prior to an inspection, the operator refuses to allow the inspection, no inspection shall may be made. If, during the course of the inspection, the operator refuses to allow the inspection to continue, the inspection shall cease. In such cases, the department may immediately initiate revocation proceedings pursuant to chapter 1-26 against the operator's license."}, {"bill_id": 7061, "bill_version_id": 38237, "bill_version":
