Section 2. Except as provided in section 3 of this Act, no person may operate a motor vehicle upon a public highway while using a mobile telephone to engage in a call while such vehicle is in motion. An operator of a motor vehicle who holds a mobile telephone to, or in the immediate proximity of his or her ear while such vehicle is in motion is presumed to be engaging in a call within the meaning of this section. The presumption established by this section is rebuttable by evidence tending to show that the operator was not engaged in a call. The provisions of this section may not be construed as authorizing the seizure or forfeiture of a mobile telephone, unless otherwise provided by law. A law enforcement officer shall issue a warning for a first violation of this section. Any subsequent violation of this section is a traffic infraction and is punishable by a fine of not more than one hundred dollars. Section 3. The provisions of section 2 of this Act do not apply to: (1) The use of a mobile telephone for the sole purpose of communicating with any of the following regarding an emergency situation: an emergency response operator; a hospital, physician's office, or health clinic; an ambulance company or corps; a fire department, district, or company; or a police department; (2) Any of the following persons while in the performance of their official duties: a law enforcement officer; a member of a fire department, district, or company; the operator of an authorized emergency vehicle; or the operator of an authorized school district vehicle; or (3) The use of a hands-free mobile telephone. Section 4. The court shall waive any fine of any person who violates section 2 of this Act if such person proves to the court that, between the date of the violation and the appearance date for such violation, the violator has aquired a hands-free mobile telephone as defined in this Act. However, such waiver of the fine does not apply to a second or subsequent violation under section 2 of this Act."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 16756, "action_date": "2002-01-10T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 91789, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/91789.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 41, "committee_id_action": 768, "committee_id_assigned": 765, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 16756, "action_date": "2002-01-23T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 92654, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/92654.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 765, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 16756, "action_date": "2002-01-23T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 92654, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/92654.pdf", "status_text": "Tabled", "journal_page": 248, "committee_id_action": 765, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 53350, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [2724, 2752, 2754, 2756, 2767, 2781, 2782, 2806, 2822, 2826, 2804, 2732], "Nay": [2783]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/16756"}
