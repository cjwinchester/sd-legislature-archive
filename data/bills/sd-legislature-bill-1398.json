BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That chapter 11-6 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Each municipality may exercise planning and zoning authority pursuant to Title 11, but within a certain distance from its corporate limits as established by this section. The distances are: (1) Each first class municipality may have planning and zoning authority within three miles of its corporate limits; (2) Each second class municipality may have planning and zoning authority within one mile of its corporate limits; and (3) Each third class municipality may have planning and zoning authority within one-half mile of its corporate limits. Section 2. That \u00a7 11-6-10 be amended to read as follows: 11-6-10. The legislative body of an incorporated municipality and a board of county commissioners may jointly exercise the comprehensive planning and zoning powers granted in this chapter and chapters 11-2 and 11-4 in a joint jurisdictional area beyond the municipal corporate limits. The joint jurisdictional area, not to exceed six miles the combined distance for the municipalities as defined in section 1 of this Act, shall be delineated in a comprehensive plan but in no instance may the area extend beyond a line equidistant from the corporate limits of any other municipality unless otherwise agreed to by a majority vote of the governing body of each municipality having a planning commission. Nothing contained in this chapter may be construed to amend or repeal any provisions of chapter 49-34A. The county and city planning commissions shall meet jointly and hold at least one public hearing on the comprehensive plan. Notice of the time and place of the hearing shall be given once by either the city or county at least ten days in advance by publication in a legal newspaper. Following the public hearing, each planning commission shall submit a recommendation to their respective governing body. Section 3. That \u00a7 11-6-26 be amended to read as follows: 11-6-26. After the city council of any municipality has adopted a comprehensive plan that includes at least a major street plan or has progressed in its comprehensive planning to the stage of making and adopting a major street plan, and has filed a certified copy of the major street plan in the office of the register of deeds of the county in which the municipality is located, no plat of a subdivision of land lying within the municipality, or of land within three miles of its corporate limits the distance of the municipality's corporate limits as defined in section 1 of this Act and not located in any other municipality, may be filed or recorded unless the plat has the recommendation of the city planning and zoning commission and the approval of the city council. As an alternative, the plat may be reviewed and approved in accordance with \u00a7 11-3-6. This provision applies to land within three miles of the corporate limits of the municipality the distance of the municipality's corporate limits as defined in section 1 of this Act and not located in any other municipality only if the comprehensive plan or major street plan includes such land. However, if such extra municipal land lies within three miles the planning and zoning authority of more than one first or second class municipality, the jurisdiction of each municipality terminates at a boundary line equidistant from the respective corporate limits of the municipalities, unless otherwise agreed to by a majority vote of the governing body of each such municipality. The plats shall, after report and recommendations of the commission are made and filed, be approved or disapproved by the city council or reviewed and approved in accordance with \u00a7 11-3-6. The commission shall make its recommendation to the council within sixty days of submission. Section 4. That \u00a7 11-6-40 be amended to read as follows: 11-6-40. Any municipality with a population of fifty thousand or more or any municipality located in a county with a population of fifty thousand or more, if such municipality has adopted a comprehensive plan pursuant to this chapter, the municipality may require by ordinance that any parcel of land of less than forty acres which is located within three miles of its corporate limits the distance of the municipality's corporate limits as defined in section 1 of this Act, be platted prior to the sale or transfer of the land. The register of deeds may not record any document of any sale or transfer of unplatted property if a municipality requires platting pursuant to this section. Section 5.
