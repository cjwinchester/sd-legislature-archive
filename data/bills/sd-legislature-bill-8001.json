A guardian of a protected person shall file a report with the court within sixty days following the first anniversary of the appointment and: (1) At least annually thereafter; (2) When the court orders additional reports to be filed; (3) When the guardian resigns or is removed; and (4) When the guardianship is terminated, unless the court determines that there is then no need therefor. A guardian may elect to file a periodic report on a calendar-year basis. However, in no event may such a report cover a period of more than one year. A calendar-year report shall be filed with the court no later than April fifteenth of the succeeding year. A report shall briefly state: (1) The current mental, physical, and social condition of the protected person; (2) The living arrangements during the reporting period; (3) The medical, educational, vocational, and other professional services provided to the protected person and the guardian's opinion as to the adequacy of the protected person's care; (4) A summary of the guardian's visits with and activities on the protected person's behalf; (5) If the protected person is institutionalized, whether the guardian agrees with the current treatment or habilitation plan; (6) A recommendation as to the need for continued guardianship and any recommended changes in the scope of the guardianship; (7) Any other information requested by the court or useful in the opinion of the guardian; and (8) The compensation requested and the reasonable and necessary expenses incurred by the guardian. A guardian shall mail a copy of the report to the individuals and entities specified in \u00a7 29A-5-410 no later than fourteen days following its filing. Any interested person may request a hearing on the report. The court may order the guardian to attend the hearing on the report on the court's own motion or on the petition of any interested person. A report of the guardian may be incorporated into and made a part of the accounting of the conservator. If, during the period intervening any annual report required under this section, there is a material adverse change in the medical condition of the minor or protected person that requires hospitalization or a change in residency that is more than a temporary change, unless otherwise ordered by the court, the guardian shall file a report with the court describing any change in medical condition or change in residency and provide reasonable and timely notice of any change in medical condition or change in residency to the individuals or entities specified in \u00a7 29A-5-410.
