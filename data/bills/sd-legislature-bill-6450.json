Any health carrier shall provide to any prospective enrollee written information describing the terms and conditions of the plan. If the plan is described orally, easily understood, truthful, objective terms shall be used. The written information need not be provided to any prospective enrollee who makes inquiries of a general nature directly to a carrier. In the solicitation of group coverage to an employer, a carrier is not required to provide the written information required by this section to individual employees or their dependents and if no solicitation is made directly to the employees or dependents and if no request to provide the written information to the employees or dependents is made by the employer. All written plan descriptions shall be readable, easily understood, truthful, and in an objective format.

If a period of time is extended as permitted by this chapter due to a claimant's failure to submit information necessary to decide a prospective, retrospective, or disability claim, the period for making the benefit determination shall be tolled from the date on which the notification of the extension is sent to the claimant until the date on which the claimant responds to the request for additional information.
