The Department of Education shall calculate the following for each school district: (1) The average teacher salary, based on data collected pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 13-8-47 and 13-3-51; (2) The increase in local need pursuant to \u00a7 13-13-10.1, excluding any effect due to change in the school district's fall enrollment and less the amount of revenue generated in school fiscal year 2016 pursuant to \u00a7 13-10-6 as a percentage increase, from fiscal year 2016 to fiscal year 2017; and (3) The increase in average teacher compensation as a percentage increase, as defined in \u00a7 13-8-47, from fiscal year 2016 to fiscal year 2017. For each school district, the district's increase in average teacher compensation from fiscal year 2016 to 2017 shall be equal to at least eighty-five percent of the district's increase in local need, as defined in subdivision (2), from fiscal year 2016 to fiscal year 2017 and, notwithstanding any negotiated agreement, at least eighty-five percent of the increase in state aid to general education funding the school district receives for fiscal year 2017 less the amount of revenue generated in fiscal year 2016 pursuant to \u00a7 13-10-6 shall be used to increase instructional salaries and benefits for certified instructional staff. If a district fails to comply with the requirements of this section, state aid to general education funding to the district in fiscal year 2018 shall be decreased by an amount equal to fifty percent of the amount calculated in subdivision (2). For fiscal years 2019, 2020, and 2021, if a district's average teacher compensation is less than the district's average teacher compensation in fiscal year 2017, state aid to general education funding to the district in the following fiscal year shall be reduced by an amount equal to five hundred dollars for each teacher employed in the school district. However, if the Legislature fails in any fiscal year to increase the average teacher salary by the index factor outlined in \u00a7 13-13-10.1, the accountabilities under this section are suspended for that fiscal year but may not fall below the 2017 level. A school district may request a waiver from any penalty imposed under this section from the School Finance Accountability Board."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 9226, "action_date": "2018-02-01T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 48504, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/48504.pdf", "status_text": "First read in Senate and referred to", "journal_page": 330, "committee_id_action": 395, "committee_id_assigned": 370, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 9226, "action_date": "2018-02-13T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 48963, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/48963.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 370, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 9226, "action_date": "2018-02-20T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 49336, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/49336.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 370, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 9226, "action_date": "2018-02-20T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 49425, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/49425.pdf", "status_text": "Motion to amend", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 370, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 9226, "action_date": "2018-02-20T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 49425, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/49425.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass Amended", "journal_page": 494, "committee_id_action": 370, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 25975, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [1262, 1234, 1278, 1267, 1271], "Excused": [1245], "Nay": [1230]}}, {"bill_id": 9226, "action_date": "2018-02-22T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 49708, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/49708.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass Amended", "journal_page": 567, "committee_id_action": 395, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "F", "vote": {"vote_id": 26245, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [1239, 1230, 1264, 1231, 1217, 1246, 1273, 1278, 1304, 1270, 1267, 1244, 1281, 1221, 1272, 1245, 1271, 1252, 1220, 1242, 1276, 1300], "Yea": [1228, 1219, 1262, 1234, 1290, 1232, 1224, 1243, 1289, 1218, 1233, 1237, 1288]}}]}
