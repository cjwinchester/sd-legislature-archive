Section 2. That \u00a7 49-34B-3 be amended to read: 49-34B-3. There is created a pipeline safety inspection program. The federal safety standards adopted as Code of Federal Regulations, title 49 appendix, parts 191, 192, 193, and 199 as amended to January 1, 2016 2019, are adopted as minimum safety standards for this chapter. The commission shall establish and implement a compliance program to enforce these safety standards. The program shall be established and implemented in a manner that fully complies with requirements for state certification under the United States Code, title 49, section 60105, as amended to January 1, 2016 2019. Section 3. That \u00a7 49-34B-4 be amended to read: 49-34B-4. The commission may, by rules promulgated pursuant to chapter 1-26, establish safety standards, but not more stringent than federal safety standards as provided by \u00a7 49-34B-3, for the intrastate transportation of gas and gas pipeline facilities. The standards may apply to the design, installation, inspection, testing, construction, extension, operation, replacement, and maintenance of gas pipeline facilities. Standards affecting the design, installation, construction, initial inspection, and initial testing do not apply to pipeline facilities in existence on the date the standards are adopted by either this state or the federal government. The safety standards shall be practicable and designed to meet the need for pipeline safety. In prescribing the standards, the commission shall consider: (1) Relevant available pipeline safety data; (2) Whether the standards are appropriate for the particular type of pipeline transportation of gas; (3) The reasonableness of any proposed standards; (4) The extent to which the standard will contribute to public safety; and (5) The existing standards established by the secretary of the United States Department of Transportation pursuant to the United States Code, title 49, section 60101 et seq. as amended to January 1, 2016 2019.

The civil penalty may not exceed one two hundred thousand dollars for each violation each day that the violation persists, except that the maximum civil penalty may not exceed one two million dollars for any related series of violations. In determining the amount of the penalty upon finding a violation, or the amount of a compromise settlement, the commission shall consider the appropriateness of the penalty to the size of the business of the person charged, the gravity of the violation, prior offenses and compliance history, the good faith of the person charged in attempting to achieve compliance, and such other matters as justice may require. All penalties collected pursuant to this chapter shall be deposited in the state treasury to the credit of the pipeline safety account, established pursuant to \u00a7 49-34B-9. This section does not apply to interstate gas pipeline facilities. Section 5. That \u00a7 49-34B-13 be amended to read: 49-34B-13. No person is subject to civil penalties under this chapter if prior civil penalties have been imposed under the United States Code, title 49, section 60101 et seq. as amended to January 1, 2016 2019, for conduct that may give rise to a violation of both acts. Nothing in this chapter limits the powers of the commission, or precludes the pursuit of any other administrative, civil, injunctive, or criminal remedies by the commission or any other person. Administrative remedies need not be exhausted in order to proceed under this chapter. The remedies provided by this chapter are in addition to those provided under existing statutory or common law. Section 6. That \u00a7 49-34B-14 be amended to read: 49-34B-14. The commission may, to the extent authorized by agreement with the secretary of the United States Department of Transportation, act as agent for the secretary of transportation to implement the United States Code, title 49, section 60101 et seq. as amended to January 1, 2016 2019, and any federal pipeline safety regulations promulgated thereto with respect to interstate gas pipelines located within this state, as necessary to obtain annual federal certification.

The commission may seek and accept federal designation of the commission's pipeline inspectors as federal agents for the purposes of inspection pursuant to the United States Code, title 49, section 60101 et seq. as amended to January 1, 2016 2019, and federal rules adopted to implement those acts. If the Department of Transportation delegates inspection authority to the state as provided in this section, the commission shall do what is necessary to carry out its delegated federal authority. Section 8. That \u00a7 49-34B-19 be amended to read: 49-34B-19. The commission may promulgate pipeline inspection and safety rules, pursuant to chapter 1-26, to the extent necessary to enable the state to qualify for annual federal certification to operate the federal pipeline inspection program of intrastate and interstate gas pipelines as authorized by the United States Code, title 49, section 60101 et seq. as amended to January 1, 2016 2019. Section 9. That \u00a7 49-34B-22 be amended to read: 49-34B-22. All information reported to or obtained by the commission under this chapter that contains or relates to a trade secret referred to in United States Code, title 18, section 1905, as amended to January 1, 2016 2019, or that is granted by chapter 37-29 is confidential for the purpose of that section, except that the information may be disclosed to the commission or commission employee or agent concerned with enforcing this chapter.
