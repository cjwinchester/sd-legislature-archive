BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 23A-6-22.1 be amended to read as follows: 23A-6-22.1. Notwithstanding the provisions of \u00a7 23A-6-22, upon the request of any minor victim who is a minor or the minor victim's parent or guardian in a prosecution for rape, incest, or sexual contact, the court shall order that the name of the minor and the specific details of the alleged acts be suppressed if the trial court finds a compelling interest after consideration of the following factors: the minor victim's age, psychological maturity, and understanding, the nature of the crime, the desires of the victim, and the interests of the parents and relatives. Section 2. That \u00a7 23A-35-4.1 be amended to read as follows: 23A-35-4.1. If not filed earlier, any affidavit in support of a search warrant shall be filed with the court when the warrant and inventory are returned. Upon filing the warrant and supporting documents, the law enforcement officer may apply by separate affidavit to the court to seal the supporting affidavit from public inspection or disclosure. The court, for reasonable cause shown, may order the contents of the affidavit sealed from public inspection or disclosure but may not prohibit disclosure that a supporting affidavit was filed, the contents of the warrant, the return of the warrant, nor the inventory. The court may order that the supporting affidavit be sealed until the investigation is terminated or an indictment or information is filed. In cases of alleged rape, incest, or sexual contact, if the victim is a minor, the court may limit access to an affidavit pursuant to \u00a7 23A-6-22.1. However, a court order sealing a supporting affidavit may not affect the right of any defendant to discover the contents of the affidavit under chapter 23A-13. Section 3. That \u00a7 23A-2-2 be amended to read as follows: 23A-2-2. If it appears from a complaint, or from an affidavit or affidavits filed with a complaint, that there is probable cause to believe that an offense has been committed and that a particular person has committed it, a warrant for the arrest of that person, if requested by the prosecuting attorney, shall be issued to any officer authorized by law to execute it. If circumstances make it reasonable to do so in the absence of a written affidavit, an arrest warrant may be issued upon sworn oral testimony of a person who is not in the physical presence of a committing magistrate if the committing magistrate is satisfied that probable cause exists for the issuance of the warrant. The sworn oral testimony may be communicated to the magistrate by telephone or other appropriate means and shall be recorded and transcribed. After transcription the statement shall be certified by the magistrate and filed with the court. This statement shall be deemed to be an affidavit and complaint for purposes of this section. In cases of alleged rape, incest, or sexual contact, if the victim is a minor, the court may limit access to the affidavit pursuant to \u00a7 23A-6-22.1. Upon the request of the prosecuting attorney, a summons instead of a warrant shall be used. More than one warrant or summons may be issued on the same complaint.
