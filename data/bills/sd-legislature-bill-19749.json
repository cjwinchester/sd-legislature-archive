When counting a student who meets these criteria in its general enrollment average daily membership, the receiving district may begin the enrollment on the first day of attendance. The district of residence prior to the custodial transfer may not include students who meet these criteria in its general enrollment average daily membership after the student ceases to attend school in the resident district; (2) \"Adjusted average daily membership,\" calculated as follows: (a) For districts with an average daily membership of two hundred or less, multiply 1.2 times the average daily membership; (b) For districts with an average daily membership of less than six hundred, but greater than two hundred, raise the average daily membership to the 0.8293 power and multiply the result times 2.98; (c) For districts with an average daily membership of six hundred or more, multiply 1.0 times their average daily membership; (3) \" Index State index factor,\" for taxes payable in 2006, the state index factor is three and three-fourths percent, for taxes payable in 2007, the state index factor is four and one-half percent, and for taxes payable in 2008, the state index factor is five and one- fourth percent.

For taxes payable in 2009, and each year thereafter, the local index factor is the annual percentage change in the state's general fund revenue less any unexpended carryover and net transfers in for the year before the year immediately preceding the year of adjustment; (4) \" Per Total per student allocation,\" for school fiscal year 2005 is $4,086.56 $2,125.01 for the state and $1,961.55 for the school districts . Each school fiscal year thereafter, the total per student allocation is the sum of the previous fiscal year's total per student allocation increased by the state index factor and the local index factor, respectively ; (5) \"Local need,\" the per student allocation multiplied by the adjusted average daily membership; (6) \"Local effort,\" the amount of ad valorem taxes generated in a school fiscal year by applying the levies established pursuant to \u00a7 10-12-42; (7) \"General fund balance,\" the unreserved fund balance of the general fund, less general fund exclusions plus, beginning with transfers made in fiscal year 2001, any transfers out of the general fund for the previous school fiscal year; (8) \"General fund balance percentage,\" is a school district's general fund balance divided by the school district's total general fund expenditures for the previous school fiscal year, the quotient expressed as a percent; (9) \"General fund base percentage,\" is the general fund balance percentage as of June 30, 2000. However, the general fund base percentage can never increase and can never be less than twenty percent; (10) \"Allowable general fund balance,\" the fund base percentage multiplied by the district's general fund expenditures in the previous school fiscal year; (11) \"Imputed interest rate,\" the average prime rate for the preceding fiscal year minus 2.5 percentage points; (12) \"General fund exclusions,\" revenue a school district has received from the imposition of the excess tax levy pursuant to \u00a7 10-12-43; revenue a school district has received from gifts, contributions, grants, or donations; revenue a school district has received under the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 13-6-92 to 13-6-96, inclusive; and any revenue in the general fund set aside for a noninsurable judgment.

The secretary shall report to the Governor by January seventh of each year, the amount of state aid necessary to fully fund the general aid formula in the current year.

For each student, the amount of state aid paid shall be the total per student allocation as defined in subdivision 13-13- 10.1(4). The payment shall be prorated per the number of days the student was enrolled in the nonresident district compared to the number of days the nonresident district was in session. The payment shall be made in the succeeding fiscal year."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 19749, "action_date": "2005-01-27T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 103466, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/103466.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 202, "committee_id_action": 860, "committee_id_assigned": 849, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 19749, "action_date": "2005-02-04T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 104092, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/104092.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 849, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 19749, "action_date": "2005-02-08T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 104299, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/104299.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 849, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 19749, "action_date": "2005-02-10T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 104514, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/104514.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 849, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 19749, "action_date": "2005-02-10T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 104514, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/104514.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to 41st legislative day", "journal_page": 424, "committee_id_action": 849, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 59866, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [3156, 3169, 3233, 3251], "Yea": [3158, 3159, 3191, 3220, 3222, 3225, 3235, 3253, 3254, 3213, 3189]}}]}
