BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That chapter 1-25 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Any person may commence a civil action in circuit court in the county in which a public body ordinarily meets, for the purpose of enforcing a civil action regarding the open meeting provisions of this chapter against members of the public body. The action may only attempt to: (1) Require compliance with or prevent violations of the open meeting provisions of this chapter; (2) Obtain a civil penalty; and (3) Determine the applicability of this chapter to actions of public officials. An action under this section shall be commenced within sixty days of the public meeting or activity in question. The provisions of this section constitute the exclusive remedy for an alleged violation of this chapter. Section 2. That chapter 1-25 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Any public official who violates the open meeting provisions of this chapter is subject to personal liability by the imposition of a civil penalty in an amount not to exceed: (1) Fifty dollars for a first occurrence; (2) One hundred dollars for a second occurrence; or (3) Removal from office for a third or subsequent occurrence. The court shall order any public official found to have violated such provisions to personally pay any fine imposed under this section. A public body shall provide for legal defense against any action alleged to have been taken in violation of open meeting provisions. However, if a public official is found to have violated the provisions of this chapter intentionally, the public official shall reimburse the public body for all expenses and reasonable attorney fees in such action for such defense. Section 3. That chapter 1-25 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: If an action is brought pursuant to section 1 of this Act, the judge to whom the action is assigned shall immediately review the pleadings to determine if an undertaking, with or without a surety, is necessary. The court may hold a hearing on the matter. If the court deems it necessary, the court shall require such written undertaking by the plaintiff, with or without surety, as the court deems proper. Any surety shall be in an amount sufficient to pay potential expenses and attorney's fees of the public body if the court eventually determines that the plaintiff acted maliciously or frivolously in bringing the action. The amount of the surety may be adjusted from time to time as the court deems justified. If appropriate, the court may enter any such order for collection of such expenses and attorney's fees as it deems necessary. Section 4. That \u00a7 1-25-1 be amended to read as follows: 1-25-1. Except as otherwise provided by law, the official meetings of the state and the political subdivisions thereof, including all related boards, commissions, and other agencies, and the official meetings of boards, commissions, and agencies created by statute or which are nontaxpaying and derive a source of revenue directly from public funds, shall be open to the public, except as provided in this chapter. Meetings, including executive or closed meetings may be conducted by teleconference. Members shall be deemed present if they answer present to the roll call taken by teleconference. Any vote at a meeting held by teleconference shall be taken by roll call. Except for executive or closed meetings held by teleconference, there shall be provided one or more places at which the public may listen to and participate in the proceeding. Except for executive or closed meetings held by teleconference of related boards and commissions of the state, there shall be provided two or more places at which the public may listen to and participate in the proceeding. Except for the Rural Development Telecommunications Network, no teleconference may be used in conducting hearings or taking final disposition pursuant to \u00a7 1-26-4. Teleconference meetings are subject to the notice provisions of chapter 1-25. A violation of this section is a Class 2 misdemeanor. Section 5. That \u00a7 1-25-1.1 be amended to read as follows: 1-25-1.1. All public bodies shall provide public notice, with proposed agenda, at least twenty-four hours prior to any meeting, by posting a copy of the notice, visible to the public, at the principal office of the public body holding the meeting, and, for special or rescheduled meetings, delivering, in person, by mail or by telephone, the information in the notice to members of the local news media who have requested notice. For special or rescheduled meetings, all public bodies shall also comply with the public notice provisions of this section for regular meetings to the extent that circumstances permit. A violation of this section is a Class 2 misdemeanor. Section 6. That \u00a7 1-25-2 be amended to read as follows: 1-25-2. Executive or closed meetings may be held for the sole purposes of: (1) Discussing the qualifications, competence, performance, character, or fitness of any public officer or employee or prospective public officer or employee. The term \"employee\" does not include any independent contractor; (2) Discussing the expulsion, suspension, discipline, assignment of, or the educational program of a student; (3) Consulting with legal counsel or reviewing communications from legal counsel about proposed or pending litigation or contractual matters; (4) Preparing for contract negotiations or negotiating with employees or employee representatives; (5) Discussing marketing or pricing strategies by a board or commission of a business owned by the state or any of its political subdivisions, when public discussion may be harmful to the competitive position of the business. However, any official action concerning such matters shall be made at an open official meeting. An executive or closed meeting shall be held only upon a majority vote of the members of such body present and voting, and discussion during the closed meeting is restricted to the purpose specified in the closure motion. Nothing in \u00a7 1-25-1 or this section may be construed to prevent an executive or closed meeting if the federal or state Constitution or the federal or state statutes require or permit it. A violation of this section is a Class 2 misdemeanor."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 18140, "action_date": "2003-01-29T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 96047, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/96047.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 201, "committee_id_action": 798, "committee_id_assigned": 791, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 18140, "action_date": "2003-02-06T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 96702, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/96702.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 791, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 18140, "action_date": "2003-02-18T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 97296, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/97296.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass,", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 791, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "F", "vote": {"vote_id": 54668, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [2843, 2863, 2874, 2923, 2925], "Nay": [2875, 2888, 2906, 2907, 2902, 2873], "Excused": [2889, 2893]}}, {"bill_id": 18140, "action_date": "2003-02-18T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 97296, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/97296.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 791, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 18140, "action_date": "2003-02-20T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 97481, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/97481.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass,", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 791, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "F", "vote": {"vote_id": 54804, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [2843, 2875, 2888, 2889, 2906, 2907, 2902, 2873], "Yea": [2863, 2874, 2923, 2925], "Excused": [2893]}}, {"bill_id": 18140, "action_date": "2003-02-20T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 97481, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/97481.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to 41st legislative day", "journal_page": 497, "committee_id_action": 791, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 54805, "president_vote": null, "Not Voting": [2843], "Yea": [2863, 2874, 2875, 2888, 2889, 2906, 2907, 2902, 2873], "Excused": [2893], "Nay": [2923, 2925]}}, {"bill_id": 18140, "action_date": "2003-02-20T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 97481, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/97481.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 791, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 18140, "action_date": "2003-02-20T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 97546, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/97546.pdf", "status_text": "Recalled from committee (Rule 7-7)", "journal_page": 501, "committee_id_action": 798, "committee_id_assigned": 791, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 18140, "action_date": "2003-02-21T10:30:00-06:00", "document_id": 97590, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/97590.pdf", "status_text": "Do not Pass", "journal_page": 514, "committee_id_action": 791, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 54890, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [2843, 2863, 2874, 2875, 2888, 2889, 2893, 2906, 2907, 2902, 2873], "Nay": [2923, 2925]}}]}
