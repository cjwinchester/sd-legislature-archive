BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 25-5-7.1 be amended to read as follows: 25-5-7.1. In any custody dispute between parents, the court may order joint legal custody so that both parents retain full parental rights and responsibilities with respect to their child and so that both parents must confer on , and equally participate in, major decisions affecting the welfare of the child. In ordering joint legal custody, the court may consider the expressed desires of the parents and may grant to one party the ultimate responsibility over specific aspects of the child's welfare or may divide those aspects between the parties based on the best interest of the child. If it appears to the court to be in the best interest of the child, the court may order, or the parties may agree, how any such responsibility shall be divided. Such areas of responsibility may include the child's primary physical residence, child care, education, extracurricular activities, medical and dental care, religious instruction, the child's use of motor vehicles, and any other responsibilities which the court finds unique to a particular family or in the best interest of the child. Section 2. That chapter 25-5 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Each parent sharing joint legal custody of their child shall foster the other parent's relationship with the child."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 4863, "action_date": "2008-01-08T12:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 563, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/563.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 32, "committee_id_action": 27, "committee_id_assigned": 25, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 4863, "action_date": "2008-01-16T06:30:00-06:00", "document_id": 830, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/830.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 25, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 4863, "action_date": "2008-01-16T06:30:00-06:00", "document_id": 1204, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/1204.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 25, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "F", "vote": {"vote_id": 247, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [625, 575, 580, 628, 581, 554, 606, 561, 570], "Yea": [555, 568, 556, 587]}}, {"bill_id": 4863, "action_date": "2008-01-16T06:30:00-06:00", "document_id": 1204, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/1204.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to the 36th legislative day", "journal_page": 173, "committee_id_action": 25, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 248, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [625, 580, 628, 581, 554, 606, 561, 570], "Nay": [555, 568, 575, 556, 587]}}]}
