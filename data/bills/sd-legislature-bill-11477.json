During transportation, a transporter shall have the permit in the transporter's physical possession. The Department of Public Safety shall assess an industrial hemp transportation permit fee and the fee shall be deposited in the state highway fund. A transporter shall apply for an industrial hemp transportation permit on a form provided by the Department of Public Safety. The Department of Public Safety shall make available two types of an industrial hemp transportation permit. Grower licensees pursuant to \u00a7 38-35-3 may apply for the grower licensee transportation permit that shall be exclusively for the transportation of the grower licensee's industrial hemp from the land as described in the licensee's application to the storage location as described in the licensee's application. The grower licensee shall exercise dominion of control over the means of transportation and the storage location at all times. The grower licensee transportation permit is valid for the length of the grower license. During transportation pursuant to the grower licensee transportation permit, the transporter may only be the grower licensee, a key participant, or a person working under contract with or under the direction of the grower licensee. The transporter shall have in the transporter's physical possession a copy of the grower license under which the industrial hemp was grown or produced and a manifest that includes the following information about the industrial hemp being transported: the specific name and address of the transporter, the specific lot from which the hemp was harvested, the destination storage location for the hemp, and the type of vehicle being used. All other transporters shall obtain the general hemp transportation permit. During transportation pursuant to the general hemp transportation permit, the transporter shall have in the transporter's physical possession the following documentation: (1) A copy of the license under which the industrial hemp was grown or produced; (2) A laboratory report produced by a Drug Enforcement Administration-registered laboratory that confirms the lot of origin of all hemp being transported complies with 7 U.S.C. Chapter 38, Subchapter VII, as provided in 7 C.F.R 990.70(d) and 990.71(d) in effect as of January 1, 2020; (3) A signed affirmation from the licensee and the transporter that no illicit drugs or variations of hemp not explicitly authorized by 7 U.S.C. Chapter 38, Subchapter VII will be transported; and (4) A bill of lading or manifest that includes the shipment contents, the specific name and address of the transporter, the specific name and address of the origin and lot of origin, the destination of the shipment, the total weight of the load, and the type of vehicle being used. A transporter, applying for either type of permit, shall submit a permit form to the Department of Public Safety at least five business days before the trip. A transporter who falsifies any information contained on a permit form submitted to the Department of Public Safety shall be reported to the hemp program under which the industrial hemp being transported was grown, in addition to any other sanction or criminal charge allowed under this chapter or title 22. Failure to physically possess an appropriate permit and all proper documentation is probable cause to believe that the substance being transported is subject to the provisions of \u00a7 38-35-9 and is probable cause to believe that the transporter is subject to the provisions of chapter 22-42. No political subdivision, agency, law enforcement officer, or the state is liable for the seizure, spoilage, or destruction of any hemp shipment that does not meet the requirements of this chapter, regardless of whether the shipment is later established to be industrial hemp.

It is a Class 2 misdemeanor to transport industrial hemp, but not industrial hemp product, without appropriate documentation demonstrating compliance with an industrial hemp program of a federal, state, or tribal authority, in addition to any permit or documentation required by \u00a7 38-35-17. Section 17. That a NEW SECTION be added: 38-35-17. Transportation permit requirements--Two types of transportation permits--Required documentation. An industrial hemp transportation permit is required for any transporter traveling within or through the state. No person shall transport hemp in this state concurrently with any other plant material that is not hemp. During transportation, a transporter shall have the permit in the transporter's physical possession. The Department of Public Safety shall assess an industrial hemp transportation permit fee and the fee shall be deposited in the state highway fund. A transporter shall apply for an industrial hemp transportation permit on a form provided by the Department of Public Safety. The Department of Public Safety shall make available two types of an industrial hemp transportation permit.

The grower licensee shall exercise dominion of control over the means of transportation and the storage location at all times. The grower licensee transportation permit is valid for the length of the grower license. During transportation pursuant to the grower licensee transportation permit, the transporter may only be the grower licensee, a key participant, or a person working under contract with or under the direction of the grower licensee. The transporter shall have in the transporter's physical possession a copy of the grower license under which the industrial hemp was grown or produced and a manifest that includes the following information about the industrial hemp being transported: the specific name and address of the transporter, the specific lot from which the hemp was harvested, the destination storage location for the hemp, and the type of vehicle being used. All other transporters shall obtain the general hemp transportation permit. During transportation pursuant to the general hemp transportation permit, the transporter shall have in the transporter's physical possession the following documentation: (1) A copy of the license under which the industrial hemp was grown or produced; (2) A laboratory report produced by a Drug Enforcement Administration-registered laboratory that confirms the lot of origin of all hemp being transported complies with 7 U.S.C. Chapter 38, Subchapter VII, as provided in 7 C.F.R 990.70(d) and 990.71(d) in effect as of January 1, 2020; (3) A signed affirmation from the licensee and the transporter that no illicit drugs or variations of hemp not explicitly authorized by 7 U.S.C. Chapter 38, Subchapter VII will be transported; and (4) A bill of lading or manifest that includes the shipment contents, the specific name and address of the transporter, the specific name and address of the origin and lot of origin, the destination of the shipment, the total weight of the load, and the type of vehicle being used. A transporter, applying for either type of permit, shall submit a permit form to the Department of Public Safety at least five business days before the trip. A transporter who falsifies any information contained on a permit form submitted to the Department of Public Safety shall be reported to the hemp program under which the industrial hemp being transported was grown, in addition to any other sanction or criminal charge allowed under this chapter or title 22. Failure to physically possess an appropriate permit and all proper documentation is probable cause to believe that the substance being transported is subject to the provisions of \u00a7 38-35-9 and is probable cause to believe that the transporter is subject to the provisions of chapter 22-42. No political subdivision, agency, law enforcement officer, or the state is liable for the seizure, spoilage, or destruction of any hemp shipment that does not meet the requirements of this chapter, regardless of whether the shipment is later established to be industrial hemp.

Section 17. That a NEW SECTION be added: 38-35-17. Transportation permit requirements--Two types of transportation permits--Required documentation. An industrial hemp transportation permit is required for any transporter traveling within or through the state.

The grower licensee shall exercise dominion of control over the means of transportation and the storage location at all times. The grower licensee transportation permit is valid for the length of the grower license. During transportation pursuant to the grower licensee transportation permit, the transporter may only be the grower licensee, a key participant, or a person working under contract with or under the direction of the grower licensee. The transporter shall have in the transporter's physical possession a copy of the grower license under which the industrial hemp was grown or produced and a manifest that includes the following information about the industrial hemp being transported: the specific name and address of the transporter, the specific lot from which the hemp was harvested, the destination storage location for the hemp, and the type of vehicle being used. All other transporters shall obtain the general hemp transportation permit. During transportation pursuant to the general hemp transportation permit, the transporter shall have in the transporter's physical possession the following documentation: (1) A copy of the license under which the industrial hemp was grown or produced; (2) A laboratory report produced by a Drug Enforcement Administration-registered laboratory that confirms the lot of origin of all hemp being transported complies with 7 U.S.C. Chapter 38, Subchapter VII, as provided in 7 C.F.R 990.70(d) and 990.71(d) in effect as of January 1, 2020; (3) A signed affirmation from the licensee and the transporter that no illicit drugs or variations of hemp not explicitly authorized by 7 U.S.C. Chapter 38, Subchapter VII will be transported; and (4) A bill of lading or manifest that includes the shipment contents, the specific name and address of the transporter, the specific name and address of the origin and lot of origin, the destination of the shipment, the total weight of the load, and the type of vehicle being used. A transporter, applying for either type of permit, shall submit a permit form to the Department of Public Safety at least five business days before the trip. A transporter who falsifies any information contained on a permit form submitted to the Department of Public Safety shall be reported to the hemp program under which the industrial hemp being transported was grown, in addition to any other sanction or criminal charge allowed under this chapter or title 22. Failure to physically possess an appropriate permit and all proper documentation is probable cause to believe that the substance being transported is subject to the provisions of \u00a7 38-35-9 and is probable cause to believe that the transporter is subject to the provisions of chapter 22-42. No political subdivision, agency, law enforcement officer, or the state is liable for the seizure, spoilage, or destruction of any hemp shipment that does not meet the requirements of this chapter, regardless of whether the shipment is later established to be industrial hemp.

The attorney general shall annually collect and compile information, statistical and otherwise, which will, as far as practicable, present an accurate survey and may be useful in the study of the effect legalizing industrial hemp has had on controlled substance and marijuana prosecutions in this state, including the extent and character of alleged crimes not prosecuted or dismissed, the operations of police in drug investigations, the charging discretion of prosecuting attorneys, and the administration of criminal justice due to the legalization of industrial hemp. All information collected under this section shall be reported annually to the Governor and Legislature by December first each year. Section 20. That a NEW SECTION be added: 38-35-20. Coordination with other government entities. The department, Department of Health, and Department of Public Safety may provide to another state, local, tribal, or federal government entity, any specific licensee or permittee information as may be necessary to verify the legality or compliance of any licensee or permitee under this chapter. Application for, and receipt of, a license or permit under this chapter serves as the applicant's consent to provide information without prior notice or disclosure to the applicant that the information will be or has been shared. Section 21. That a NEW SECTION be added: 38-35-21. Industrial hemp for smoking prohibited--Violation as misdemeanor. The sale or use of industrial hemp for smoking or inhaling is prohibited.
