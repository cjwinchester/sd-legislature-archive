WHEREAS, research clearly indicates that, in addition to parents and peers, alcohol and tobacco advertising and marketing have a significant impact on youth decisions to drink; and WHEREAS, Prairie View Prevention in Sioux Falls cites that eight percent of all alcohol sold in South Dakota is consumed illegally by underage persons and that ninety percent of that alcohol is consumed through binge drinking; and WHEREAS, a national study published in January 2006 by the Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine concluded that greater exposure to alcohol advertising contributes to an increase in drinking among underage youth. Specifically, for each additional ad a young person saw, above the monthly youth average age of twenty-three, he or she drank one percent more. For each additional dollar per capita spent on alcohol advertising in a local market, above the national average of six dollars and eighty cents per capita, young people drank three percent more; and WHEREAS, researchers followed three thousand one hundred eleven students in South Dakota from seventh to ninth grade, and found that exposure to in-store beer displays in grade seven predicted onset of drinking by grade nine, and exposure to magazine advertising for alcohol and to beer concessions at sports or music events predicted frequency of drinking in grade nine; and WHEREAS, a USA Today survey found that teens report alcohol advertising has a greater influence on their desire to drink in general than on their desire to buy a particular brand of alcohol; and WHEREAS, according to a 2017 study by the Centers for Disease Control, exposure to marijuana advertisements was associated with higher odds of current marijuana use among adolescents. The study went on to say that \"regulations that limit marijuana advertisements to adolescents and educational campaigns on harmfulness of illicit marijuana use are needed\"; and WHEREAS, a poll done for an alcohol-industry-funded organization called the Century Council, found that seventy-three percent of the public believes that \"alcohol advertising is a major contributor to underage drinking\"; and WHEREAS, the National Association of Broadcasters recognizes the influence advertising can have on youth: \"The impact of advertising on radio and television audiences, particularly kids, cannot be overstated. Clever jingles, flashy lights, fast talking, and quick pacing, all contribute to the message of commercials.\"; and WHEREAS, underage persons are not a target market for tobacco, alcohol and other drug products since they are not of legal age to purchase, possess or consume these products: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the House of Representatives of the Ninety-Third Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the Senate concurring therein, that the South Dakota Legislature recognizes that tobacco, alcohol, and other drug advertising has no place in the lives of the children of the state of South Dakota."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 9093, "action_date": "2018-02-01T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 48515, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/48515.pdf", "status_text": "First Reading", "journal_page": 280, "committee_id_action": 396, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 9093, "action_date": "2018-02-02T13:30:00-06:00", "document_id": 48610, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/48610.pdf", "status_text": "Adopt Resolution", "journal_page": 311, "committee_id_action": 396, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 25285, "president_vote": null, "Excused": [1313, 1279, 1303, 1254], "Yea": [1241, 1213, 1269, 1297, 1424, 1268, 1284, 1214, 1266, 1223, 1307, 1301, 1235, 1294, 1425, 1282, 1260, 1311, 1308, 1312, 1275, 1283, 1238, 1250, 1286, 1314, 1222, 1302, 1306, 1265, 1315, 1247, 1316, 1296, 1292, 1248, 1293, 1310, 1226, 1280, 1263, 1274, 1295, 1249, 1277, 1309, 1259, 1255, 1299, 1225, 1256, 1261, 1240, 1258, 1305, 1287, 1257, 1236, 1215, 1317, 1216, 1229, 1298, 1285, 1253], "Nay": [1291]}}, {"bill_id": 9093, "action_date": "2018-02-05T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 48695, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/48695.pdf", "status_text": "First read and referred to", "journal_page": 366, "committee_id_action": 395, "committee_id_assigned": 369, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 9093, "action_date": "2018-02-13T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 48928, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/48928.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 369, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 9093, "action_date": "2018-02-13T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 49161, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/49161.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass", "journal_page": 445, "committee_id_action": 369, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 25714, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [1290, 1304, 1239, 1218, 1288, 1243, 1234]}}, {"bill_id": 9093, "action_date": "2018-02-14T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 49287, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/49287.pdf", "status_text": "Tabled", "journal_page": 462, "committee_id_action": 395, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 25833, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [1239, 1230, 1264, 1231, 1217, 1246, 1219, 1273, 1262, 1290, 1278, 1304, 1270, 1224, 1267, 1289, 1218, 1244, 1281, 1221, 1272, 1233, 1245, 1252, 1237, 1288, 1220, 1242, 1276, 1300], "Nay": [1228, 1234, 1243, 1271], "Excused": [1232]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/9093"}
