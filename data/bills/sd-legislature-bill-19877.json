BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. The Legislature finds that the practice of independent midwifery is a legitimate service to South Dakota families. Section 2. Any person who desires to offer services as a midwife shall first register with the Department of Health. The department shall prescribe a registration form for this purpose and may charge a registration fee of ten dollars. Section 3. Any person before rendering services as a midwife shall fully inform any prospective client of the midwife's background and experience, describe the type of care to be provided, and obtain the client's informed consent. Section 4. Nothing in this Act limits the right of any hospital to determine who shall have practice privileges in the facility. Section 5. No physician is liable for any care rendered by a midwife to a client if that client subsequently enters the care of a physician. 300 copies of this document were printed by the South Dakota Legislative Research Council at a cost of $.029 per page. .
