[and these] \"remain cause for celebration, but not for denigration of the members of either sex or for artificial constraints on an individual's opportunity.\" United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996); (6) In studies of large cohorts of children from 6 years old, \"[b]oys typically scored higher than girls on cardiovascular endurance, muscular strength, muscular endurance, and speed/agility, but lower on flexibility.\" Konstantinos Tambalis, et al., Physical fitness normative values for 6-18-year-old Greek boys and girls, using the empirical distribution and the lambda, mu, and sigma statistical method (2015) Eur J Sport Sci.

Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996); (12) One place where sex classifications allow for the full development of the talent and capacities of our Nation's people is in the context of sports and athletics; (13) Courts have recognized that the inherent, physiological differences between males and females result in different athletic capabilities and have stated that \"because of innate physiological differences, boys and girls are not similarly situated as they enter athletic competition . . . .\" Kleczek v. Rhode Island Interscholastic League, Inc., 612 A.2d 13 734, 738 (R.I. 1992); (14) The benefits that natural testosterone provides to male athletes is not diminished through the use of testosterone suppression. A recent study on the impact of such treatments found that policies like those of the International Olympic Committee requiring biological males to undergo at least one year of testosterone suppression before competing in women's sports do not create a level playing field. \"[T]he reduction in testosterone levels required by [policies like those of the International Olympic Committee] is insufficient to remove or reduce the male advantage, in terms of muscle mass and strength, by any meaningful degree.\" The study concluded that \"[t]he data presented here demonstrate that superior anthropometric, muscle mass and strength parameters achieved by males at puberty, and underpinning a consideration portion of the male performance advantage over females, are not removed by the current regimen of testosterone suppression\" permitted by the International Olympic Committee and other sports organizations. Rather, the study found that male performance advantage over females \"remains substantial.\" Emma Hilton, et al., Transgender Women in the Female Category of Sport: Perspectives on Testosterone Suppression and Performance Advantage, Sports Med (2020); and (15) Having separate sex-specific teams furthers the promotion of sex equality by providing opportunities for female athletes to demonstrate their skills, strengths, and athletic abilities, while also providing them with opportunities to obtain accolades, recognition, college scholarships, and numerous other long-term benefits associated with successful athletic endeavors.
