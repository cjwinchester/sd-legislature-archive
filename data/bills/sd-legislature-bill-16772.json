Section 14. Notwithstanding \u00a7 9-19-13, any new ordinance or amendment to an ordinance enacted under the authority of this Act, and any tax rate affected thereby, can be effective only on January first or July first of a calendar year. The ordinance or amendment shall be effective on the earlier of January first or July first following at least ninety days notification by the municipality to the secretary of revenue that the ordinance or amendment has been enacted unless the ordinance or amendment is suspended by operation of a referendum.

Section 16. Any municipality imposing a tax pursuant to this Act may issue municipal non-ad valorem tax revenue bonds pursuant to this section and chapter 6-8B in anticipation of the collection of the taxes. The bonds shall be payable solely from the collections of the taxes imposed by the municipality under this Act, as determined by the governing body. The governing body shall, in the resolution or ordinance authorizing the bonds, agree that it will continue to impose and collect the taxes so long as the bonds are outstanding. The governing body shall also pledge so much of the collections of the taxes as may be necessary to pay the principal premium and interest on the bonds and to maintain any debt service reserve established for the bonds. The proceeds of the bonds may be used for land acquisition, the funding of public ambulances and medical emergency response vehicles, public hospitals or nonprofit hospitals with fifty or fewer licensed beds and other public health care facilities or nonprofit health care facilities with fifty or fewer licensed beds, capital asset acquisition and capital improvements, to establish a debt service reserve fund for the bonds and to pay not more than one year's capitalized interest on the bonds. If the proceeds of the tax imposed by this Act are pledged to payment of the bonds, the land acquisition and capital improvements financed with the proceeds of the bonds shall relate to the purposes enumerated in section 2 of this Act. No election is required to authorize the issuance of municipal non-ad valorem tax revenue bonds. The bonds shall be issued and sold as provided in chapter 6-8B. Section 17. The Legislature hereby finds that the amendments to chapter 10-52 contained in this Act shall result in a broader and more uniform tax base for the tax levied by municipalities under this chapter, and that, absent a reduction in the current tax levy of a municipality, it is anticipated that total tax revenues of a municipality may increase as a result of these amendments. However, so long as a municipality has any bonds or other obligations outstanding which are secured directly or indirectly by the pledge or collection and application of taxes levied pursuant to \u00a7 10-52-8 as in effect immediately prior to the effective date of this Act, no municipality may reduce its tax levy under this Act to a rate which, in the exercise of the sound discretion of the governing body, would be expected to produce less total revenue than was collected in the immediately preceding year pursuant to the tax imposed under \u00a7 10-52-8."}, {"bill_id": 16772,
