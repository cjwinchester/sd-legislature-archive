Section 9. That \u00a7 13-49-25 be repealed. 13-49-25.

Section 12. That \u00a7 13-49-28 be repealed. 13-49-28. The board will develop and recommend to the secretary standards consistent with subdivision 13-49-27(4) to insure that postsecondary institutions have the ability to provide education and training at levels that are consistent with their representations to their students. These standards for program review shall be developed in consultation with the postsecondary institutions of the state. The process of development and consultation is not subject to chapter 1-26, but the board may develop such standards only after a duly noticed public hearing. The standards for program review do not operate as rules of general applicability as defined in chapter 1-26; but, before the board takes final action to enforce such standards, it shall provide an institution with an opportunity for a contested case hearing as provided for in chapter 1-26. Section 13. That \u00a7 13-49-29 be repealed. 13-49-29. Postsecondary institutions shall receive a hearing, upon reasonable notice, to determine whether to notify the secretary pursuant to subdivision 13-49-27(6). In reaching that determination, the board may consider the data gathered in the review process, evaluations obtained from accrediting agencies or other peer review systems or any other relevant evidence, together with any responses, explanations, or arguments from the postsecondary institutions under review.

Section 18. That \u00a7 13-55-14.3 be repealed. 13-55-14.3. Each applicant shall: complete and file an application for a scholarship; be responsible for providing the information required to determine financial need; and report promptly to the executive director any information requested which is necessary to make a proper determination with respect to the student's application. Section 19. That \u00a7 13-55-20 be repealed. 13-55-20. In the event a student leaves school, any unused portion of the scholarship for which a student is entitled to, a refund shall revert to the state Indian scholarship fund. Section 20. That \u00a7 13-55F-1 be repealed. 13-55F-1. There is established the Mickelson Scholars Program to be administered by the Board of Regents, which is hereby authorized to establish such policies and procedures as it deems necessary to carry out the purposes of this program. However, the Board of Regents may not award any Mickelson scholarships to any student who graduates from high school after Spring 1995. The purpose of the program is to encourage South Dakota's most academically accomplished high school graduates to remain in the state and to contribute to the economic development of the state. Section 21. That \u00a7 13-55F-2 be repealed. 13-55F-2. In order to be eligible for a Mickelson Scholars Award, a student shall: (1) Be a resident of South Dakota at the time of graduation from high school; (2) Meet the admissions requirements and attend one of the six Board of Regents universities or four state technical institutes; (3) Have obtained a high school cumulative grade point average of at least 3.0 on a 4.0 scale, or the equivalent, through the junior year of high school; and (4) Be considered academically to be in the top one percent of the state's high school graduating class. The determination of qualifications for the top one percent of high school graduates in the state shall be announced each year by the board. Section 22. That \u00a7 13-55F-3 be repealed. 13-55F-3. To receive a Mickelson Scholarship a student shall attend a Board of Regents university or a state technical institute. Scholarship payments shall be made on a semester by semester basis with the scholarship amount equal to the student's costs for tuition, required fees and special discipline fees, and room and board, subject to the estimated cost of attendance limitation described in this section. In no case may expenses for board exceed reasonable amounts for three meals a day. If a student lives off-campus, not with parents, the award amount for room shall be equal to the double-occupancy residence hall rate, and the amount for board shall be equal to the most comprehensive basic, nonoptional meal plan available on campus. If a student lives with parents, the student shall receive five hundred dollars each semester for room and board and commuting expenses. The award amount available under this scholarship program is subject to a maximum limitation, so that the total funding from the Mickelson Scholars Program and all federal need-based gift aid may not exceed the student's estimated cost of attendance. Mickelson scholarships shall be paid to the recipients through their campus after the final fee adjustment date and when the other need-based grants and scholarships are known. Section 23. That \u00a7 13-55F-4 be repealed. 13-55F-4. A student is eligible to participate in the Mickelson Scholars Program for the equivalent of four academic years or until the attainment of a baccalaureate degree, whichever comes first. The student shall maintain a cumulative 3.0 grade point average on a 4.0 scale to retain eligibility for the program. Cumulative grade point average shall be calculated after the second semester and every semester thereafter. The student shall complete consecutive spring and fall terms in order to remain eligible for continuation of the scholarship program from term to term. Once a student's cumulative grade point average falls below 3.0 on a 4.0 scale, the student permanently loses eligibility for continuation in the scholarship program. If the executive director of the Board of Regents determines that a student's failure to enroll or to maintain continued enrollment has resulted from legitimate factors outside the student's control, or has resulted from the student's participation in an activity that in the executive director's judgment provides knowledge or experience that will enhance the student's academic pursuits, the executive director may extend the student's eligibility to participate in the program for up to two additional years, provided that the student does not enroll in a noneligible institution, except under an exchange agreement. If approved by the executive director, the Mickelson Scholarship Program may provide a scholarship award for the exchange equal to the previous year's award for that student. Extended eligibility does not entitle a student to receive a Mickelson Scholars Award for more than the equivalent of four academic years. A student may also maintain eligibility for continuation in the Mickelson Scholars Program by notifying the executive director of the student's intent to transfer to another of the ten eligible institutions. Section 24. That \u00a7 13-56B-1.1 be repealed. 13-56B-1.1. Any student at the University of South Dakota School of Medicine who has participated in the tuition waiver program as provided in chapter 13-56B prior to July 1, 1982, but after July 1, 1979, shall be allowed to fulfill his service requirement as provided in chapter 13-56B which was in effect on January 1, 1982. The amount of service time required shall be prorated by the Board of Regents based on the number of years of participation in the waiver program. Section 25. That \u00a7 13-56B-4 be repealed. 13-56B-4. In addition to students attending the medical school under the provisions of \u00a7 13- 56B-8, the Board of Regents shall authorize the attendance at the South Dakota School of Medicine of persons who have agreed to practice for a definite period of time in the United States Public Health Service or in a critical health manpower shortage area as may be required by federal law. Such persons shall pay tuition for their medical education as determined by the Board of Regents. Section 26. That \u00a7 13-56B-6 be repealed. 13-56B-6. If any student who is studying or any doctor who has graduated under the provisions of this chapter is inducted into the armed forces of the United States, any duty or obligation imposed upon him pursuant to this chapter shall be stayed for the term of his active duty enlistment. Section 27. That \u00a7 13-56B-6.2 be repealed. 13-56B-6.2. The Board of Regents may stay any duty or obligation imposed upon a student pursuant to this chapter for a maximum period of two years if it determines that a temporary disability or extreme hardship will cause a temporary delay in the student's completion of his obligations under this chapter. Section 28. That \u00a7 13-56B-8 be repealed. 13-56B-8. The Board of Regents shall also make provision, authorizing attendance at the South Dakota School of Medicine, for persons not desiring to participate in the medical profession scholarship program. Such persons shall pay tuition as determined by the Board of Regents. Section 29. That \u00a7 13-56B-9 be repealed. 13-56B-9. The Board of Regents shall adopt rules, in accordance with the provisions of chapter 1-26, to carry out the provisions of this chapter. Section 30. That \u00a7 13-58-4 be repealed. 13-58-4. Students over sixteen years of age who study agriculture at the South Dakota State University shall be taught to apply the tuberculin test so as to be able to test cattle for the disease known as tuberculosis. Section 31. That \u00a7 13-58-6 be repealed. 13-58-6.

Such easements shall be executed by the president and secretary of the Board of Regents. Section 32. That \u00a7 13-58-26 be repealed. 13-58-26. The University Co-op Child Learning Center, Inc., a nonprofit corporation organized under the laws of the State of South Dakota, may construct and equip, on the campus of South Dakota State University, a day care facility for the children of students and staff of South Dakota State University. Section 33. That \u00a7 13-58-27 be repealed. 13-58-27.

Nothing in \u00a7\u00a7 13-58-26 to 13-58-31, inclusive, may be construed as authorization for the Board of Regents to incur any state indebtedness or financing liability. Section 34. That \u00a7 13-58-28 be repealed. 13-58-28. The Board of Regents may determine the appropriate site for the purposes of \u00a7 13- 58-26 and may lease that site to the University Co-op Child Learning Center, Inc. Section 35.

The board may also enter into agreements to ensure that the facility is used only as a child day care facility. Section 36. That \u00a7 13-58-30 be repealed. 13-58-30.
