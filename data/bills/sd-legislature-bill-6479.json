The notice shall inform the employer of the amount to be assigned to the office. Upon receipt of such notice of administrative wage assignment, the employer shall withhold from compensation due, or to become due to the employee, the total amount shown by the notice.

Section 28. The employer may assess a one-time fee against the debtor, not to exceed twenty-five dollars, for forwarding of moneys to the office, for each notice received by the employer pursuant to section 26 of this Act. This fee is in addition to the amount owed to or being collected by the office from the debtor. If insufficient funds are available from the debtor's compensation to cover the fee and the amount in the notice of administrative wage assignment, the employer may deduct the fee amount prior to forwarding moneys to the office. Section 29. Challenges to an administrative wage assignment may be initiated only by a debtor. Any review by the office of a challenge to an administrative wage assignment is not subject to chapter 1-26. Section 30.

Upon receipt of the notice from the office, the employer shall release the funds in excess of the revised amount and forward the revised amount to the office pursuant to the administrative wage assignment; and (3) Any money received by the office in excess of the amount to be collected by the office shall be returned to the debtor. Section 33. If the office finds no mistake of fact, the office shall send a notice to that effect to the debtor by regular mail, by electronic means, or by delivery by an employee of the office, and notify the employer to forward the moneys pursuant to the administrative wage assignment. Section 34. The debtor may file an action for wrongful assignment in circuit court within thirty days of the date of the notice sent to a debtor pursuant to subdivision (2) of section 32 of this Act or section 33 of this Act, either in the county where the debtor is located or in Hughes County where the office is located. Actions under this section are in equity and not actions at law. Recovery under this section is limited to restitution of the amount that has been wrongfully encumbered or obtained by the office.

Only issues involving the assignment may be raised in a challenge to an action under this section. Section 35. A notice of administrative wage assignment given to the debtor is effective without the service of another notice until the debt, plus the cost recovery fee being collected by the office is paid in full or the debtor receives notice from the office that the administrative wage assignment shall cease. Cessation of the administrative wage assignment does not affect the debtor's duties and liabilities respecting the wages, income or compensation already withheld pursuant to the administrative wage assignment. Section 36. The office may establish and maintain a financial institution data match system for the purpose of identifying and seizing the non-exempt assets of debtors as identified by the office. The office may designate a third party to establish and maintain this system.
