The court's final decision may be appealed as in other civil proceedings. Section 8.

A certificate of existence or authorization shall set forth: (a) The domestic nonprofit corporation's corporate name or the foreign nonprofit corporation's corporate name used in this state; (b) That the domestic nonprofit corporation is duly incorporated under the law of this state, the date of its incorporation, and the period of its duration if less than perpetual; or that the foreign nonprofit corporation is authorized to conduct activities in this state; (c) That all fees, taxes, and penalties owed to this state have been paid, if: (1) Payment is reflected in the records of the Office of the Secretary of State; and (2) Nonpayment affects the existence or authorization of the domestic or foreign nonprofit corporation; (d) That its most recent annual report has been delivered to the Office of the Secretary of State; (e) That articles of dissolution have not been filed; and (f) Other facts of record in the Office of the Secretary of State that may be requested by the applicant.

Section 10. No person may sign a document, paper form or electronically, knowing it is false in any material respect with intent that the document be delivered to the Office of the Secretary of State for filing.

(b) The court may determine the right to vote at the meeting of persons claiming that right, may appoint an individual to hold the meeting under such orders and powers as the court may deem proper, and may take such action as may be required to give due notice of the meeting and convene and conduct the meeting in the interests of justice. Section 16.

(a) Except as otherwise restricted by the articles of incorporation or bylaws, any action that may be taken at any annual, regular, or special meeting of members may be taken without a meeting if the membership corporation delivers a ballot to every member entitled to vote on the matter. (b) A ballot must: (1) Be in the form of a record; (2) Set forth each proposed action; (3) Provide an opportunity to vote for, or withhold a vote for, each candidate for election as a director; and (4) Provide an opportunity to vote for or against each other proposed action. (c) Approval by ballot pursuant to this section of action other than election of directors is valid only when the number of votes cast by ballot equals or exceeds the quorum required to be present at a meeting authorizing the action, and the number of approvals equals or exceeds the number of votes that would be required to approve the matter at a meeting at which the total number of votes cast was the same as the number of votes cast by ballot. (d) All solicitations for votes by ballot must: (1) Indicate the number of responses needed to meet the quorum requirements; (2) State the percentage of approvals necessary to approve each matter other than election of directors; and (3) Specify the time by which a ballot must be received by the membership corporation in order to be counted. (e) Except as otherwise provided in the articles of incorporation or bylaws, a ballot may not be revoked. Section 59. (a) After fixing a record date for a meeting, a membership corporation shall prepare an alphabetical list of the names of all its members who are entitled to notice of that meeting of the members. The list must show the address of and number of votes each member is entitled to cast at the meeting. (b) The list of members must be available for inspection by any member, beginning two business days after notice of the meeting is given for which the list was prepared and continuing through the meeting, at the membership corporation's principal office or at a place identified in the meeting notice in the city where the meeting will be held. A member or the member's agent is entitled on demand in the form of a record to inspect and, subject to the requirements of section 201(c) of this Act, to copy the list, during regular business hours and at the member's expense, during the period it is available for inspection. (c) The membership corporation must make the list of members available at the meeting, and a member or the member's agent is entitled to inspect the list at any time during the meeting or any adjournment. (d) If a membership corporation refuses to allow a member or the member's agent to inspect the list of members before or at the meeting, or copy the list as permitted by subsection (b), the circuit court of the county where the corporation's principal office or, if none in this state, its registered office, is located, on application of the member, may: (1) Summarily order the inspection or copying at the corporation's expense; (2) Postpone the meeting for which the list was prepared until the inspection or copying is complete; (3) Order the corporation to pay the member's costs, including reasonable counsel fees, incurred to obtain the order; and (4) Order other appropriate relief. (e) Refusal or failure to prepare or make available the list of members does not affect the validity of action taken at the meeting. (f) Instead of making the list of members available as provided in subsection (b), a membership corporation may state in a notice of meeting that the corporation has elected to proceed pursuant to this subsection. A member of a corporation elects to proceed pursuant to this subsection must state in the member's demand for inspection a proper purpose for which inspection is demanded. Within ten business days after receiving a demand pursuant to this subsection, the corporation must deliver to the member making the demand an offer of a reasonable alternative method of achieving the purpose identified in the demand without providing access to or a copy of the list of members. An alternative method that reasonably and in a timely manner accomplishes the proper purpose set forth in the demand relieves the corporation from making the list of members available pursuant to subsection (b), unless within a reasonable time after acceptance of the offer the corporation fails to do the things it offered to do. Any rejection of the corporation's offer must be in the form of a record and must indicate the reasons the alternative proposed by the corporation does not meet the proper purpose of the demand. Section 60. Except as provided in the articles of incorporation or bylaws, each member is entitled to one vote on each matter voted on by the members. Section 61. (a) Except as otherwise provided in the articles of incorporation or bylaws, a member may vote in person or by proxy. (b) A member or the member's agent or attorney-in-fact may appoint a proxy to vote or otherwise act for the member by signing an appointment form in the form of a record. An appointment form must contain or be accompanied by information from which it can be determined that the member or the member's agent or attorney-in-fact authorized the appointment of the proxy. (c) An appointment of a proxy is effective when a signed appointment in the form of a record is received by the inspectors of election, the officer or agent of the membership corporation authorized to tabulate votes, or the secretary. An appointment is valid for eleven months unless a longer period, which may not exceed three years, is expressly provided in the appointment form. (d) The death or incapacity of the member appointing a proxy does not affect the right of the membership corporation to accept the proxy's authority unless notice of the death or incapacity is received by the inspectors of election, the officer or agent authorized to tabulate votes, or the secretary before the proxy exercises his authority under the appointment. (e) Subject to section 62 of this Act and to any express limitation on the proxy's authority stated in the appointment form, a membership corporation is entitled to accept the proxy's vote or other action as that of the member making the appointment. Section 62. (a) If the name signed on a ballot, consent, waiver, or proxy appointment corresponds to the name of a member, the membership corporation if acting in good faith is entitled to accept the ballot, consent, waiver, or proxy appointment and give it effect as the act of the member. (b) If the name signed on a ballot, consent, waiver, or proxy appointment does not correspond to the name of its member, the membership corporation if acting in good faith is nevertheless entitled to accept the ballot, consent, waiver, or proxy appointment and give it effect as the act of the member if: (1) The member is an entity and the name signed purports to be that of an officer or agent of the entity; (2) The name signed purports to be that of an administrator, executor, guardian, or conservator representing the member and, if the corporation requests, evidence of fiduciary status acceptable to the corporation has been presented with respect to the ballot, consent, waiver, or proxy appointment; (3) The name signed purports to be that of a receiver or trustee in bankruptcy of the member and, if the corporation requests, evidence of this status acceptable to the corporation has been presented with respect to the ballot, consent, waiver, or proxy appointment; (4) The name signed purports to be that of a beneficial owner or attorney-in-fact of the member and, if the corporation requests, evidence acceptable to the corporation of the signatory's authority to sign for the member has been presented with respect to the ballot, consent, waiver, or proxy appointment; (5) Two or more persons are the member as co-tenants or fiduciaries and the name signed purports to be the name of at least one of the co-owners and the person signing appears to be acting on behalf of all the co-owners. (c) The membership corporation is entitled to reject a ballot, consent, waiver, or proxy appointment if the secretary or other officer or agent authorized to tabulate votes, acting in good faith, has reasonable basis for doubt about the validity of the signature on it or about the signatory's authority to sign for the member. (d) The membership corporation and its officer or agent who accepts or rejects a ballot, consent, waiver, or proxy appointment in good faith and in accordance with the standards of this section or section 61(b) of this Act are not liable in damages to the member for the consequences of the acceptance or rejection. (e) Corporate action based on the acceptance or rejection of a ballot, consent, waiver, or proxy appointment under this section is valid unless a court of competent jurisdiction determines otherwise. Section 63. (a) Members entitled to vote as a separate voting group may take action on a matter at a meeting only if one-tenth of the members exist with respect to that matter. Except as provided in the articles of incorporation or bylaws, a majority of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter by the voting group constitutes a quorum of that voting group for action on that matter. (b) Once a member is represented for any purpose at a meeting, the member is deemed present for quorum purposes for the remainder of the meeting and for any adjournment of that meeting unless a new record date is or must be set for that adjourned meeting. (c) If a quorum exists, action on a matter, other than the election of directors, by a voting group is approved if the votes cast within the voting group favoring the action exceed the votes cast opposing the action, unless the articles of incorporation or bylaws require a greater number of affirmative votes. (d) An amendment of the articles of incorporation or bylaws adding, changing, or deleting a quorum or voting requirement for a voting group greater than specified in subsection (a) or (c) is governed by section 65 of this Act. (e) If a meeting cannot be organized because a quorum is not present, those members present may adjourn the meeting to such time and place as they may determine. Except as provided in the articles of incorporation or bylaws, when a meeting that has been adjourned for lack of a quorum is reconvened, those members present, although less than a quorum as fixed in this section, the articles, or the bylaws, nonetheless constitute a quorum. (f) The election of directors is governed by section 66 of this Act Section 64. (a) If this Act, the articles of incorporation, or the bylaws provide for voting by a single voting group on a matter, action on that matter is taken when voted upon by that voting group pursuant to section 63 of this Act. (b) If this Act, the articles of incorporation, or the bylaws provide for voting by two or more voting groups on a matter, action on that matter is taken only when voted upon by each of those voting groups counted separately as provided in section 63 of this Act. Section 65. (a) The articles of incorporation or bylaws may provide for a higher or lower quorum or voting requirement for members, or voting groups of members, than is provided for by this Act. (b) An amendment to the articles of incorporation or bylaws that adds, changes, or deletes a greater quorum or voting requirement must meet the same quorum requirement and be adopted by the same vote and voting groups required to take action under the quorum and voting requirements then in effect. Section 66. (a) Except as provided in the articles of incorporation or bylaws, directors of a membership corporation are elected by a plurality of the votes cast by the members entitled to vote in the election at a meeting at which a quorum is present. (b) Members do not have a right to cumulate their votes for directors. Section 67. (a) A membership corporation may appoint one or more inspectors to act at a meeting of members and make a report in the form of a record of the inspectors' determinations. Each inspector shall execute the duties of inspector impartially and according to the best of the inspector's ability. (b) The inspectors shall: (1) Ascertain the number of members and their voting power; (2) Determine the members present at a meeting; (3) Determine the validity of proxies and ballots; (4) Count all votes; and (5) Determine the result. (c) An inspector may, but need not, be a director, member of a designated body, member, officer, or employee of the membership corporation. A person who is a candidate for office to be filled at the meeting may not be an inspector. Section 68. (a) Two or more members may provide for the manner in which they will vote by signing an agreement in the form of a record for that purpose. A voting agreement may be valid for a period of up to ten years. (b) A voting agreement created pursuant to this section is specifically enforceable, except that a voting agreement is not enforceable to the extent that enforcement of the agreement would violate the purposes of the membership corporation. Section 69. (a) A nonprofit corporation must have a board of directors. (b) Except as provided in section 80 of this Act, all corporate powers must be exercised by or under the authority of the board of directors of the nonprofit corporation, and the activities and affairs of the corporation must be managed by or under the direction, and subject to the oversight, of its board of directors. Section 70. A director of a nonprofit corporation must be an individual. The articles of incorporation or bylaws may prescribe other qualifications for directors. A director need not be a resident of this state or a member of the corporation unless the articles or bylaws so prescribe. Section 71. (a) A board of directors must consist of three or more directors, with the number specified in or fixed in accordance with the articles of incorporation or bylaws. (b) The number of directors may be increased or decreased, but to no fewer than three, from time to time by amendment to, or in the manner provided in, the articles of incorporation or bylaws. Section 72. (a) The directors of a membership corporation, other than any initial directors named in the articles of incorporation or elected by the incorporators, shall be elected at the first annual meeting of members, and at each annual meeting thereafter, unless the articles or bylaws provide some other time or method of election, or provide that some or all of the directors are appointed by some other person or designated in some other manner. (b) The directors of a nonmembership corporation, other than any initial directors named in the articles of incorporation or elected by the incorporators, shall be elected, appointed, or designated as provided in the articles or bylaws. If no method of designation or appointment is set forth in the articles or bylaws, the directors, other than any initial directors, shall be elected by the board. Section 73. (a) The articles of incorporation or bylaws may specify the terms of directors. If a term is not specified in the articles or bylaws, the term of a director is one year. Except for directors who are appointed by persons who are not members or who are designated in a manner other than by election or appointment, the term of a director may not exceed twelve years. (b) A decrease in the number of directors or term of office does not shorten an incumbent director's term. (c) Except as provided in the articles of incorporation or bylaws, the term of a director elected to fill a vacancy expires at the end of the unexpired term that the director is filling. (d) Despite the expiration of a director's term, the director continues to serve until the director's successor is elected, appointed, or designated and until the director's successor takes office unless otherwise provided in the articles of incorporation or bylaws. Section 74. The articles of incorporation or bylaws may provide for staggering the terms of directors by dividing the total number of directors into groups of one or more directors. The terms of office and number of directors in each group do not need to be uniform. Section 75. (a) A director may resign at any time by delivering a signed notice in the form of a record to the chair of the board of directors or to an executive officer or the secretary of the corporation. (b) A resignation is effective when the notice is delivered unless the notice specifies a later effective time. Section 76. (a) Removal of directors of a membership corporation is subject to the following provisions: (1) The members may remove, with or without cause, one or more directors who have been elected by the members, unless the articles of incorporation or bylaws provide that directors may be removed only for cause. The articles or bylaws may specify what constitutes cause for removal. See section 145(a) of this Act, bylaw amendments requiring member approval; (2) Except as provided in the articles of incorporation or bylaws, if a director is elected by a voting group of members, or by a chapter or other organizational unit, or by a region or other geographic grouping, only the members of that voting group or chapter, unit, region, or grouping may participate in the vote to remove the director; (3) The notice of a meeting of members at which removal of a director is to be considered must state that the purpose, or one of the purposes, of the meeting is removal of the director; (4) The board of directors of a membership corporation may not remove a director except as provided in subsection (c) or in the articles of incorporation or bylaws.

(c) The board of directors of a membership corporation or nonmembership corporation may remove a director who: (1) Has been declared of unsound mind by a final order of court; (2) Has been convicted of a felony; (3) Has been found by a final order of court to have breached a duty as a director under sections 87 to 89, inclusive, of this Act; (4) Has missed the number of board meetings specified in the articles of incorporation or bylaws, if the articles or bylaws at the beginning of the director's current term provided that a director may be removed for missing the specified number of board meetings; or (5) Does not satisfy at the time any of the qualifications for directors set forth in the articles of incorporation or bylaws at the beginning of the director's current term, if the decision that the director fails to satisfy a qualification is made by the vote of a majority of the directors who meet all of the required qualifications. (d) A director who is designated in the articles of incorporation or bylaws may be removed by an amendment to the articles or bylaws deleting or changing the designation. See section 147 of this Act, approval of amendments by third persons. (e) Except as provided in the articles of incorporation or bylaws, a director who is appointed by persons other than the members may be removed with or without cause by those persons. Section 77. (a) The circuit court of the county where the principal office of a nonprofit corporation is located, or, if none in this state, in Hughes County, may remove a director from office in a proceeding commenced by or in the right of the corporation if the court finds that: (1) The director engaged in fraudulent conduct with respect to the corporation or its members, grossly abused the position of director, or intentionally inflicted harm on the corporation; and (2) Considering the director's course of conduct and the inadequacy of other available remedies, removal would be in the best interest of the corporation. (b) A member, individual director, or member of a designated body proceeding on behalf of the nonprofit corporation under subsection (a) shall comply with all of the requirements of sections 156 to 158, inclusive, of this Act.

Section 78. (a) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b), the articles of incorporation, or the bylaws, if a vacancy occurs on the board of directors, including a vacancy resulting from an increase in the number of directors, the vacancy may be filled by a majority of the directors remaining in office even if they constitute less than a quorum. (b) Except as provided in the articles of incorporation or bylaws, a vacancy in the position of a director who is: (1) Elected by a voting group of members, by a chapter or other organizational unit of members, or by a region or other geographic grouping of members, may be filled during the first three months after the vacancy occurs only by that voting group or chapter, unit, region, or grouping; (2) Appointed by persons other than the members, may be filled only by those persons; or (3) Designated in the articles of incorporation or bylaws may not be filled by action of the board of directors. (c) A vacancy that will occur at a specific later time by reason of a resignation effective at a later time pursuant to section 75(b) of this Act, or otherwise, may be filled before the vacancy occurs but the new director may not take office until the vacancy occurs. Section 79. Unless the articles of incorporation or bylaws provide otherwise, the board of directors may fix the compensation of directors. Section 80. (a) Some, but less than all, of the powers, authority or functions of the board of directors of a nonprofit corporation under this Act may be vested by the articles of incorporation or bylaws in a designated body. If such a designated body is created: (1) The provisions of this Act and other provisions of law on the rights, duties, and liabilities of the board of directors or directors individually also apply to the designated body and to the members of the designated body individually. The provisions of this Act and other provisions of law on meetings, notice, and the manner of acting of the board of directors also apply to the designated body in the absence of an applicable rule in the articles of incorporation, bylaws or internal operating rules of the designated body; (2) To the extent the powers, authority, or functions of the board of directors have been vested in the designated body, the directors are relieved from their duties and liabilities with respect to those powers, authority, and functions; (3) A provision of the articles of incorporation regarding indemnification of directors or limiting the liability of directors adopted pursuant to section 21(b)(8) or (c) of this Act applies to members of the designated body, except as otherwise provided in the articles. (b) Some, but less than all, of the rights or obligations of the members of a nonprofit corporation under this Act may be vested by the articles of incorporation or bylaws in a designated body. If such a designated body is created: (1) The provisions of sections 69 to 111, inclusive, of this Act, and other provisions of law on the rights and obligations of members also apply to the designated body and to the members of the designated body individually. The provisions of this Act and other provisions of law on meetings, notice, and the manner of acting of members also apply to the designated body in the absence of an applicable provision in the articles of incorporation, bylaws or internal operating rules of the designated body; (2) To the extent the rights or obligations of the members are vested in the designated body, the members are relieved from responsibility with respect to those rights and obligations. (c) The articles of incorporation or bylaws may prescribe qualifications for members of a designated body. Except as otherwise provided by the articles or bylaws, a member of a designated body does not need to be: (1) An individual; (2) A director, officer, or member of the nonprofit corporation; or (3) A resident of this state. (d) See section 145(a) of this Act, bylaw amendments requiring member approval. Section 81. (a) The board of directors may hold regular or special meetings in or out of this state. (b) Unless the articles of incorporation or bylaws provide otherwise, the board of directors may permit any or all directors to participate in a regular or special meeting by, or conduct the meeting through the use of, any means of communication by which all directors participating may simultaneously hear each other during the meeting. A director participating in a meeting by this means is considered to be present in person at the meeting. Section 82. (a) Except to the extent that the articles of incorporation or bylaws require that action by the board of directors be taken at a meeting, action required or permitted pursuant to this Act to be taken by the board of directors may be taken without a meeting if each director signs a consent in the form of a record describing the action to be taken and delivers it to the nonprofit corporation. (b) Action taken pursuant to this section is the act of the board of directors when one or more consents signed by all the directors are delivered to the nonprofit corporation. The consent may specify the time at which the action taken in the consent is to be effective. A director's consent may be withdrawn by a revocation in the form of a record signed by the director and delivered to the corporation prior to delivery to the corporation of unrevoked consents signed by all the directors. (c) A consent signed pursuant to this section has the effect of action taken at a meeting of the board of directors and may be described as such in any document. Section 83. (a) Unless the articles of incorporation or bylaws provide otherwise, or as otherwise required by law, regular meetings of the board of directors may be held without notice of the date, time, place, or purpose of the meeting. (b) Unless the articles of incorporation or bylaws provide for a longer or shorter period, special meetings of the board of directors must be preceded by at least two days' notice of the date, time, and place of the meeting. The notice need not describe the purpose of the special meeting unless required by the articles of incorporation or bylaws. (c) Unless the articles of incorporation or bylaws provide otherwise, the chair of the board, the highest ranking officer of the corporation, or twenty percent of the directors then in office may call and give notice of a meeting of the board of directors.

Except as provided by subsection (b), the waiver must be in the form of a record, signed by the director entitled to the notice, and filed with the minutes or corporate records. (b) A director's attendance at or participation in a meeting waives any required notice to the director of the meeting, unless the director at the beginning of the meeting, or promptly upon arrival, objects to holding the meeting or transacting business at the meeting and does not thereafter vote for or assent to action taken at the meeting. Section 85. (a) Except as provided in subsection (b), the articles of incorporation, or the bylaws, a quorum of the board of directors consists of a majority of the directors in office before a meeting begins. (b) The articles of incorporation or bylaws may authorize a quorum of the board of directors to consist of no fewer than the greater of one-third of the number of directors in office or two directors. (c) If a quorum is present when a vote is taken, the affirmative vote of a majority of directors present is the act of the board of directors unless a greater vote is required by the articles of incorporation or bylaws. (d) A director who is present at a meeting of the board of directors when corporate action is taken is considered to have assented to the action taken unless one of the following applies: (1) The director objects at the beginning of the meeting, or promptly upon arrival, to holding it or transacting business at the meeting; (2) The director dissents or abstains from the action and: (i) The dissent or abstention is entered in the minutes of the meeting; or (ii) The director delivers notice in the form of a record of the director's dissent or abstention to the presiding officer of the meeting before its adjournment or to the corporation promptly after adjournment of the meeting. (e) The right of dissent or abstention is not available to a director who votes in favor of the action taken. Section 86. (a) Unless this Act, the articles of incorporation, or the bylaws provide otherwise, a board of directors may create one or more committees of the board that consist of one or more directors. (b) Unless this Act otherwise provides, the creation of a committee and appointment of directors to it must be approved by the greater of: (1) A majority of all the directors in office when the action is taken; or (2) The number of directors required by the articles of incorporation or bylaws to take action pursuant to section 85 of this Act. (c) Sections 81 to 85, inclusive, of this Act, apply both to committees of the board and to their members. (d) To the extent authorized by the board of directors or in the articles of incorporation or bylaws, each committee may exercise the powers of the board of directors pursuant to section 69 of this Act except as limited by subsection (e). (e) A committee may not, however: (1) In the case of a membership corporation, approve or propose to members action that this Act requires be approved by members; (2) Fill vacancies on the board of directors or, subject to subsection (g), on any of its committees; or (3) Adopt, amend, or repeal bylaws. (f) The creation of, delegation of authority to, or action by a committee does not alone constitute compliance by a director with the standards of conduct described in section 87 of this Act. (g) The board of directors may appoint one or more directors as alternate members of any committee to replace any absent or disqualified member during the member's absence or disqualification. (h) A nonprofit corporation may create or authorize the creation of one or more advisory committees whose members need not be directors. An advisory committee: (1) Is not a committee of the board; and (2) May not exercise any of the powers of the board. Section 87. (a) Each member of the board of directors, when discharging the duties of a director, shall act: (1) In good faith; and (2) In a manner the director reasonably believes to be in the best interests of the nonprofit corporation. (b) The members of the board of directors or a committee of the board, when becoming informed in connection with their decision-making function or devoting attention to their oversight function, must discharge their duties with the care that a person in a like position would reasonably believe appropriate under similar circumstances. (c) In discharging board or committee duties a director must disclose, or cause to be disclosed, to the other board or committee members information not already known by them but known by the director to be material to the discharge of their decision-making or oversight functions, except that disclosure is not required to the extent that the director reasonably believes that doing so would violate a duty imposed by law, a legally enforceable obligation of confidentiality, or a professional ethics rule. (d) In discharging board or committee duties a director who does not have knowledge that makes reliance unwarranted may rely on the performance by any of the persons specified in subsection (f)(1), (3), or (4) to whom the board may have delegated, formally or informally by course of conduct, the authority or duty to perform one or more of the board's functions that are delegable under applicable law. (e) In discharging board or committee duties, a director who does not have knowledge that makes reliance unwarranted may rely on information, opinions, reports, or statements, including financial statements and other financial data, prepared or presented by any of the persons specified in subsection (f).

(g) A director is not a trustee with respect to the nonprofit corporation or with respect to any property held or administered by the corporation, including property that may be subject to restrictions imposed by the donor or transferor of the property. Section 88. (a) A nonprofit corporation may not lend money to or guarantee the obligation of a director or officer of the corporation. (b) This section does not apply to: (1) An advance to pay reimbursable expenses reasonably expected to be incurred by a director or officer; (2) An advance to pay premiums on life insurance if the advance is secured by the cash value of the policy; (3) Advances pursuant to sections 101 to 109, inclusive, of this Act; (4) Loans or advances pursuant to employee benefit plans; (5) A loan secured by the principal residence of an officer; or (6) A loan to pay relocation expenses of an officer. (c) The fact that a loan or guarantee is made in violation of this section does not affect the borrower's liability on the loan. Section 89. (a) A director who votes for or assents to a distribution made in violation of this Act is personally liable to the nonprofit corporation for the amount of the distribution that exceeds what could have been distributed without violating this Act if the party asserting liability establishes that, when taking the action, the director did not comply with section 87 of this Act. (b) A director held liable under subsection (a) for an unlawful distribution is entitled to: (1) Contribution from every other director who could be held liable under subsection (a) for the unlawful distribution; and (2) Recoupment from each person of the pro-rata portion of the amount of the unlawful distribution the person received, whether or not the person knew the distribution was made in violation of this Act. (c) A proceeding to enforce: (1) The liability of a director under subsection (a) is barred unless it is commenced within two years after the date on which the distribution was made; or (2) Contribution or recoupment under subsection (b) is barred unless it is commenced within one year after the liability of the claimant has been finally adjudicated under subsection (a).

(b) The articles of incorporation or bylaws or the board of directors must assign to one of the officers responsibility for preparing or supervising the preparation of the minutes of the meetings of the board of directors and the members, if any, and for maintaining and authenticating the records of the corporation required to be kept under sections 200(a) and 200(e) of this Act. (c) The same individual may simultaneously hold more than one office in a nonprofit corporation. Section 91. Each officer has the authority and must perform the duties set forth in the articles of incorporation or bylaws or, to the extent consistent with the articles and bylaws, the duties prescribed by the board of directors or by direction of an officer authorized by the board of directors to prescribe the duties of other officers.

(b) If the court determines that the director is entitled to indemnification pursuant to subsection (a)(1) or to indemnification or advance for expenses pursuant to subsection (a)(2), it must also order the nonprofit corporation to pay the director's reasonable expenses incurred in connection with obtaining court-ordered indemnification or advance for expenses. If the court determines that the director is entitled to indemnification or advance for expenses pursuant to subsection (a)(3), it may also order the corporation to pay the director's reasonable expenses to obtain court-ordered indemnification or advance for expenses. Section 106. (a) A nonprofit corporation may not indemnify a director pursuant to section 102 of this Act unless authorized for a specific proceeding after a determination has been made that indemnification of the director is permissible because the director has met the relevant standard of conduct set forth in section 102 of this Act.

Section 107. (a) A nonprofit corporation may indemnify and advance expenses pursuant to sections 101 to 109, inclusive, of this Act, to an officer of the corporation who is a party to a proceeding because the officer is or was an officer of the corporation: (1) To the same extent as a director; and (2) If the officer is an officer but not a director, to such further extent as may be provided by the articles of incorporation, the bylaws, a resolution of the board of directors, or contract except for: (i) Liability in connection with a proceeding by or in the right of the corporation other than for reasonable expenses incurred in connection with the proceeding; or (ii) Liability arising out of conduct that constitutes: (A) Receipt by the officer of a financial benefit to which the officer is not entitled; (B) An intentional infliction of harm on the corporation or the members; or (C) An intentional violation of criminal law. (b) The provisions of subsection (a)(2) apply to an officer who is also a director if the basis on which the officer is made a party to the proceeding is an act or omission solely as an officer. (c) An officer of a corporation who is not a director is entitled to mandatory indemnification pursuant to section 103 of this Act, and may apply to a court pursuant to section 105 of this Act for indemnification or an advance for expenses, in each case to the same extent to which a director may be entitled to indemnification or advance for expenses under those provisions. Section 108. A nonprofit corporation may purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of an individual who is or was a director or officer of the corporation, or who, while a director or officer of the corporation, serves or served at the corporation's request as a director, officer, partner, trustee, employee, or agent of another domestic or foreign corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan, or other entity, against liability asserted against or incurred by the individual in that capacity or arising from the individual's status as a director or officer, whether or not the corporation would have power to indemnify or advance expenses to the individual against the same liability pursuant to sections 101 to 109, inclusive, of this Act.

An obligatory provision satisfies the requirements for authorization referred to in sections 104(c) and 106(c) of this Act. Any such provision that obligates the corporation to provide indemnification to the fullest extent permitted by law obligates the corporation to advance funds to pay for or reimburse expenses in accordance with section 104 of this Act to the fullest extent permitted by law, unless the provision specifically provides otherwise. (b) Any provision pursuant to subsection (a) may not obligate the nonprofit corporation to indemnify or advance expenses to a director of a predecessor of the corporation, pertaining to conduct with respect to the predecessor, unless otherwise specifically provided. Any provision for indemnification or advance for expenses in the organic records, articles of incorporation, bylaws, or a resolution of the governors, board of directors, members or interest holders of a predecessor of the corporation in a fundamental transaction, or in a contract to which the predecessor is a party, existing at the time the fundamental transaction takes effect, is governed by: (1) Section 117(a)(2) of this Act in the case of a domestication; (2) Section 122(a)(2) of this Act in the case of a for-profit conversion; (3) Section 126(a)(2) of this Act in the case of a foreign for-profit domestication and conversion; (4) Section 132(a)(2) of this Act in the case of an entity conversion; or (5) Section 154(a)(4) of this Act in the case of a merger. (c) A nonprofit corporation may, by a provision in its articles of incorporation or bylaws, limit any of the rights to indemnification or advance for expenses created by or pursuant to sections 101 to 109, inclusive, of this Act. (d) Sections 101 to 109, inclusive, of this Act, do not limit a nonprofit corporation's power to pay or reimburse expenses incurred by a director or an officer in connection with appearance as a witness in a proceeding at a time when the director or officer is not a party. (e) Sections 101 to 109, inclusive, of this Act, do not limit a nonprofit corporation's power to indemnify, advance expenses to, or provide or maintain insurance on behalf of an employee, agent, or volunteer. Section 110. (a) A contract or transaction between a nonprofit corporation and one or more of its members, directors, members of a designated body, or officers or between a nonprofit corporation and any other entity in which one or more of its directors, members of a designated body, or officers are directors or officers, hold a similar position, or have a financial interest, is not void or voidable solely for that reason, or solely because the member, director, member of a designated body, or officer is present at or participates in the meeting of the board of directors that authorizes the contract or transaction, or solely because his, her or their votes are counted for that purpose, if: (1) The material facts as to the relationship or interest and as to the contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to the board of directors and the board in good faith authorizes the contract or transaction by the affirmative votes of a majority of the disinterested directors even though the disinterested directors are less than a quorum; (2) The material facts as to the relationship or interest of the member, director, or officer and as to the contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to the members entitled to vote thereon, if any, and the contract or transaction is specifically approved in good faith by vote of those members; or (3) The contract or transaction is fair as to the corporation as of the time it is authorized, approved, or ratified by the board of directors or the members. (b) Common or interested directors may be counted in determining the presence of a quorum at a meeting of the board that authorizes a contract or transaction specified in subsection (a). (c) This section is applicable except as otherwise restricted in the articles of incorporation or bylaws. Section 111. (a) The taking advantage, directly or indirectly, by a director of a business opportunity may not be the subject of equitable relief, or give rise to an award of damages or other sanctions against the director, in a proceeding by or in the right of the nonprofit corporation on the ground that the opportunity should have first been offered to the corporation, if before becoming legally obligated or entitled respecting the opportunity the director brings it to the attention of the corporation and action by the members or the directors disclaiming the corporation's interest in the opportunity is taken in compliance with the procedures set forth in section 110 of this Act, as if the decision being made concerned a conflicting interest transaction. (b) In any proceeding seeking equitable relief or other remedies, based upon an alleged improper taking advantage of a business opportunity by a director, the fact that the director did not employ the procedure described in subsection (a) before taking advantage of the opportunity does not support an inference that the opportunity should have been first presented to the nonprofit corporation or alter the burden of proof otherwise applicable to establish that the director breached a duty to the corporation in the circumstances. (c) For purposes of this section, director, includes a member of a designated body. Section 112. Terms used in section 112 to 133, inclusive, of this Act, mean: (1) \"Conversion,\" a transaction authorized by sections 119 to 123, inclusive, of this Act, sections 124 to 127, inclusive, of this Act, or sections 128 to 133, inclusive, of this Act; (2) \"Converting corporation,\" the domestic or foreign nonprofit or business corporation that approves a conversion pursuant to section 112 to 133, inclusive, of this Act, or its organic law; (3) \"Converting entity,\" the domestic or foreign entity that approves a conversion pursuant to section 128 of this Act, or its organic law; (4) \"Domesticated corporation,\" the domesticating corporation as it continues in existence after a domestication; (5) \"Domesticating corporation,\" the domestic nonprofit corporation that adopts a plan of domestication pursuant to section 115 of this Act, or the foreign nonprofit corporation that approves a domestication pursuant to its organic law; (6) \"Domestication,\" a transaction authorized by sections 114 to 118, inclusive, of this Act.

The notice must state that the purpose, or one of the purposes, of the meeting is to consider the plan and must contain or be accompanied by a copy or summary of the plan. The notice shall include or be accompanied by a copy of the organic documents as they will be in effect immediately after the entity conversion; (5) Unless the articles of incorporation, or the board of directors acting pursuant to paragraph (3), requires a greater vote or a greater number of votes to be present, the approval of the plan of entity conversion by the members requires the approval of each class of members of the corporation voting as a separate voting group at a meeting at which a quorum of the voting group exists; (6) If any provision of the articles of incorporation, bylaws, or an agreement to which any of the directors or members are parties, adopted or entered into before the effective date of sections 128 to 133, inclusive, of this Act, applies to a merger of the corporation and the document does not refer to an entity conversion of the corporation, the provision shall be deemed to apply to an entity conversion of the corporation until such time as the provision is subsequently amended; (7) If as a result of the conversion one or more members of the corporation would become subject to interest holder liability for the debts, obligations, or liabilities of any other person or entity, approval of the plan of conversion shall require the execution, by each such member, of a separate written consent to become subject to such interest holder liability.

(h) The assets of a direct or indirect consolidated subsidiary are deemed the assets of the parent nonprofit corporation for the purposes of this section. (i) In addition to the approval of a disposition of assets by the board of directors and members as required by this section, the disposition must also be approved in the form of a record by any person or group of persons whose approval is required pursuant to section 147 of this Act to amend the articles of incorporation or bylaws.

(b) The plaintiff in a derivative proceeding must be a member, director, or member of a designated body at the time of bringing the proceeding. A plaintiff who is a member must also have been a member at the time of any action complained of in the derivative proceeding. Section 161. No person may commence a derivative proceeding until: (1) A demand in the form of a record has been delivered to the nonprofit corporation to take suitable action; and (2) Ninety days have expired from the date the demand is effective unless the person was notified earlier that the demand is rejected by the corporation or unless irreparable injury to the corporation would result by waiting for the expiration of the ninety-day period. Section 162. (a) If the nonprofit corporation commences an inquiry into the allegations made in the demand or complaint, the court may stay any derivative proceeding for such period as the court deems appropriate. (b) See section 166 of this Act, applicability to foreign corporations. Section 163. (a) A derivative proceeding shall be dismissed by the court on motion by the nonprofit corporation if one of the groups specified in subsection (b) or (e) determining in good faith after conducting a reasonable inquiry upon which its conclusions are based that the maintenance of the derivative proceeding is not in the best interests of the corporation.

(c) If a derivative proceeding is commenced after a determination has been made rejecting a demand by a member, the complaint must allege with particularity facts establishing either: (1) That a majority of the board of directors did not consist of independent directors at the time the determination is made; or (2) That the requirements of subsection (a) have not been met.

(e) The court may appoint a panel of one or more independent persons upon motion by the nonprofit corporation to make a determination whether the maintenance of the derivative proceeding is in the best interests of the corporation. In such case, the plaintiff has the burden of proving that the requirements of subsection (a) have not been met. (f) A person is independent for purposes of this section if the person does not have: (1) A material interest in the outcome of the proceeding; or (2) A material relationship with a person who has such an interest. (g) None of the following shall by itself cause a director to be considered not independent for purposes of this section: (1) The nomination, election, or appointment of the director by persons who are defendants in the derivative proceeding or against whom action is demanded; (2) The naming of the director as a defendant in the derivative proceeding or as a person against whom action is demanded; or (3) The approval by the director of the act being challenged in the derivative proceeding or demand if the act resulted in no personal benefit to the director. Section 164. (a) A derivative proceeding may not be discontinued or settled without the court's approval.

The amount of security may be increased or decreased in the discretion of the court upon a showing that the security provided has or may become inadequate or excessive. Security may be denied or limited in the discretion of the court upon a preliminary showing, by application and upon such types of proof as may be required by the court, establishing prima facie that the requirement of full or partial security would impose undue hardship on plaintiffs and serious injustice would result. (b) On termination of the derivative proceeding the court may: (1) Order the nonprofit corporation to pay the plaintiff's reasonable expenses, including counsel fees, incurred in the proceeding if it finds that the proceeding has resulted in a substantial benefit to the corporation; (2) Order the plaintiff to pay any defendant's reasonable expenses, including counsel fees, incurred in defending the proceeding if it finds that the proceeding was commenced or maintained without reasonable cause or for an improper purpose; or (3) Order a party to pay an opposing party's reasonable expenses, including counsel fees, incurred because of the filing of a pleading, motion, or other paper, if it finds that the pleading, motion, or other paper was not well grounded in fact, after reasonable inquiry, or warranted by existing law or a good faith argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law and was interposed for an improper purpose, such as to harass or cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of litigation. (c) See section 166 of this Act, applicability to foreign corporations. Section 166. In any derivative proceeding in the right of a foreign nonprofit corporation, the matters covered by section 159 to 167 inclusive, of this Act shall be governed by the laws of the jurisdiction of incorporation of the foreign corporation except for sections 162, 164, and 165 of this Act. Section 167. The plaintiff in a derivative proceeding must notify the attorney general within ten days after commencing the proceeding if it involves a charitable corporation. Section 168. A majority of the incorporators or directors of a nonprofit corporation that has not commenced activity, or of a membership corporation that has not admitted any members, may dissolve the corporation by delivering to the Office of the Secretary of State for filing articles of dissolution that set forth: (1) The name of the corporation; (2) The date of its incorporation; (3) Either: (i) That the corporation has not commenced activity; or (ii) That the corporation is a membership corporation and has not admitted any members; (4) That no debt of the corporation remains unpaid; (5) That, except as provided in the articles of incorporation or bylaws, the net assets of the corporation remaining after winding up have been distributed to the members, if members were admitted; and (6) That a majority of the incorporators or directors authorized the dissolution. Section 169. (a) The board of directors of a membership corporation may propose dissolution for submission to the members. (b) For a proposal to dissolve to be adopted: (1) The board of directors must recommend dissolution to the members, unless the board of directors determines that because of conflict of interest or other special circumstances it should make no recommendation and communicates the basis for its determination to the members; and (2) The members entitled to vote must approve the proposal to dissolve as provided in subsection (e). (c) The board of directors may condition its submission of the proposal for dissolution on any basis. (d) The nonprofit corporation must give notice to each member entitled to vote of the proposed meeting of members. The notice must also state: (1) That the purpose, or one of the purposes, of the meeting is to consider dissolving the corporation; and (2) How the assets of the corporation will be distributed after all creditors are paid, or how the distribution of assets will be determined. (e) Unless the articles of incorporation, the bylaws, or the board of directors acting pursuant to subsection (c), requires a greater vote or a greater number of members to be present, the adoption of the proposal to dissolve by the members requires the approval of the members at a meeting of at least two-thirds of the votes entitled to be cast by members present or represented by proxy. (f) If the nonprofit corporation does not have any members entitled to vote on its dissolution, a proposal to dissolve shall be deemed adopted by the corporation when it has been adopted by a majority the board of directors. (g) A charitable corporation must give the attorney general notice in the form of a record that it intends to dissolve before the time it delivers articles of dissolution to the Office of the Secretary of State. Section 170. At any time after dissolution is authorized, the nonprofit corporation may dissolve by delivering to the Office of the Secretary of State for filing articles of dissolution setting forth: (1) The name of the nonprofit corporation; (2) The date dissolution was authorized; and (3) If dissolution was approved by the members, a statement that the proposal to dissolve was duly approved by the members in the manner required by this chapter and by the articles of incorporation. A nonprofit corporation is dissolved upon the effective date of its articles of dissolution. The term, dissolved nonprofit corporation, means a nonprofit corporation whose articles of dissolution have become effective and includes a successor entity to which the remaining assets of the corporation are transferred subject to its liabilities for purposes of liquidation. Section 171. A nonprofit corporation may revoke its dissolution within one hundred twenty days of its effective date. Revocation of dissolution must be authorized in the same manner as the dissolution was authorized unless that authorization permitted revocation by action of the board of directors alone, in which event the board of directors may revoke the dissolution. After the revocation of dissolution is authorized, the nonprofit corporation may revoke the dissolution by delivering to the Office of the Secretary of State for filing articles of revocation of dissolution, together with a copy of its articles of dissolution, that set forth: (1) The name of the nonprofit corporation; (2) The effective date of the dissolution that was revoked; (3) The date that the revocation of dissolution was authorized; (4) If the corporation's board of directors, or incorporators, revoked the dissolution, a statement to that effect; (5) If the nonprofit corporation's board of directors revoked a dissolution authorized by the members, a statement that revocation was permitted by action by the board of directors alone pursuant to that authorization; and (6) If member action was required to revoke the dissolution, the information required by section 170 of this Act. Revocation of dissolution is effective upon the effective date of the articles of revocation of dissolution. When the revocation of dissolution is effective, it relates back to and takes effect as of the effective date of the dissolution and the nonprofit corporation resumes carrying on its business as if dissolution had never occurred. Section 172. (a) A dissolved nonprofit corporation continues its corporate existence but may not carry on any activities except those appropriate to wind up and liquidate its affairs, including: (1) Collecting its assets; (2) Disposing of its properties that will not be distributed in kind; (3) Discharging or making provision for discharging its liabilities; (4) Distributing its remaining property as required by law and its articles of incorporation and bylaws; and otherwise as approved when the dissolution was approved or among the members per capita; and (5) Doing every other act necessary to wind up and liquidate its activities and affairs. (b) Dissolution of a nonprofit corporation does not: (1) Transfer title to the corporation's property; (2) Subject its directors, members of a designated body, or officers to standards of conduct different from those prescribed in sections 69 to 111 of this Act; (3) Change quorum or voting requirements for its board of directors or members; change provisions for selection, resignation, or removal of its directors or officers or both; or change provisions for amending its bylaws; (4) Prevent commencement of a proceeding by or against the corporation in its corporate name; (5) Abate or suspend a proceeding pending by or against the corporation on the effective date of dissolution; or (6) Terminate the authority of the registered agent of the corporation. (c) Property held in trust or otherwise dedicated to a charitable purpose may not be diverted from its purpose by the dissolution of a nonprofit corporation unless and until the corporation obtains an order of circuit court pursuant to the law of this state on cy pres or otherwise dealing with the nondiversion of charitable assets. The attorney general shall be provided with notice of any action concerning the same. (d) A person who is a member or otherwise affiliated with a charitable corporation may not receive a direct or indirect financial benefit in connection with the dissolution of the corporation unless the person is a charitable corporation or an unincorporated entity that has a charitable purpose. This subsection does not apply to the receipt of reasonable compensation for services rendered. Section 173. (a) A dissolved nonprofit corporation may dispose of the known claims against it by delivering notice to its known claimants of the dissolution at any time after its effective date. (b) The notice must be in the form of a record and: (1) Describe information that must be included in a claim; (2) Provide a mailing address where a claim may be sent; (3) State the deadline, which may not be fewer than one hundred twenty days from the effective date of the notice, by which the dissolved nonprofit corporation must receive the claim; and (4) State that the claim will be barred if not received by the deadline. (c) A claim against the dissolved nonprofit corporation is barred: (1) If a claimant who is given notice pursuant to subsection (b) does not deliver the claim to the dissolved corporation by the deadline; or (2) If a claimant whose claim is rejected by the dissolved corporation does not commence a proceeding to enforce the claim within 90 days from the effective date of the rejection notice. (d) For purposes of this section, claim, does not include a contingent liability or a claim based on an event occurring after the effective date of dissolution. Section 174. (a) A dissolved nonprofit corporation may publish notice of its dissolution and request that persons with claims against the dissolved corporation present them in accordance with the notice. (b) The notice must: (1) Be published one time in a newspaper of general circulation in the county where the principal office of the dissolved nonprofit corporation, or, if none in this state, its registered office, is or was last located; (2) Describe the information that must be included in a claim and provide a mailing address where the claim must be sent; and (3) State that a claim against the dissolved corporation will be barred unless a proceeding to enforce the claim is commenced within three years after the publication of the notice. (c) If the dissolved nonprofit corporation publishes a newspaper notice in accordance with subsection (b), the claim of each of the following claimants is barred unless the claimant commences a proceeding to enforce the claim against the dissolved corporation within three years after the publication date of the newspaper notice: (1) A claimant who is given notice pursuant to section 173 of this Act; (2) A claimant whose claim is timely sent to the dissolved corporation but not acted on; or (3) A claimant whose claim is contingent or based on an event occurring after the effective date of dissolution. (d) A claim that is not barred by section 173(b) or section 174(c) of this Act may be enforced: (1) Against the dissolved nonprofit corporation, to the extent of its undistributed assets; or (2) Except as provided in section 175(d) of this Act, if the assets are distributed in liquidation, against any person, other than a creditor of the dissolved corporation, to whom the corporation distributed its property to the extent of the distributee's pro rata share of the claim or the corporate assets distributed to the distribute in liquidation, whichever is less, but a distributee's total liability for all claims under this section may not exceed the total amount of assets distributed to the distributee. Section 175. (a) A dissolved nonprofit corporation that publishes a notice pursuant to section 174 of this Act may file an application with the circuit court of the county where the dissolved corporation's principal office, or, if none in this state, its registered office, is located for a determination of the amount and form of security to be provided for payment of claims that are contingent or have not been made known to the dissolved corporation or that are based on an event occurring after the effective date of dissolution but that, based on the facts known to the dissolved corporation, are reasonably estimated to arise after the effective date of dissolution. Provision need not be made for any claim that is or is reasonably anticipated to be barred pursuant to section 174(c) of this Act. (b) Within ten days after the filing of the application, notice of the proceeding must be given by the dissolved nonprofit corporation to each claimant holding a contingent claim whose contingent claim is shown on the records of the dissolved corporation. (c) The court may appoint a guardian ad litem to represent all claimants whose identities are unknown in any proceeding brought pursuant to this section. The reasonable fees and expenses of the guardian, including all reasonable expert witness fees, must be paid by the dissolved nonprofit corporation. (d) Provision by the dissolved nonprofit corporation for security in the amount and the form ordered by the court pursuant to section 175(a) of this Act satisfies the dissolved corporation's obligations with respect to claims that are contingent, have not been made known to the dissolved corporation or are based on an event occurring after the effective date of dissolution, and such claims may not be enforced against a person who received assets in liquidation. Section 176. (a) Directors shall cause the dissolved nonprofit corporation to discharge or make reasonable provision for the payment of claims and make distributions of assets after payment or provision for claims. (b) Directors of a dissolved nonprofit corporation that has disposed of claims pursuant to sections 173, 174, or 175 of this Act shall not be liable for breach of section 176(a) of this Act with respect to claims against the dissolved corporation that are barred or satisfied pursuant to sections 173, 174, or 175 of this Act. Section 177. The Office of the Secretary of State may commence a proceeding pursuant to section 178 of this Act to administratively dissolve a nonprofit corporation if: (1) The nonprofit corporation does not pay within sixty days after they are due any filing fees or penalties imposed by sections 168 to 185, inclusive, of this Act, or other law; (2) The nonprofit corporation does not deliver its annual report to the Office of the Secretary of State within sixty days after it is due; (3) The nonprofit corporation is without a registered agent in this state for sixty days or more; (4) The nonprofit corporation does not notify the Office of the Secretary of State within sixty days that its registered agent has been changed or that its registered agent has resigned; or (5) The nonprofit corporation's period of duration stated in its articles of incorporation expires. Section 178. If the Office of the Secretary of State determines that one or more grounds exist pursuant to section 177 of this Act for dissolving a nonprofit corporation, the Office of the Secretary of State shall serve the nonprofit corporation with written notice of that determination. If the nonprofit corporation does not correct each ground for dissolution or demonstrate to the reasonable satisfaction of the Office of the Secretary of State that each ground determined by the Office of the Secretary of State does not exist within sixty days after service of the notice is perfected, the Office of the Secretary of State shall administratively dissolve the corporation by signing a certificate of dissolution that recites the ground or grounds for dissolution and its effective date. The Office of the Secretary of State shall file the original of the certificate and serve a copy on the corporation. A nonprofit corporation administratively dissolved continues its corporate existence but may not carry on any business except that necessary to wind up and liquidate its business and affairs pursuant to section 172 of this Act and notify claimants pursuant to sections 173 and 174 of this Act. The administrative dissolution of a nonprofit corporation does not terminate the authority of its registered agent. Section 179. A nonprofit corporation administratively dissolved pursuant to section 178 of this Act may apply to the Office of the Secretary of State for reinstatement any time after the effective date of dissolution. The application must: (1) Recite the name of the corporation and the effective date of its administrative dissolution; (2) State that the ground or grounds for dissolution either did not exist or have been eliminated; (3) State that the nonprofit corporation's name satisfies the requirements of section 30 of this Act; and (4) Contain a certificate from the Department of Revenue in this state reciting that all taxes and fees administered and collected by the department which are owed by the nonprofit corporation have been paid. If the Office of the Secretary of State determines that the application contains the information required by this section and that the information is correct, the Office of the Secretary of State shall cancel the certificate of dissolution and prepare a certificate of reinstatement that recites that determination and the effective date of reinstatement, file the original of the certificate, and serve a copy on the corporation. When the reinstatement is effective, it relates back to and takes effect as of the effective date of the administrative dissolution and the nonprofit corporation resumes carrying on its business as if the administrative dissolution had never occurred. Section 180. If the Office of the Secretary of State denies a nonprofit corporation's application for reinstatement following administrative dissolution, the Office of the Secretary of State shall serve the nonprofit corporation with a written notice that explains the reason or reasons for denial. The nonprofit corporation may appeal the denial of reinstatement to the circuit court within thirty days after service of the notice of denial is perfected. The nonprofit corporation appeals by petitioning the court to set aside the dissolution and attaching to the petition copies of the Office of the Secretary of State's certificate of dissolution, the nonprofit corporation's application for reinstatement, and the Office of the Secretary of State's notice of denial. The court may summarily order the Office of the Secretary of State to reinstate the dissolved nonprofit corporation or may take other action the court considers appropriate. The court's final decision may be appealed as in other civil proceedings. Section 181. The circuit court may dissolve a nonprofit corporation: (1) In a proceeding by the attorney general, if it is established that: (i) The corporation obtained its articles of incorporation through fraud; or (ii) The corporation has exceeded or abused, and is continuing to exceed or abuse the authority conferred upon it by law; (2) Except as provided in the articles of incorporation or bylaws, in a proceeding by fifty members or members holding at least five percent of the voting power, whichever is less, or by a director or member of a designated body, if it is established that: (i) The directors or a designated body are deadlocked in the management of the corporate affairs, the members, if any, are unable to break the deadlock, and irreparable injury to the corporation or its mission is threatened or being suffered because of the deadlock; (ii) The directors or those in control of the corporation have acted, are acting, or will act in a manner that is illegal, oppressive, or fraudulent; (iii) The members are deadlocked in voting power and have failed, for a period that includes at least two consecutive annual meeting dates, to elect successors to directors whose terms have, or otherwise would have, expired; (iv) The corporate assets are being misapplied or wasted; or (v) The corporation has insufficient assets to continue its activities and it is no longer able to assemble a quorum of directors or members; (3) In a proceeding by a creditor, if it is established that: (i) The creditor's claim has been reduced to judgment, the execution on the judgment returned unsatisfied, and the corporation is insolvent; or (ii) The corporation has admitted in a record that the creditor's claim is due and owing and the corporation is insolvent; or (4) In a proceeding by the corporation to have its voluntary dissolution continued under court supervision. Section 182. (a) Venue for a proceeding by the attorney general to dissolve a nonprofit corporation lies in the county in which the registered office of the corporation is situated, or in the circuit court for Hughes County. Venue for a proceeding brought by any other party named in section 181 of this Act lies in the county where a corporation's principal office, or, if none in this state, its registered office, is or was last located. (b) It is not necessary to make directors or members parties to a proceeding to dissolve a nonprofit corporation unless relief is sought against them individually. (c) A court in a proceeding brought to dissolve a nonprofit corporation may issue injunctions, appoint a receiver or custodian pendente lite with all powers and duties the court directs, take other action required to preserve the corporate assets wherever located, and carry on the activities of the corporation until a full hearing can be held. Section 183. (a) A court in a judicial proceeding brought to dissolve a nonprofit corporation may appoint one or more receivers to wind up and liquidate, or one or more custodians to manage, the affairs of the corporation. The court shall hold a hearing, after giving notice to all parties to the proceeding and any interested persons designated by the court, before appointing a receiver or custodian. The court appointing a receiver or custodian has exclusive jurisdiction over the corporation and all of its property wherever located. (b) The court may require the receiver or custodian to post bond, with or without sureties, in an amount the court directs. (c) The court shall describe the powers and duties of the receiver or custodian in its appointing order, which may be amended from time to time. Among other powers: (1) The receiver: (i) May dispose of all or any part of the assets of the nonprofit corporation wherever located, at a public or private sale, if authorized by the court; and (ii) May sue and defend in the receiver's own name as receiver of the corporation in all courts of this state; (2) The custodian may exercise all of the powers of the corporation, through or in place of its board of directors and any designated body, to the extent necessary to manage the affairs of the corporation consistent with its mission and in the best interests of its members, if any, and creditors. (d) During a receivership, the court may redesignate the receiver a custodian, and during a custodianship may redesignate the custodian a receiver, if doing so is consistent with the mission of the nonprofit corporation and in the best interests of the corporation, its members, and creditors. (e) The court from time to time during the receivership or custodianship may order compensation paid and expense disbursements or reimbursements made to the receiver or custodian and counsel from the assets of the nonprofit corporation or proceeds from the sale of the assets. (f) This section does not apply to a nonprofit corporation that is a religious organization. Section 184. (a) If after a hearing the court determines that one or more grounds for judicial dissolution described in section 180 of this Act exist, it may enter a decree dissolving the nonprofit corporation and specifying the effective date of the dissolution, and the clerk of the court shall deliver a certified copy of the decree to the Office of the Secretary of State, who shall file it. (b) After entering the decree of dissolution, the court shall direct the winding-up and liquidation of the nonprofit corporation's affairs in accordance with section 172 of this Act and the notification of claimants in accordance with sections 173 and 174 of this Act. Section 185. Assets of a dissolved nonprofit corporation that should be transferred to a creditor, claimant, or member of the corporation who cannot be found or who is not competent to receive them shall be reduced to cash and deposited with the state treasurer or other appropriate state official for safekeeping. When the creditor, claimant, or member furnishes satisfactory proof of entitlement to the amount deposited, the state treasurer or other appropriate state official shall pay the amount held. Section 186. (a) A foreign nonprofit corporation may not conduct activities in this state until it obtains a certificate of authority from the Office of the Secretary of State.

(a) A foreign nonprofit corporation conducting activities in this state without a certificate of authority may not maintain a proceeding in any court in this state until it obtains a certificate of authority. (b) The successor to a foreign nonprofit corporation that conducted activities in this state without a certificate of authority and the assignee of a cause of action arising out of those activities may not maintain a proceeding based on that cause of action in any court in this state until the foreign corporation or its successor obtains a certificate of authority. (c) A court may stay a proceeding commenced by a foreign nonprofit corporation, its successor, or assignee until it determines whether the foreign corporation or its successor requires a certificate of authority. If it so determines, the court may further stay the proceeding until the foreign corporation or its successor obtains the certificate. (d) Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b), the failure of a foreign corporation to obtain a certificate of authority does not impair the validity of its corporate acts or prevent it from defending any proceeding in this state. Section 188. A foreign nonprofit corporation may apply for a certificate of authority to conduct activities in this state by delivering an application to the Office of the Secretary of State for filing. The application must set forth: (1) The name of the foreign corporation or, if its name is unavailable for use in this state, a corporate name that satisfies the requirements of section 191 of this Act; (2) The name of the state or country under whose law it is incorporated; (3) Its date of incorporation and period of duration, if any; (4) The street address of its principal office; and (5) The address of its registered office in this state and the name of its registered agent at that office; and (6) The names and usual business addresses of its current directors and officers.

Upon receipt of process, the Office of the Secretary of State must mail a copy of the process to the foreign unincorporated entity at the mailing address set forth under subsection (a)(4). (c) After the withdrawal pursuant to this section of a corporation that has converted to a domestic unincorporated entity is effective, service of process must be made on the unincorporated entity in accordance with the regular procedures for service of process on the form of unincorporated entity to which the corporation was converted. Section 196. (a) A foreign nonprofit corporation authorized to conduct activities in this state that converts to a foreign business corporation or to any form of foreign unincorporated entity that is required to obtain a certificate of authority or make a similar type of filing with the Office of the Secretary of State if it transacts business in this state must file with the Office of the Secretary of State an application for transfer of authority executed by any officer or other duly authorized representative. The application must set forth: (1) The name of the corporation; (2) The type of entity to which it has been converted and the jurisdiction whose laws govern its internal affairs; (3) Any other information that would be required in a filing under the laws of this state by an entity of the type the corporation has become seeking authority to conduct activities or transact business in this state.

(c) Upon the effectiveness of the application for transfer of authority, the authority of the corporation pursuant to sections 186 to 199 of this Act to conduct activities in this state shall be transferred without interruption to the converted entity which shall thereafter hold such authority subject to the provisions of the laws of this state applicable to that type of entity. Section 197. The Office of the Secretary of State may commence a proceeding pursuant to section 198 of this Act to revoke the certificate of authority of a foreign corporation authorized to conduct activities in this state if: (1) The foreign nonprofit corporation does not deliver its annual report to the Office of the Secretary of State within sixty days after it is due; (2) The foreign nonprofit corporation does not pay within sixty days after they are due any franchise taxes or penalties imposed by this chapter or other law; (3) The foreign nonprofit corporation is without a registered agent in this state for sixty days or more; (4) The foreign nonprofit corporation does not inform the Office of the Secretary of State by an appropriate filing that its registered agent has changed or that its registered agent has resigned within sixty days of the change or resignation; (5) An incorporator, director, officer, or agent of the foreign nonprofit corporation signed a document knowing it was false in any material respect with intent that the document be delivered to the Office of the Secretary of State for filing; (6) The Office of the Secretary of State receives a duly authenticated certificate from the Office of the Secretary of State or other official having custody of corporate records in the state or country under whose law the foreign nonprofit corporation is incorporated stating that it has been dissolved or disappeared as the result of a merger. Section 198. (a) If the Office of the Secretary of State determines that one or more grounds exist pursuant to section 197 of this Act for revocation of a certificate of authority, the Office of the Secretary of State shall serve the foreign nonprofit corporation with written notice of that determination. If the foreign nonprofit corporation does not correct each ground for revocation or demonstrate to the reasonable satisfaction of the Office of the Secretary of State that each ground determined by the Office of the Secretary of State does not exist within sixty days after service of the notice, the Office of the Secretary of State may revoke the foreign nonprofit corporation's certificate of authority by signing a certificate of revocation that recites the ground or grounds for revocation and its effective date. The Office of the Secretary of State shall file the original of the certificate and serve a copy on the foreign corporation. The authority of a foreign nonprofit corporation to conduct activities in this state ceases on the date shown on the certificate revoking its certificate of authority. (b) The Office of the Secretary of State's revocation of a foreign nonprofit corporation's certificate of authority appoints the Office of the Secretary of State the foreign nonprofit corporation's agent for service of process in any proceeding based on a cause of action which arose during the time the foreign nonprofit corporation was authorized to conduct activities in this state. Service of process on the Office of the Secretary of State pursuant to this section is service on the foreign nonprofit corporation. Upon receipt of process, the Office of the Secretary of State shall mail a copy of the process to the secretary of the foreign nonprofit corporation at its principal office shown in its most recent annual report or in any subsequent communication received from the nonprofit corporation stating the current mailing address of its principal office, or, if none are on file, in its application for a certificate of authority. Revocation of a foreign nonprofit corporation's certificate of authority does not terminate the authority of the registered agent of the nonprofit corporation. Section 199. A foreign nonprofit corporation may appeal the Office of the Secretary of State's revocation of its certificate of authority to the circuit court within thirty days after service of the certificate of revocation. The foreign nonprofit corporation appeals by petitioning the court to set aside the revocation and attaching to the petition copies of its certificate of authority and the Office of the Secretary of State's certificate of revocation. The court may summarily order the Office of the Secretary of State to reinstate the certificate of authority or may take any other action the court considers appropriate. The court's final decision may be appealed as in other civil proceedings. Section 200. (a) A nonprofit corporation must keep as permanent records minutes of all meetings of its members, board of directors, and any designated body, a record of all actions taken by the members, board of directors, or members of a designated body without a meeting, and a record of all actions taken by a committee of the board of directors or a designated body on behalf of the corporation. (b) A nonprofit corporation must maintain appropriate accounting records.

Section 201. (a) A member of a nonprofit corporation is entitled to inspect and copy, during regular business hours at the corporation's principal office, any of the records of the corporation described in section 200(e) of this Act if the member delivers to the corporation a signed notice in the form of a record at least five business days before the date on which the member wishes to inspect and copy. (b) A member of a nonprofit corporation is entitled to inspect and copy, during regular business hours at a reasonable location specified by the corporation, any of the following records of the corporation if the member meets the requirements of subsection (c) and delivers to the corporation a signed notice in the form of a record at least five business days before the date on which the member wishes to inspect and copy: (1) Excerpts from any records required to be maintained pursuant to section 200(a) of this Act, to the extent not subject to inspection pursuant to section 201(a) of this Act; (2) Accounting records of the corporation; and (3) Subject to section 206 of this Act, the membership list. (c) A member may inspect and copy the records described in subsection (b) only if: (1) The member's demand is made in good faith and for a proper purpose; (2) The member describes with reasonable particularity the purpose and the records the member desires to inspect; and (3) The records are directly connected with this purpose. (d) The right of inspection granted by this section may be abolished or limited by a nonprofit corporation's articles of incorporation or bylaws. (e) This section does not affect: (1) The right of a member to inspect records pursuant to section 59 of this Act or, if the member is in litigation with the corporation, to the same extent as any other litigant; or (2) The power of a court, independently of this Act, to compel the production of corporate records for examination. Section 202. (a) A member's agent or attorney has the same inspection and copying rights as the member represented. (b) The right to copy records pursuant to section 201 of this Act includes, if reasonable, the right to receive copies. Copies may be provided through an electronic transmission if available and so requested by the member. (c) The nonprofit corporation may comply at its expense with a member's demand to inspect the record of members pursuant to section 201(b)(3) of this Act by providing the member with a list of members that was compiled no earlier than the date of the member's demand. (d) The nonprofit corporation may impose a reasonable charge, covering the costs of labor and material, for copies of any documents provided to the member. The charge may not exceed the estimated cost of production, reproduction, or transmission of the records. Section 203. (a) If a nonprofit corporation does not allow a member who complies with section 201(a) of this Act to inspect and copy any records required by that subsection to be available for inspection, the circuit court of the county where the corporation's principal office, or, if none in this state, its registered office, is located may summarily order inspection and copying of the records demanded at the corporation's expense upon application of the member. (b) If a nonprofit corporation does not within a reasonable time allow a member to inspect and copy any other record, the member who complies with sections 201(b) and (c) of this Act may apply to the circuit court in the county where the corporation's principal office is located, or, if none in this state, in Hughes County, for an order to permit inspection and copying of the records demanded. The court shall dispose of an application under this subsection on an expedited basis. (c) If the court orders inspection and copying of the records demanded, it shall also order the nonprofit corporation to pay the member's costs, including reasonable counsel fees, incurred to obtain the order unless the corporation proves that it refused inspection in good faith because it had a reasonable basis for doubt about the right of the member to inspect the records demanded. (d) If the court orders inspection and copying of the records demanded, it may impose reasonable restrictions on the use or distribution of the records by the demanding member. Section 204. (a) A director of a nonprofit corporation is entitled to inspect and copy the books, records, and documents of the corporation at any reasonable time to the extent reasonably related to the performance of the director's duties as a director, including duties as a member of a committee, but not for any other purpose or in any manner that would violate any duty to the corporation or law other than this Act. (b) The circuit court of the county where the nonprofit corporation's principal office is located, or if none in this state, in Hughes County, may order inspection and copying of the books, records, and documents at the corporation's expense, upon application of a director who has been refused such inspection rights, unless the corporation establishes that the director is not entitled to such inspection rights. The court shall dispose of an application pursuant to this subsection on an expedited basis. (c) If an order is issued, the court may include provisions protecting the nonprofit corporation from undue burden or expense, and prohibiting the director from using information obtained upon exercise of the inspection rights in a manner that would violate a duty to the corporation, and may also order the corporation to reimburse the director for the director's costs, including reasonable counsel fees, incurred in connection with the application. Section 205. (a) Whenever notice would otherwise be required to be given under any provision of this Act to a member, the notice need not be given if notice of two consecutive annual meetings, and all notices of meetings during the period between such two consecutive annual meetings have been returned undeliverable or could not be delivered. (b) If a member delivers to the nonprofit corporation a notice setting forth the member's then-current address, the requirement that notice be given to that member is reinstated. Section 206. (a) Without consent of the board of directors, a membership list or any part thereof may not be obtained or used by any person for any purpose unrelated to a member's interest as a member. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, without the consent of the board a membership list or any part thereof may not be: (1) Used to solicit money or property unless the money or property will be used solely to solicit the votes of the members in an election to be held by the nonprofit corporation; (2) Used for any commercial purpose; or (3) Sold to or purchased by any person. (b) Instead of making a membership list available for inspection and copying pursuant to sections 200 to 206, inclusive, of this Act, a nonprofit corporation may elect to proceed under the procedures set forth in section 59(f) of this Act. Section 207. (a) Except as provided in the articles of incorporation or bylaws of a nonprofit corporation engaged in religious activity, upon a demand in the form of a record from a member, a corporation must furnish that member with its latest annual financial statements, which may be consolidated or combined statements of the corporation and one or more of its subsidiaries, as appropriate, that include a balance sheet as of the end of the fiscal year and a statement of operations for the year. If financial statements are prepared for the corporation on the basis of generally accepted accounting principles, the annual financial statements must also be prepared on that basis. (b) If the annual financial statements are reported upon by a certified public accountant, the accountant's report must accompany them. If not, the statements must be accompanied by a statement of the president or the person responsible for the nonprofit corporation's accounting records: (1) Stating the reasonable belief of the president or other person as to whether the statements were prepared on the basis of generally accepted accounting principles and, if not, describing the basis of preparation; and (2) Describing any respects in which the statements were not prepared on a basis of accounting consistent with the statements prepared for the preceding year.

Section 209. A foreign nonprofit corporation authorized to conduct activities in this state on the effective date of this Act is subject to this Act but is not required to obtain a new certificate of authority to conduct activities under this Act. Section 210. (a) Except as provided in subsection (b), the repeal of a statute by this Act does not affect: (1) The operation of the statute or any action taken under it before its repeal; (2) Any ratification, right, remedy, privilege, obligation, or liability acquired, accrued, or incurred under the statute before its repeal; (3) Any violation of the statute, or any penalty, forfeiture, or punishment incurred because of the violation, before its repeal; (4) Any proceeding, reorganization, or dissolution commenced under the statute before its repeal, and the proceeding, reorganization, or dissolution may be completed in accordance with the statute as if it had not been repealed. (b) If a penalty or punishment imposed for violation of a statute repealed by this Act is reduced by this Act, the penalty or punishment if not already imposed shall be imposed in accordance with this Act. (c) Members of a nonprofit corporation who were entitled to cumulate their votes for the election of directors on the effective date of this Act shall continue to be entitled to cumulate their votes for the election of directors until otherwise provided in the articles of incorporation or bylaws of the corporation. (d) This Act modifies, limits, or supersedes the federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7001 et seq., but this Act does not modify, limit, or supersede section 101(c) of that act or authorize electronic delivery of any of the notices described in section 103(b) of that act. Section 211. If any provision of this Act or its application to any person or circumstance is held invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity does not affect other provisions or applications of this Act that can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to this end the provisions of this Act are severable. Section 212. In applying and construing this Act, consideration must be given to the need to promote consistency of the law with respect to its subject matter among states that enact it. Section 213.
