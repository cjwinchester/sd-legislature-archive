XII, \u00a7 6, the state investment officer shall determine the market value of the education enhancement trust fund as of December 31, 2003, and each calendar year thereafter less the investment expenses transferred pursuant to \u00a7 4-5-30.

For the purpose of this section, the term, principal, means the sum of all contributions to the fund. Beginning with the distribution in fiscal year 2007, the market value shall be determined by adding the market value of the trust fund at the end of the sixteen most recent calendar quarters as of December thirty-first, and dividing the sum by sixteen. Upon notice of that amount by the state investment officer, the state treasurer shall transfer the amount from the education enhancement trust fund to the state general fund as soon as practicable after July first of the next fiscal year."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 20675, "action_date": "2006-01-19T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 106850, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/106850.pdf", "status_text": "First read in Senate and referred to", "journal_page": 111, "committee_id_action": 894, "committee_id_assigned": 892, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 20675, "action_date": "2006-01-27T08:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 107395, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/107395.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 892, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 20675, "action_date": "2006-02-03T08:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 107906, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/107906.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 892, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 20675, "action_date": "2006-02-03T08:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 107906, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/107906.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to 36th legislative day", "journal_page": 352, "committee_id_action": 892, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 64125, "president_vote": null, "Excused": [3364], "Yea": [3379, 3384, 3391, 3397, 3430, 3450, 3453, 3363]}}]}
