Section 2. There is hereby appropriated from the state general fund to the Science and Technology Authority the sum of eight hundred thousand dollars ($800,000) for the purpose of funding a mine closure fund which is to be included as a part of an agreement between the owners of the former Homestake Mine and the authority whereby the owners will agree to convey portions of the former mine to the authority, and the authority will agree to contribute to the creation of a mine closure fund.

Section 7. Whereas, this Act is necessary for the support of the state government and its existing public institutions, an emergency is hereby declared to exist, and this Act shall be in full force and effect from and after its passage and approval."}, {"bill_id": 19045, "bill_version_id": 101010, "bill_version": "Enrolled", "bill_version_date": "2004-02-10T08:14:17-06:00", "bill_text": ""}], "amendments":
