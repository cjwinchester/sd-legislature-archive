An application for a license shall be made upon a form prescribed by the secretary and shall set forth the name under which the applicant transacts or intends to transact business, the location of the place of business, and such other information as the secretary may require. The application shall be signed by the owner, if a natural person; in the case of an association or partnership, by a member or partner thereof; or in the case of a corporation or a municipality, by an executive officer thereof or some person specifically authorized by the corporation or the municipality to sign the application, to which shall be attached the written evidence of the person's authority. Section 13. The secretary shall grant and issue to each applicant a telecommunications gross receipts tax license.

Any license issued is valid and effective without further payment of fees until canceled or revoked. Section 14. The secretary may refuse to issue a telecommunications gross receipts tax license to any person who is delinquent in payment of other taxes levied by the State of South Dakota.

Section 15. Any person who is the holder of a telecommunications gross receipts tax license or is a telecommunications company whose receipts are subject to telecommunications gross receipts tax in this state shall file a return and remit the tax on or before the twentieth day of the month following each monthly period. If the telecommunications company files the return and remits the tax by electronic transfer to the state, the telecommunications company shall file the return and remit the tax on or before the last day of the month following each monthly period. The secretary may grant an extension of not more than five days for filing a return and remittance. Unless an extension is granted, penalty or interest under \u00a7 10-59-6 shall be paid if a return or remittance is not made on time. Section 16. Any telecommunications company that is the holder of a telecommunications gross receipts tax license and that has failed to file a return, or that has filed a return and has failed to pay the tax due the state under this law on or before the fifteenth of the second month following the reporting period authorized, may no longer continue as a telecommunications company and its telecommunications gross receipts tax license is hereby revoked and canceled. Section 17. Any appeal from a decision of the secretary in a contested case shall be taken in accordance with chapter 1-26. Section 18. The secretary may not reinstate the license of a telecommunications company, which has been canceled or revoked as provided in this Act, until all the telecommunications gross receipts tax due the state and a ten dollar reinstatement fee has been paid. The secretary may also require the telecommunications company to file a bond as security for any future liability. Section 19. Any refund or allowance made by any telecommunication service or any amount written off the books of a telecommunications company reporting financial information on an accrual basis may be reported as an uncollectible debt and deducted from the gross receipts of any telecommunications service. If any uncollectible debt is subsequently collected, the amount is subject to the telecommunications gross receipts tax and shall be reported to the department in the month of collection. Section 20. Any telecommunications company subject to the telecommunications gross receipts tax shall keep records of all receipts and telecommunications service sales. The records shall, at all times during business hours of the day, be subject to inspection by the department to determine the amount of tax due. The records shall be preserved for a period of three years unless the secretary, in writing, authorized their destruction or disposal at an earlier date. Section 21. The secretary may promulgate rules pursuant to chapter 1-26 concerning: (1) Telecommunications tax licensing, including bonding and filing license applications; (2) The filing of returns and payment of the tax; (3) Determining the application of the telecommunications tax and exemptions; (4) Taxpayer record-keeping requirements; (5) Determining auditing methods. Section 22. Any person who: (1) Makes any false or fraudulent return in attempting to defeat or evade the telecommunications gross receipts tax is guilty of a Class 6 felony; (2) Fails to pay the telecommunications gross receipts tax due under this Act within thirty days from the date the tax becomes due is guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor; (3) Fails to keep the records required by this Act or refuses to exhibit these records to the department for the purpose of examination is guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor; (4) Fails to file a return required by this Act within thirty days from the date the return is due is guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor; (5) Engages in business as a telecommunications company under this Act without obtaining a telecommunications gross receipts tax license is guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor; (6) Engages in business as a telecommunications company under this Act after the company's telecommunications gross receipts tax license has been revoked or canceled by the secretary is guilty of a Class 6 felony; (7) Willfully violates any rule of the secretary for the administration and enforcement of the provisions of this Act is guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor; (8) Violates either subdivision (2) or subdivision (4) two or more times in any twelve-month period is guilty of a Class 6 felony; (9) Engages in business as a telecommunications company under this Act without obtaining a telecommunications gross receipts tax license after having been notified in writing by the secretary that the telecommunications company is subject to the provisions of this Act is guilty of a Class 6 felony. However, it is not a violation of this subdivision if the telecommunications company providing any telecommunications service files an application for a telecommunications gross receipts tax license and meets all lawful prerequisites for obtaining such license within three days from receipt of written notice from the secretary. For purposes of this section, the term, telecommunications company, includes corporate officers having control, supervision of or charged with the responsibility for making tax returns or payments pursuant to this Act. Section 23. If a corporation subject to the gross receipts tax under this Act fails for any reason to file the required returns or to pay the tax due, any of its officers having control, or supervision of, or charged with the responsibility for making such returns and payments are personally liable for such failure. The dissolution of a corporation does not discharge an officer's liability for a prior failure of the corporation to make a return or remit the tax due. The sum due for such a liability may be assessed and collected as provided by law. If the corporate officers elect not to be personally liable for the failure to file the required returns or to pay the tax due, the corporation shall provide the department with a surety bond or certificate of deposit as security for payment of any tax that may become due. The bond or certificate of deposit provided for in this section shall be in an amount equal to the estimated annual gross receipts multiplied by the applicable sales or gross receipts tax rate. Section 24. The tax imposed by this Act is in lieu of all personal and real property taxes levied by the state, counties, municipalities, townships, school districts, or other political subdivisions of the state on the portion of the personal and real property of the telecommunications company which is used or intended for use in furnishing and providing telecommunications service.
