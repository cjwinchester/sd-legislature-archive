No interest may be paid on the refund amount. If electronic funds transfer is available to the secretary, the secretary shall pay the refund by electronic funds transfer if requested by the claimant. Section 8. The amounts withheld by the department in accordance with this Act shall be retained until the production has been completed and the claimant has met all the conditions of this Act, at which time all sums retained shall be paid to the claimant. Section 9. If any claim has been fraudulently presented or supported as to any item in the claim, or if the claimant fails to meet all the conditions of this Act, then the claim may be rejected in its entirety and all sums previously refunded to the claimant shall constitute a debt to the state and a lien in favor of the state upon all property and rights to property whether real or personal belonging to the claimant and may be recovered in an action of debt. Section 10. Any person, aggrieved by the denial in whole or in part of a refund claimed under this Act, may, within thirty days after service of the notice of such denial by the secretary, demand a hearing, upon notice, before the secretary. The hearing shall be conducted pursuant to chapter 1-26. Section 11. Any person, aggrieved by a decision of the secretary under this Act, may, within thirty days of receipt of written notice of the secretary's decision, make written application to the secretary for a hearing to be conducted pursuant to chapter 1-26. Hearings are to be conducted and appeals taken pursuant to the provisions of chapters 1-26 and 1-26D. A copy of the hearing examiner's proposed decision, findings of fact, and conclusions of law shall be served on all parties when furnished to the secretary. If the secretary, pursuant to chapter 1-26D, accepts the final decision of the hearing examiner, no appeal from a final decision of the secretary upon any additional tax to be paid may be taken unless any amount ordered paid by the secretary is paid or a bond filed to insure payment of the amount. However, if the final decision of the secretary, pursuant to chapter 1-26D, rejects or modifies the decision of the hearing examiner regarding the amount due, an appeal may be taken without payment of the amount ordered to be paid and without filing of a bond. If the secretary's decision is affirmed by the circuit court, no appeal may be taken unless any amount ordered to be paid by the secretary is paid or a bond is filed to insure payment of such amount. Section 12. Any amount refunded pursuant to this Act for a production that is not completed within the time frames prescribed by this Act, including any extensions granted by the secretary, shall be returned to the state without interest. Any refunded amounts not returned pursuant to this section and all sums previously refunded to the claimant constitute a debt to the state and a lien in favor of the state upon all property and rights to property whether real or personal belonging to the claimant and may be recovered in an action of debt. Section 13. This Act is repealed on June 30, 2011."}, {"bill_id": 20368, "bill_version_id": 109114, "bill_version": "Enrolled", "bill_version_date": "2006-02-21T15:52:26-06:00", "bill_text": ""}], "amendments":
