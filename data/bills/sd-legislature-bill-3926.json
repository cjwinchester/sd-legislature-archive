Each school bus used for the transportation of school children which is owned by a school district, a nonpublic school or alternative education program or privately owned and operated under a contract with a school board or nonpublic school or alternative instruction program shall be inspected before the beginning of each school year by a representative of an inspector approved by the Division of Highway Patrol pursuant to \u00a7 13-29-6.1 to certify that the vehicle complies with state law, and rules of the South Dakota Board of Education, the Department of Public Safety, and the Division of Highway Patrol.

The owner of any bus certified by a dealer shall have the bus inspected by the Division of Highway Patrol an approved inspector before the beginning of the next school year. The owner of the bus shall display a certificate certifying that the school bus has successfully passed inspection issued by the Division of Highway Patrol or the dealer in a form prescribed by the Division of Highway Patrol in the vehicle above the windshield.
