Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of South Dakota: Section 1. That \u00a7 13-28-37 be AMENDED: 13-28-37. Any student in grades nine, ten, eleven, or twelve may apply to an institution of higher education or a technical college as a special student in a course or courses offered at the institution of higher education or technical college. The institution of higher education or technical college shall set admission standards and tuition rates. The student shall obtain the school district's approval of the postsecondary course prior to enrolling. If the student is enrolled in a nonpublic school or a tribal school, the student must obtain approval of the postsecondary course from the nonpublic school or the tribal school prior to enrolling, and if the student is receiving alternative instruction pursuant to \u00a7 13-27-3, the student must obtain approval of the postsecondary course prior to enrolling from the provider of the alternative instruction. If approved, the student shall must receive full credit toward high school graduation as well as postsecondary credit for each postsecondary course. The school district shall record each course under this section on the student's transcript and shall use each course score to calculate academic standing. The Board of Education Standards shall establish, through rules promulgated pursuant to chapter 1-26, a uniform method for school districts to calculate the amount of high school credit that a student receives for completing a postsecondary course. If a failing final course grade is received in a postsecondary course under this section, the student receiving the failure is no longer eligible to enroll for postsecondary courses under this section absent a showing of good cause."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": []}
