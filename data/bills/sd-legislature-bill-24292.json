Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of South Dakota: Section 1. That \u00a7 24-15A-32 be AMENDED: 24-15A-32. Each inmate sentenced to a penitentiary term, except those under a sentence of life or death, or determined to be ineligible for parole as authorized in \u00a7 24-15A-32.1, or under section 5 of this Act, shall have an initial parole date set by the department. This date shall be calculated by applying the percentage indicated in the following grid to the full term minus any suspended time of the inmate's sentence pursuant to \u00a7 22-6-1. The following crimes or an attempt to commit, or a conspiracy to commit, or a solicitation to commit, any of the following crimes shall be considered a violent crime for purposes of setting an initial parole date: murder, manslaughter, rape, aggravated assault, riot, robbery, burglary in the first degree, burglary in the second degree if committed before July 1, 2006, arson, kidnapping, felony sexual contact as defined in \u00a7 22-22-7, child abuse, felony sexual contact as defined in \u00a7 22-22-7.2, felony stalking as defined in \u00a7\u00a7 22-19A-2 and 22-19A-3, photographing a child in an obscene act, felony assault as defined in \u00a7\u00a7 22-18-26 and 22-18-29, felony simple assault as defined in \u00a7 22-18-1, aggravated criminal battery of an unborn child as defined in \u00a7 22-18-1.3, aggravated battery of an infant as defined in \u00a7 22-18-1.4, assault with intent to cause serious permanent disfigurement as defined in \u00a7 22-18-1.5, commission of a felony while armed as defined in \u00a7 22-14-12, discharging a firearm at an occupied structure or motor vehicle as defined in \u00a7 22-14-20, discharging a firearm from a moving vehicle as defined in \u00a7 22-14-21, criminal pedophilia, threatening to commit a sexual offense as defined in \u00a7 22-22-45, abuse or neglect of a disabled adult as defined in \u00a7 22-46-2, and aggravated incest as defined in \u00a7\u00a7 22-22A-3 and 22-22A-3.1: Felony Convictions Felony Class First Second Third Nonviolent Class 6 .25 .30 .40 Class 5 .25 .35 .40 Class 4 .25 .35 .40 Class 3 .30 .40 .50 Class 2 .30 .40 .50 Class 1 .35 .40 .50 Class C .35 .40 .50 Violent Class 6 .35 .45 .55 Class 5 .40 .50 .60 Class 4 .40 .50 .65 Class 3 .50 .60 .70 Class 2 .50 .65 .75 Class 1 .50 .65 .75 Class C .50 .65 .75 Class B 1.0 1.0 1.0 Class A 1.0 1.0 1.0 The application of the violent or nonviolent column of the grid is based on whether the inmate's current sentence is for a violent or nonviolent crime. Any prior felony shall be considered regardless of whether it is violent or nonviolent when determining which percentage to apply to the inmate's parole date calculation. Each inmate shall serve at least sixty days prior to parole release. Inmates with life sentences are not eligible for parole except as provided in \u00a7\u00a7 24-15A-55 to 24-15A-68, inclusive. An initial parole date through the application of this grid may be applied to a life sentence only after the sentence is commuted to a term of years. A Class A or B felony commuted to a number of years shall be applied to the Class C violent column of the grid. An inmate convicted of a Class A or B felony who was a juvenile at the time of the offense and receives a sentence of less than life shall be applied to the Class C violent column of the grid. Section 2. That \u00a7 32-23-4.6 be AMENDED: 32-23-4.6. If a conviction for a violation of \u00a7 32-23-1 is for a fourth offense, the person is guilty of a Class 5 felony, and the court, in pronouncing sentence, shall must revoke the person's driver license for a period of not less than two years from the date sentence is imposed or two years from the date of initial release from imprisonment, whichever is later. If the person is returned to imprisonment prior to the completion of the period of driver's license revocation, time spent imprisoned does not count toward fulfilling the period of revocation. If the person is convicted of driving without a license during that period, the court shall must sentence the person to the county jail for not less than twenty days, which sentence may not be suspended. Notwithstanding \u00a7 23A-27-19, the court retains jurisdiction to modify the conditions of the license revocation for the term of such revocation. Upon the successful completion of a court-approved chemical dependency counseling program, and proof of financial responsibility pursuant to \u00a7 32-35-113, the court may permit the person to operate a vehicle for the purposes of employment, 24/7 sobriety testing, attendance at school, child care delivery or pickup, or attendance at counseling programs. Further, sentencing pursuant to this section includes the provisions of \u00a7 23A-27-18. If a person is convicted of a fourth violation of \u00a7 32-23-1, the court must sentence the person to at least one year in a state correctional facility. The court may not suspend this sentence. Section 3. That \u00a7 32-23-4.7 be AMENDED: 32-23-4.7. If a conviction for violation of \u00a7 32-23-1 is for a fifth offense, or subsequent offenses thereafter, the person is guilty of a Class 4 felony and the court, in pronouncing sentencing, shall must revoke the person's driver license for a period of not less than three years from the date sentence is imposed or three years from the date of initial release from imprisonment, whichever is later. In the event the person is returned to imprisonment prior to the completion of the period of driver's license revocation, time spent imprisoned does not count toward fulfilling the period of revocation. If the person is convicted of driving without a license during that period, the court shall must sentence the person to the county jail for not less than twenty days, which sentence may not be suspended. Notwithstanding \u00a7 23A-27-19, the court retains jurisdiction to modify the conditions of the license revocation for the term of such revocation. Upon the successful completion of a court-approved chemical dependency counseling program, and proof of financial responsibility pursuant to \u00a7 32-35-113, the court may permit the person to operate a vehicle for the purposes of employment, 24/7 sobriety testing, attendance at school, child care delivery or pickup, or attendance at counseling programs. If a person is convicted of a fifth or subsequent violation of \u00a7 32-23-1, the court must sentence the person to at least three years in a state correctional facility. The court may not suspend this sentence. Section 4. That \u00a7 32-23-4.9 be AMENDED: 32-23-4.9. If a conviction for a violation of \u00a7 32-23-1 is for a sixth offense, or subsequent offense, and the person had at least five convictions of \u00a7 32-23-1 occurring within twenty-five years of the violation being charged, and at least two of those prior convictions having occurred within ten years, the violation is an aggravated offense and the person is guilty of a Class 4 felony. If a person is convicted of an aggravated violation of \u00a7 32-23-1 and the person has at least six convictions of \u00a7 32-23-1 occurring within fifteen years of the violation being charged, the court must sentence the person to at least five years in a state correctional facility. The court may not suspend this sentence. The court, in pronouncing sentencing, shall revoke the person's driver license for a period of not less than three years from the date the sentence is imposed or three years from the date of initial release from imprisonment, whichever is later. If the person is returned to imprisonment prior to the completion of the period of driver license revocation, time spent imprisoned does not count toward fulfilling the period of revocation. If the person is convicted of driving without a license during that period, the court shall must sentence the person to the county jail for not less than twenty days, which sentence may not be suspended. Notwithstanding \u00a7 23A-27-19, the court retains jurisdiction to modify the conditions of the license revocation for the term of such revocation. Upon the person's successful completion of a court-approved chemical dependency counseling program and proof of financial responsibility pursuant to \u00a7 32-35-113, the court may permit the person to operate a vehicle for the purposes of employment, 24/7 sobriety testing, attendance at school, child care delivery or pickup, or attendance at counseling programs. For each person convicted under this section and placed on probation, parole, or released from prison due to a suspended sentence, the person's supervision must include at least one of the following: enrollment in an alcohol or drug accountability program, an ignition interlock, a breath alcohol interlock, an alcohol monitoring bracelet, or another enhanced monitoring tool. The Unified Judicial System shall oversee supervision of the offender if the sentence does not include a term of imprisonment in the penitentiary. The Department of Corrections shall oversee supervision of the offender if the sentence includes a term of imprisonment in the penitentiary. Any offender supervised pursuant to this section is not excluded from earned discharge credit as otherwise authorized by statute. If, during the period of supervision imposed under this section, the person being supervised violates conditions, the person must be penalized according to the graduated sanctions policy to be established by the Supreme Court or the Department of Corrections, respectively.
