Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of South Dakota: Section 1. That \u00a7 43-17-30 be AMENDED. 43-17-30. Powers of Department of Game, Fish and Parks. Nothing in \u00a7\u00a7 43-17-2, 43-17-20, 43-17-21, and 43-17-27 to 43-17-29, inclusive, diminishes any power of the Department of Game, Fish and Parks to administer, control, or otherwise regulate any lands or interest in lands within its jurisdiction. The secretary of the department may close a portion of a meandered body of water to public use for a period of up to two years to protect the privacy, safety, or substantially affected agricultural financial interests of an owner of private property adjacent to a meandered body of water. The restriction on public use must be narrowly tailored to serve the owner's interests. The decision of the secretary may be renewed as many times as the secretary determines to be appropriate. A party may petition the Game, Fish and Parks Commission to review a decision of the secretary to close a portion of a meandered body of water. The commission may affirm, modify, or reverse the decision of the secretary. A decision not to close a portion of a meandered body of water is not subject to review. No decision of the secretary or the commission made pursuant to this section is quasi-judicial. Section 2. That \u00a7 43-17-29 be AMENDED. 43-17-29. Public rights in lake above high water mark. If any water level rises above the ordinary high water mark of a navigable meandered lake, the right of the public to enjoyment of the entire lake may not be limited, except that access to the lake shall be by public right\u2011of\u2011way or by permission of the riparian landowner and is subject to \u00a7\u00a7 \u00a7 43-17-2, 43-17-31, 43-17-32, and 43-17-33. Section 3. That \u00a7 43-17-2 be AMENDED. 43-17-2. Upland owner taking to edge of navigable lake or stream at low\u2011water mark--Exception--Navigable rivers and lakes as public highways. Unless the grant under which the land is held indicates a different intent, the owner of the upland, if it borders upon a navigable lake or stream, takes to the edge of the lake or stream at low water mark. All navigable rivers and meandered lakes are public highways within fifty feet landward from the water's nearest edge, provided that the outer boundary of such public highway may not expand beyond the ordinary high water mark and may not contract within the ordinary low water mark, and subject to \u00a7\u00a7 \u00a7 43-17-29, 43-17-31, 43-17-32, and 43-17-33. Section 4. That \u00a7 43-17-31 be REPEALED. 43-17-31. Landowner's right to deny public access to taxable property--Department to clearly mark certain inundated property--Exception. Section 5. That \u00a7 43-17-32 be REPEALED. 43-17-32. Landowner's right to deny state agency use of taxable property--Conditions for public access--Exceptions. Section 6.
