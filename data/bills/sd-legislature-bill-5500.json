BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That chapter 3-12 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: A contributing member who becomes disabled and who has acquired at least three years of contributory service or noncontributory service as delineated in subsections (b), (e), (g), and (h) of subdivision 3-12-47(24) since the member's most recent entry into active status and prior to becoming disabled, or was disabled by accidental means while performing usual duties for an employer, is eligible for disability benefits if the disability is expected to be of long, continued, and indefinite duration of at least one year and the member is disabled on the date the member's contributory service ends. For purposes of this section, a transfer within a participating unit, or a change in employment from one participating unit to another participating unit if there is no break in contributory service, does not constitute a new entry into active status. The provisions of this section apply to any member whose application for disability benefits is received by the system after June 30, 2015. Section 2. That chapter 3-12 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Any member seeking disability benefits pursuant to section 1 of this Act shall submit an application to the administrator. Any information required for a complete application must be received within one year after the application for disability benefits was received. If the required information is not received by the system within one year after the application is received, the member may reapply. Any member, who fails to file an application for disability benefits with the administrator within three years after the date on which the member's contributory service ends, forfeits all rights to disability benefits. Section 3. That chapter 3-12 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: No application for disability benefits pursuant to section 1 of this Act may be determined until the member's employer has certified to the system that, within the employer's understanding of the member's medical condition and the employer's knowledge of the member's employment requirements and duties, the employer is unable to provide to the member either effective accommodations in the member's current position or employment in a comparable level position. Section 4. That chapter 3-12 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: No application for disability benefits pursuant to section 1 of this Act may be determined until a health care provider has certified to the system that the employee has a disability. Section 5. That chapter 3-12 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Upon receipt of an application for disability benefits after June 30, 2015, along with statements from a health care provider and the member's employer, the administrator shall determine whether the member is eligible for disability benefits. The administrator may request the advice of the disability advisory committee with respect to any application. The recommendation of the disability advisory committee is not binding on the administrator. The disability advisory committee or the administrator may require an independent medical examination of the member to be conducted by a disinterested health care provider selected by the disability advisory committee or the administrator to evaluate the member's condition. The disability advisory committee or the administrator may require a functional capacity assessment of the member to be conducted by a licensed professional qualified to administer such assessments, and the assessment may be used to evaluate the member's qualification for benefits. Refusal to undergo an examination or assessment pursuant to this section is cause for denying the application. If the administrator determines that the member is not disabled, a notice of the administrator's determination and the reasons for the determination shall be sent, certified mail, to the member's last known address. Section 6. That chapter 3-12 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: If the administrator determines that the member whose application was received pursuant to section 5 of this Act, meets the qualifications to receive disability benefits, a notice of the administrator's determination shall be sent, certified mail, to the member's last known address. A member whose application for disability benefits is approved shall receive the benefits beginning with the month following the date on which the member's contributory service terminates. If any member fails to terminate contributory service within one year after receiving notice that the member's application has been approved, the member's application approval expires. Section 7. That chapter 3-12 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: The disability benefit approved pursuant to section 6 of this Act is the greater of the following calculations: (1) Twenty-five percent of the member's final average compensation at the date of disability; or (2) The member's unreduced accrued retirement benefit at the date of disability. The disability benefit shall be paid in monthly installments for the life of the member unless the benefit terminates pursuant to section 11 of this Act. For purposes of determining the eligibility of a surviving spouse benefit, the disability benefit is considered a retirement benefit when the member attains the age of sixty-five. Section 8. That chapter 3-12 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: No member may receive credited service for the period during which the member receives disability benefits pursuant to section 7 of this Act. Section 9. That chapter 3-12 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: If a member receiving disability benefits pursuant to section 7 of this Act becomes employed by a participating unit, the member and employer shall make active contributions pursuant to \u00a7 3-12-71 during the period of the employment. The contributions required of the member pursuant to \u00a7 3-12-71 shall be deposited by the member's employer with the system for the benefit of the member to be transferred to an account within the deferred compensation program established pursuant to chapter 3-13. The contributions shall be governed by \u00a7 457 of the Internal Revenue Code. Notwithstanding the provisions of \u00a7 3-12-71, the contributions required of the member's employer pursuant to \u00a7 3-12-71 shall be deposited into the member trust fund created by chapter 3-12, but without any association with or credit to the member. Section 10. That chapter 3-12 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: A member's disability benefits pursuant to section 7 of this Act terminate if the member is no longer disabled, as certified by a health care provider. Upon receipt of certification the administrator shall determine whether the member meets the qualifications for disability benefits. In making this determination the administrator shall follow the same procedure used in making the initial determination of disability provided in section 5 of this Act. A member's disability benefits shall be suspended and subject to termination if the member refuses to undergo an examination or assessment requested by the disability advisory committee or the administrator. If the administrator finds that the member no longer meets the qualifications for disability benefits, the administrator shall notify the member of this finding by certified mail and the payment of disability benefits shall terminate thirty days after receipt of the notice. Such a finding by the administrator is subject to appeal and review as a contested case. Section 11. That chapter 3-12 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: If a member's disability benefits pursuant to section 7 of this Act have terminated and the member returns to covered employment, the member and employer shall make contributions pursuant to \u00a7 3-12-71. Section 12. That chapter 3-12 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Upon retirement, a member who received disability benefits pursuant to section 7 of this Act and whose benefits were terminated and who returned to covered employment shall receive a retirement benefit based on the member's credited service prior to receiving disability benefits and after receiving disability benefits.

Section 13. That chapter 3-12 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Upon retirement, a member who received disability benefits pursuant to section 7 of this Act and whose benefits were terminated and who did not return to covered employment shall receive a retirement benefit based on the member's credited service prior to receiving disability benefits.

The monthly amount of the family benefit is the amount of the monthly disability benefits the member received prior to death. The monthly family benefit shall be equally apportioned among any children of the member and shall be paid on behalf of any child to the conservator or custodian of the child, as applicable. However, if the child is eighteen years of age the benefit is payable directly to the child. As any child becomes ineligible pursuant to subdivision 3-12-47(14), the family benefit shall be reallocated among any remaining children of the deceased member. The family benefit terminates if there are no children of the deceased member pursuant to subdivision 3-12-47(14). Section 15. That chapter 3-12 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: If no family benefit is being paid pursuant to section 14 of this Act, a surviving spouse of a member who received disability benefits pursuant to section 7 of this Act shall, upon attaining the age of sixty-five, receive a monthly benefit, payable for the life of the surviving spouse, equal to one of the following calculations, whichever is applicable: (1) If there was a family benefit paid, sixty percent of the family benefit paid at the time the family benefit ended, increased by the improvement factor from the date the last family benefit was paid; or (2) If there was no family benefit paid, sixty percent of the deceased member's disability benefit paid at the time of the member's death, increased by the improvement factor from the date of the member's death.

No report or return need be filed for the calendar year in which the member dies or converts to a normal or early retirement benefit under this chapter. The disability allowance benefit of any member failing to file a report or return as required in this section shall be suspended until the report or return is filed. The reduction may occur, however, only if a disability allowance benefit is being paid by the system, but may not reduce the disability allowance benefit below the minimum provided for in \u00a7 3-12-99. For members with a disability in effect before July 1, 1995, the first report is due on or before May 31, 1996. This section applies to any member receiving or entitled to receive a disability allowance benefit pursuant to this chapter \u00a7 3-12-98. Section 34. That ARSD 62:01:02:06 be amended to read as follows: 62:01:02:06. Refund of active contributions made during period of disability -- Granted credited service. If a disabled member receiving credited service pursuant to SDCL 3-12-103 and \u00a7 62:01:04:05.01 becomes employed by a member employer unit, the member and employer shall make active contributions during the period of such employment pursuant to SDCL 3-12-71. Upon the member's conversion of disabled status to retired status, upon the member's termination of disabled status or upon the member's termination of employment, whichever occurs first, the member may request a refund of the member's accumulated contributions made during that period when the member also was receiving credited service due to the disability. The provisions of this section apply to any member whose application for disability benefits is received by the system prior to July 1, 2015. Section 35. That ARSD chapter 62:01:04 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: 62:01:04:00. Application of chapter. The provisions of this chapter apply to any member whose application for disability benefits was received by the system prior to July 1, 2015. Section 36. That ARSD 62:01:04:02 be amended to read as follows: 62:01:04:02. Disability -- Beginning of benefits. A member whose application for a disability allowance benefit is approved shall receive the allowance benefit beginning on the first day of the month following the date on which the member's contributory service terminates. If any member fails to terminate contributory service within one year after receiving notice that the member's application has been approved, the member's application approval expires."}, {"bill_id":
