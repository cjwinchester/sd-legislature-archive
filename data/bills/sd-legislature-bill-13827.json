BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. For the purposes of this Act, a custodian is any health care provider, health care facility, or health insurer that creates, controls, or retains health care information, or any person who obtains health care information for lawful purposes. The term, custodian, includes natural persons only when acting in the course of their employment or agency. Section 2. No later than twenty days after receipt of a written request from an individual to examine or receive a copy of the individual's health care information, a custodian shall: (1) Provide a copy of the information requested to the individual or permit the individual to examine the information during regular business hours; (2) Notify the individual that: (a) The custodian does not have the information and, if known, inform the individual of the name and address of the person who has the information requested or when the information will be available; or (b) Access to the information is delayed due to unusual circumstances and the date that the information will be available or denied, which may be no later than forty days after receipt of the request; or (3) Deny the request in whole or in part if the custodian determines any of the following: (a) Knowledge of the information would adversely and substantially affect the individual's health; (b) Knowledge of the information would reasonably be expected to identify a person who provided the information in confidence and under circumstances in which confidentiality was appropriate; or (c) The information was compiled solely for litigation, law enforcement investigation, quality assurance, or peer review purposes. Section 3. If a request to examine or copy information is denied in whole or in part, the custodian shall notify the individual in writing of the reasons for the denial and the individual's rights under section 4 of this Act. To the extent possible, the information to which access has been denied shall be separated from information that may be disclosed and the individual shall be permitted to examine or copy the disclosable information. Section 4. A custodian who has denied access in whole or in part under subsection (3)(a) or (3)(b) of section 2 of this Act shall permit a health care provider selected by the individual to examine and copy the information. If the custodian denying access is a health care provider, the reviewing health care provider shall be licensed or certified to treat the individual for the same condition as the custodian denying access. If the reviewing health care provider also denies the request, the individual may petition the court for access to the health care information. The court shall resolve the matter based on criteria in subdivision (3) of section 2 of this Act. Section 5. A custodian that is a health care provider, health care facility, or health insurer shall, on reasonable request, explain any code, abbreviation, term, or notation used by that custodian in the health care information. Section 6. If a custodian does not maintain the information in the form requested by the individual, the custodian is not required to create a new record or reformulate an existing record in order to meet the request. Section 7. The custodian may charge a reasonable fee for providing requested health care information. A reasonable fee is the usual commercial rate for actual reproduction of the information. The custodian may also charge an additional fee of no more than five dollars for each hour of personnel time required to reproduce the health care information. The custodian shall provide a detailed bill accounting for the disclosure charges. Section 8. An individual may request in writing that a custodian amend the individual's health care information in order to improve the accuracy or completeness of the information, if the amendment does not delete, erase, or obliterate any of the original information. Within thirty days after receipt of a written request from an individual to amend the individual's health care information, a custodian shall do one of the following: (1) Amend the information as requested; or (2) Notify the individual that the request has been denied, the reason for the denial, and that the individual may file a concise statement of what the individual believes to be the correct information and the reasons the individual disagrees with the denial. This statement by the individual shall be retained in the health care information. For the purposes of this section, the term, amend, means to indicate one or more disputed entries in health care information or to change the entry without obliterating the original information."}, {"bill_id": 13827, "bill_version_id": 77957, "bill_version": "Senate Health and Human Services Engrossed", "bill_version_date": "1998-02-09T00:00:00-06:00", "bill_text": "FOR AN ACT ENTITLED, An Act to provide certain requirements for new continuing care retirement communities.
