However, no school district is required to maintain its permanent school records on microfilm if the district maintains its permanent school records in an electronic format that can be used to produce clear, accurate reproductions of the originals. Any record made open to the public pursuant to this chapter shall be maintained in its original format or in any searchable and reproducible electronic or other format. This chapter does not mandate that any record or document be kept in a particular format nor does it require that a record be provided to the public in any format or media other than that in which it is stored.

A photographic, microphotographic, or microfilm copy of any such record, or a certified copy thereof, shall be admissible as evidence in any court or proceeding and it shall have the same force and effect as though the original record has been produced and proved.

That \u00a7 23-5-11 be amended to read as follows: 23-5-11. The provisions of \u00a7 1-27-1 do not apply to confidential criminal justice information. Confidential criminal justice information and criminal history information are specifically exempt from disclosure pursuant to this Act and may be withheld by the lawful custodian of the records. Information about calls for service revealing the date, time, and general location and general subject matter of the call is not confidential criminal justice information and may be released to the public, at the discretion of the executive of the law enforcement agency involved, unless the information contains intelligence or identity information that would jeopardize an ongoing investigation. The provisions of this section do not supersede more specific provisions regarding public access or confidentiality elsewhere in state or federal law. Section 19. That chapter 1-27 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: The secretary of corrections may prohibit the release of information to inmates or their agents regarding correctional operations, department policies and procedures, and inmate records of the requesting inmate or other inmates if the release would jeopardize the safety or security of a person, the operation of a correctional facility, or the safety of the public.
