No collective bargaining agreement between a district and the district's teachers may limit the ability of a teacher to qualify for or receive an incentive reward. Nothing in sections 1 to 6, inclusive, of this Act is intended to create a contractual right or property right in the math and science teacher incentive program. Section 3. The Department of Education shall provide application forms for teachers wishing to participate in the math and science teacher incentive program. A teacher wishing to participate in the program shall complete and sign the form and provide the form to the business office of the school district by the close of business on October first to be eligible for the program for that school year. A teacher wishing to participate shall submit a new application for each school year. Completed applications are a public record pursuant to chapter 1-27, but personal information in the applications may be redacted as allowed by that chapter. Section 4. To be eligible for the math and science teacher incentive program, a teacher shall fulfill the following requirements: (1) Comply with section 3 of this Act; (2) Be assigned to teach math or science courses, or a combination of such courses, in middle school or high school for at least fifty-one percent of a full-time equivalent position's assignments submitted in the annual teacher data collection pursuant to \u00a7 13-3-51 and any rules promulgated pursuant to that section; and (3) Be currently certified with a middle school or high school endorsement to teach each math and science course.

Participation in the top teachers reward program is voluntary, and such rewards shall supplement but not replace what a teacher receives under a contract between the teacher and the school district or a collective bargaining agreement between a district and the district's teachers. No collective bargaining agreement between a district and the district's teachers may limit the ability of a teacher to qualify for or receive a top teacher reward. Nothing in sections 7 to 15, inclusive, of this Act is intended to create a contractual right or property right in the top teachers reward program. Section 9. In each school year, up to twenty percent of each school district's full-time equivalent certified teaching positions, as measured by the district's annual teacher data collection pursuant to \u00a7 13-3-51 and any rules promulgated pursuant to that section, shall be eligible to receive a top teacher reward, subject to the requirements of this Act. The Department of Education shall multiply the number of full-time equivalent certified teaching positions in the district by twenty percent.

Any funds not distributed according to this subdivision shall be returned to the Department of Education within thirty days. Section 28. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, a public school district may create a local teacher reward plan to act as a substitute for the top teacher reward program beginning in the 2014-2015 school year. If the local teacher reward plan is developed in compliance with sections 28 to 35, inclusive, of this Act, the district may utilize the local teacher reward plan to provide the district with the flexibility to use the funds that would otherwise be provided to the district through the top teachers reward program. Participation in the local teacher reward plan is voluntary. Rewards shall supplement but not replace what a teacher receives under a contract between the teacher and the school district or a collective bargaining agreement between a district and the district's teachers. No collective bargaining agreement between a district and the district's teachers may limit the ability of a teacher to qualify for or receive a local teacher reward. Nothing in sections 28 to 35, inclusive, of this Act, is intended to create a contractual right or property right in local teacher rewards. Teachers in the district may not participate in the top teacher reward program for any school year for which the district has adopted a local teacher reward plan. The district shall provide written notice to each certified teacher of the teacher's ineligibility for the top teacher reward program and provide a copy of the district's local teacher reward plan to each certified teacher before executing a teaching contract with the teacher for the school year for which the local teacher reward plan is effective. Section 29. The local teacher reward plan shall reward certified teachers in the district based upon one or more of the following criteria: (1) Demonstrating an impact on student achievement; (2) Demonstrating teacher leadership; or (3) Market based needs of the school district based upon critical teaching area needs of the school district.

Beginning in the 2014-2015 school year, there is hereby created the top teachers reward program within the Department of Education to provide funds to public school districts for the purpose of providing top teacher rewards for certified teachers. Section 18. Participation in the top teachers reward program is voluntary for teachers, and such rewards shall supplement but not replace what a teacher receives under a contract between the teacher and the school district or a collective bargaining agreement between a district and the district's teachers. No collective bargaining agreement between a district and the district's teachers may limit the ability of a teacher to qualify for or receive a top teacher reward.

The Department of Education shall multiply the number of full-time equivalent certified teaching positions in the district by twenty percent. If this calculation results in a fraction, the maximum number of eligible positions may not exceed the next lowest whole number. If there are fewer than five full-time equivalent certified teaching positions in a school district, the maximum number of eligible positions shall be one. Section 20. No later than May first of each year, at the same time that foundation program state aid is distributed to a school district pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 13-13-10.1 to 13-13-41, inclusive, the secretary of the Department of Education shall inform each school district of the number of eligible positions in that district for the current school year, based on the calculation in section 19 of this Act, and distribute to each school district five thousand seven hundred dollars per eligible position.

No later than September first of each year, the school district shall distribute the funds received pursuant to section 20 of this Act as follows: (1) Five thousand dollars shall be paid to each teacher selected for a top teacher reward pursuant to section 24 of this Act for the previous school year; and (2) Seven hundred dollars may be retained by the district to pay the district's share of applicable federal taxes, the district's share of contribution to the South Dakota Retirement System, and administrative costs. Any funds received pursuant to section 20 of this Act which are not distributed according to this section shall be returned to the Department of Education within thirty days. Section 22. The Department of Education shall provide application forms for teachers wishing to participate in the top teachers reward program. A teacher wishing to participate in the program shall complete and sign the form and provide the form to the business office of the school district by the close of business on October first to be eligible for the program for that school year.

A participating teacher shall be full-time and receive a distinguished rating, as referenced in section 38 of this Act, on the teacher's most recent evaluation to be eligible for a top teacher reward. In addition, a distinguished teacher's selection for the reward may be based on consideration of the following factors as determined by the school board: (1) Mentoring of less experienced teachers; (2) Curriculum development; (3) Assessment development; (4) Data analysis; (5) Service to the local district, state, or national committees or task forces; (6) Leadership in a professional learning community; (7) National board certification; (8) Other leadership activities or recognitions; and (9) Other additional criteria as determined by the school board. Section 24. No later than August first of each year, the school board of each school district shall determine which participating teachers, if any, are selected to receive top teacher rewards for the previous school year according to the criteria in section 23 of this Act. The number of teachers selected may not exceed the number of eligible positions referenced in sections 19 and 20 of this Act. Section 25. Department of Education may require each school district to provide any information necessary to verify the district's compliance with sections 20 to 24, inclusive, of this Act. Upon a finding of noncompliance, the department may require the district to return any funds distributed contrary to the requirements of this Act. Section 26. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Act, public school districts may opt out of the top teacher reward program by providing written notice to the Department of Education. The notice shall be approved by a majority of the school board and signed by the school board president. The department shall provide forms for this purpose. Beginning in 2014, the notice shall be postmarked no earlier than January first, and no later than January thirty-first, of each year in order to be effective for the next school year. The district shall provide a separate form for each school year for which the district desires to opt out. If a school district fails to follow the requirements of this section, the attempt to opt out is void, and the district shall comply with the requirements of the top teacher reward program. If a district opts out pursuant to this section, the teachers employed in the district are not eligible to participate in the top teacher reward program. The district shall provide written notice to each certified teacher of the teacher's ineligibility for the program before executing a teaching contract with the teacher for the school year for which the opt out is effective. School districts may not opt out of the math and science teacher incentive program established pursuant to this Act. Section 27. If a school district opts out pursuant to section 26 of this Act, all funds which the district would have been eligible to receive for the top teacher program pursuant to this Act shall be redistributed as follows: (1) To obtain the redistribution amount, the Department of Education shall calculate the number of positions that would have been eligible for the top teacher reward program in each opt out district pursuant to section 19 of this Act, and multiply that calculation by five thousand seven hundred dollars; (2) No later than May first of each year, at the same time that foundation program state aid is distributed to a school district pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 13-13-10.1 to 13-13-41, inclusive, the department shall allocate the redistribution amount, on a pro rata basis, to each public school district that did not opt out of the top teacher reward program or is participating in a local teacher reward program pursuant to sections 28 to 35, inclusive, of this Act. Each district's pro rata share of the redistribution amount shall be based on the number of full-time equivalent certified teacher positions in the district, as measured by the district's annual teacher data collection pursuant to \u00a7 13-3-51 and any rules promulgated pursuant to that section; and (3) No later than September first of each year, the redistribution amount received by each district pursuant to subdivision (2) shall be distributed equally among all teachers receiving top teacher rewards in the district pursuant to sections 17 to 25, inclusive, of this Act, or among all teachers receiving local teacher rewards pursuant to sections 28 to 35, inclusive, of this Act, but each district may withhold an amount necessary to pay the district's share of applicable federal taxes, the district's share of contributions to the South Dakota Retirement System, and administrative costs. Any funds not distributed according to this subdivision shall be returned to the Department of Education within thirty days. Section 28. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, a public school district may create a local teacher reward plan to act as a substitute for the top teacher reward program beginning in the 2014-2015 school year. If the local teacher reward plan is developed in compliance with sections 28 to 35, inclusive, of this Act, the district may utilize the local teacher reward plan to provide the district with the flexibility to use the funds that would otherwise be provided to the district through the top teachers reward program. Participation in the local teacher reward plan is voluntary. Rewards shall supplement but not replace what a teacher receives under a contract between the teacher and the school district or a collective bargaining agreement between a district and the district's teachers. No collective bargaining agreement between a district and the district's teachers may limit the ability of a teacher to qualify for or receive a local teacher reward. Nothing in sections 28 to 35, inclusive, of this Act, is intended to create a contractual right or property right in local teacher rewards. Teachers in the district may not participate in the top teacher reward program for any school year for which the district has adopted a local teacher reward plan. The district shall provide written notice to each certified teacher of the teacher's ineligibility for the top teacher reward program and provide a copy of the district's local teacher reward plan to each certified teacher before executing a teaching contract with the teacher for the school year for which the local teacher reward plan is effective.
