Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of South Dakota: Section 1. That \u00a7 12-4-9 be AMENDED: 12-4-9. The county auditor shall maintain and safeguard a file of voters in computer format that contains the information of each person registered in each voting precinct within the county. This file shall be known as the master registration file and shall be, at all times during office hours, open to public inspection. However, public access to social security numbers, driver license numbers, and dates of birth contained in the master registration file is prohibited. The master registration file shall must contain all information from each voter's registration card. The master registration file shall must also include the date of the last election the voter has voted in and when the voter's information was last updated. The master registration file may also contain additional voter history information. Any voter registration form for a purged or unregistered voter shall must be kept for twenty-two months. No purged or unregistered voter may be included in the master registration file. The master registration file must be updated twice each year, including no less than sixty days prior to a general election. Section 2. That chapter 12-4 be amended with a NEW SECTION: If the county auditor has reason to believe that a person no longer resides at the person's registered address, the auditor shall mail a notice to that person requesting confirmation that the person still resides at the person's registered address. The county auditor shall remove the person from the master registration file if the person fails to: (1) Respond to the notice and vote in the registered precinct at least once during a period of four consecutive years covering two general federal elections; or (2) Update the voter's registration with the auditor and vote at least once during a period of four consecutive years covering two general federal elections. The secretary of state, pursuant to chapter 1-26 and in compliance with federal law, shall prescribe by rule the means to remove a person from the master registration list pursuant to this section and create the confirmation notice that is sent to a registered voter before removal."}], "amendments": [{"bill_id": 23360, "document_id": 233792, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/233792.pdf", "legislator_profile_id": 3940, "document_id_instructions": 233797, "document_id_instructions_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/233797.pdf"}], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 23360, "action_date": "2022-02-02T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 231864, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/231864.pdf", "status_text": "First read in Senate and referred to", "journal_page": 161, "committee_id_action": 1034, "committee_id_assigned": 1035, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 23360, "action_date": "2022-02-16T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 233046, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/233046.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 1, "committee_id_action": 1035, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 23360, "action_date": "2022-02-16T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 233047, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/233047.pdf", "status_text": "Motion to amend", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 1035, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 23360, "action_date": "2022-02-16T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 233047, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/233047.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to the 41st legislative day", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 1035, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 73946, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [3993, 3935, 3925, 3936, 3994, 3990, 3949, 3932, 3921]}}]}
