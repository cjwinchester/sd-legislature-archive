For taxes payable in 2009 2010 and each year thereafter, the levy for the general fund of a school district shall be as follows: (1) The maximum tax levy shall be eight nine dollars and seventy-eight twelve cents per thousand dollars of taxable valuation subject to the limitations on agricultural property as provided in subdivision (2) of this section, owner-occupied property as provided for in subdivision (3) of this section, and nonagricultural acreage property as provided for in subdivision (4) of this section; (2) The maximum tax levy on agricultural property for such school district shall be two three dollars and sixty-one sixty cents per thousand dollars of taxable valuation.

If the district's levies are less than the maximum levies as stated in this section, the levies shall maintain the same proportion to each other as represented in the mathematical relationship at the maximum levies. All levies in this section shall be imposed on valuations where the median level of assessment represents eighty-five percent of market value as determined by the Department of Revenue and Regulation. These valuations shall be used for all school funding purposes. If the district has imposed an excess levy pursuant to \u00a7 10-12-43, the levies shall maintain the same proportion to each other as represented in the mathematical relationship at the maximum levies in this section.

Any adjustments in the levies specified in \u00a7 10-12-42 made pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 13- 13-71 and 13-13-72 shall be based on maintaining the relationship between statewide local effort as a percentage of statewide local need in the fiscal year succeeding the fiscal year in which the adjustment is made.

In addition to the adjustments in the levies provided by this section, the levies for nonagricultural property and owner-occupied single-family dwellings shall also be adjusted as necessary to account
