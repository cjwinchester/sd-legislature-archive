BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. An interstate wildlife violator compact is entered with all states legally joining the compact in the form substantially as contained in this Act. Section 2. The Legislature of the State of South Dakota and the participating compact states find that: (1) Wildlife resources are managed in trust by the respective compact states for the benefit of all residents and visitors; (2) The protection of the wildlife resources of the compact state is materially affected by the degree of compliance with state statutes, laws, ordinances, regulations, and administrative rules relating to the management of such resources; (3) The preservation, protection, management, and restoration of wildlife contributes immeasurably to the aesthetic, recreational, and economic aspects of such natural resources; (4) Wildlife resources are valuable without regard to political boundaries; therefore, every person should be required to comply with wildlife preservation, protection, management and restoration laws, ordinances, regulations, and administrative rules of the participating compact states as a condition precedent to the continuance or issuance of any license to hunt, fish, trap, or possess wildlife; (5) Violation of wildlife laws interferes with the management of wildlife resources and may endanger the safety of persons and property; (6) The mobility of many wildlife law violators necessitates the maintenance of channels of communication among the various states; (7) In most instances, a person who is cited for a wildlife violation in a state other than that person's own state: (a) Is required to post collateral or a bond to secure appearance for a trial at a later date; (b) Is taken into custody until the collateral or bond is posted; or (c) Is taken directly to court for an immediate appearance; (8) The purpose of the enforcement practices set forth in subdivision (7) is to ensure compliance with the terms of a wildlife citation by the cited person who, if permitted to proceed after receiving the citation, could return to the person's home state and disregard the person's duty under the terms of the citation; (9) In most instances, a person receiving a wildlife citation in that person's home state is permitted to accept the citation from the officer at the scene of the violation and immediately proceed after agreeing or being instructed to comply with the terms of the citation; (10) The practices described in subdivision (7) cause unnecessary inconvenience and, at times, a hardship for the person who is unable at the time to post collateral, furnish a bond, stand trial, or pay a fine and is thus compelled to remain in custody until some alternative arrangement is made; and (11) The enforcement practices described in subdivision g consume an undue amount of law enforcement time. Section 3. It is the policy of the State of South Dakota and the participating compact states to: (1) Promote compliance with the statutes, laws, ordinances, regulations, and administrative rules relating to management of wildlife resources in their respective states; (2) Recognize the suspension of wildlife license privileges of any person whose license privileges have been suspended by a participating state and may treat such suspension as if it had occurred in their state; (3) Allow a violator, except as provided in section 7 of this Act, to accept a wildlife citation and proceed without delay, whether or not a resident of the state in which the citation was issued, if the violator's home state is party to this compact; (4) Report to the appropriate participating state, as provided in a compact manual adopted by the participating compact states, any conviction recorded against any person whose home state was not the issuing state; (5) Allow the home state to recognize and treat convictions recorded against its residents, which convictions occurred in a participating state, as though they occurred in the home state; (6) Extend cooperation to its fullest extent among the participating states for enforcing compliance with the terms of a wildlife citation issued in one participating state to a resident of another participating state; (7) Maximize effective use of law enforcement personnel and information; and (8) Assist court systems in the efficient disposition of wildlife violations. Section 4. The purpose of this Act and compact is to provide a means through which participating states may join in a reciprocal program to effectuate the policies enumerated in section 3 of this Act in a uniform and orderly manner and to provide for the fair and impartial treatment of wildlife violators operating within participating states in recognition of the violator's right to due process and the sovereign status of a participating state. Section 5. Terms used in this Act and compact mean: (1) \"Citation,\" any summons, complaint, summons and complaint, ticket, penalty assessment, or other official document that is issued to a person by a wildlife officer or other peace officer for a wildlife violation and that contains an order requiring the person to respond; (2) \"Collateral,\" any cash or other security deposited to secure an appearance for trial in connection with the issuance by a wildlife officer or other peace officer of a citation for a wildlife violation; (3) \"Compliance,\" with respect to a citation, the act of answering a citation through an appearance in a court or tribunal, or through the payment of fines, costs, and surcharges, if any; (4) \"Conviction,\" a conviction, including any court conviction, for any offense that is related to the preservation, protection, management, or restoration of wildlife and that is prohibited by state statute, law, regulation, ordinance, or administrative rule.

Section 7. Personal recognizance is acceptable: (1) If not prohibited by state or local law or the compact manual; and (2) If the violator provides adequate proof of identification to the wildlife officer.

Upon receipt of a report of conviction from the licensing authority of the issuing state, the licensing authority of the home state may enter such conviction in its records and may treat such conviction as though it occurred in the home state for the purposes of the suspension of license privileges if the violation resulting in a suspension could have been the basis for suspension of license privileges in the home state. Section 12. The licensing authority of the home state shall maintain a record of actions taken and shall make reports to issuing states as provided in the compact manual. Section 13. All participating states may recognize the suspension of license privileges of any person by any participating state as though the violation resulting in the suspension had occurred in their state and could have been the basis for suspension of license privileges in their state. Section 14. Each participating state shall communicate suspension information to other participating states in form and content as contained in the compact manual. Section 15. Except as expressly required by this compact, nothing in this compact may be construed to affect the right of any participating state to apply any of its laws relating to license privileges to any person or circumstance or to invalidate or prevent any agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a participating state and a nonparticipating state concerning wildlife law enforcement. Section 16. For the purposes of administering this Act and compact and to serve as a governing body for the resolution of all matters relating to the operation of this compact, a board of compact administrators is established. The board is composed of one representative from each of the participating states to be known as the compact administrator. The compact administrator shall be appointed by the head of the licensing authority of each participating state and serves and is subject to removal in accordance with the laws of the state that the compact administrator represents.

The board may contract with, or accept services or personnel from, any governmental or intergovernmental agency, individual, firm, or corporation, or any private nonprofit organization or institution.

All procedures and forms adopted pursuant to board action must be contained in a compact manual. Section 23. This compact becomes effective at such time as it is adopted in a substantially similar form by two or more states. Section 24.

Adoption of an amendment requires endorsement by all participating states and becomes effective thirty days after the date of the last endorsement. Section 30. Failure of a participating state to respond to the compact presiding officer within one hundred twenty days after receipt of a proposed amendment constitutes endorsement of the amendment. Section 31. This compact shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate the purposes. The provisions of this compact are severable, and if any phrase, clause, sentence, or provision of this compact is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any participating state or the United States, or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, individual, or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of the compact is not affected thereby. If this compact is held contrary to the constitution of any participating state, the compact remains in full force and effect as to the remaining states and in full force and effect as to the participating state affected as to all severable matters. Section 32.

Section 36. If the department receives notice of a conviction of a state resident from the licensing authority of the issuing state, the department may treat the conviction as if it had occurred in this state and shall determine whether the conviction could have led to the forfeiture of the resident's hunting, trapping, or fishing privileges under state law. If the department determines that the resident's privileges could have been forfeited, the department may suspend the resident's privileges to hunt, trap, or fish in this state for the same period as the issuing state, not to exceed the limit that could have been imposed under state law. Section 37. Notice of the suspension shall be sent to the person, who shall surrender any current South Dakota hunting, trapping, or fishing licenses to the department within ten days. Section 38. A person whose privileges have been suspended and who hunts, traps, or fishes in this state, who applies for or purchases any licenses or permits to hunt, trap, or fish in this state, or who refuses to surrender any current hunting, trapping, or fishing licenses as required is guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor. Section 39. The department may suspend the hunting, trapping, or fishing privileges of any resident of this state upon notification from the licensing authority of an issuing state that the resident has failed to comply with the terms of a citation issued for a wildlife violation. The suspension remains in effect until the department receives satisfactory evidence of compliance from the issuing state. Section 40. Notice of the suspension shall be sent to the resident, who shall surrender all current South Dakota hunting, trapping, or fishing licenses to the department within ten days. Section 41.

The person may, within twenty days of the notice, request a hearing before the South Dakota Game, Fish and Parks Commission on whether the requirements for suspension have been met. Upon request, the commission shall set a hearing as early as practicable. The requesting person may present evidence and arguments at the hearing contesting whether: (1) A participating state suspended the person's privileges; (2) There was a conviction in the participating state; (3) The person failed to comply with the terms of a citation issued for a wildlife violation in a participating state; or (4) A conviction in a participating state could have led to the forfeiture of privileges under South Dakota law. Grounds other than those listed in this section may not be used to contest the department's decision to suspend the person's privileges. Section 42. At the hearing, the commission, through its authorized agent, may: (1) Administer oaths; (2) Issue subpoenas for the attendance of witnesses; and (3) Admit all relevant evidence and documents, including notifications from participating states.

If the person fails to request a hearing within twenty days of mailing of the notice of suspension, or if the suspension of hunting, trapping, or fishing privileges is affirmed by the commission or its authorized agent following a required hearing, the suspension of hunting, trapping, or fishing privileges shall become effective and the person shall surrender any current South Dakota hunting, trapping, or fishing license to the licensing authority within fourteen days. Section 13. All participating states may recognize the suspension of license privileges of any person by any participating state as though the violation resulting in the suspension had occurred in their state and could have been the basis for suspension of license privileges in their state. Section 14. Each participating state shall communicate suspension information to other participating states in form and content as contained in the compact manual. Section 15. If the licensing authority of the home state receives notice of the suspension of a person's hunting, trapping, or fishing privileges by a participating state, the licensing authority may suspend the person's hunting, trapping, or fishing privileges in the home state for the same duration as imposed by the participating state in accordance with \u00a7 41-6-75.1. The licensing authority of the home state shall notify the person of the suspension of hunting, trapping, fishing privileges in writing and direct the person to surrender any current South Dakota hunting, trapping, or fishing license to the licensing authority within fourteen days. Section 16. Except as expressly required by this compact, nothing in this compact may be construed to affect the right of any participating state to apply any of its laws relating to license privileges to any person or circumstance or to invalidate or prevent any agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a participating state and a nonparticipating state concerning wildlife law enforcement. Section 17. For the purposes of administering this Act and compact and to serve as a governing body for the resolution of all matters relating to the operation of this compact, a board of compact administrators is established. The board is composed of one representative from each of the participating states to be known as the compact administrator. The compact administrator shall be appointed by the head of the licensing authority of each participating state and serves and is subject to removal in accordance with the laws of the state that the compact administrator represents. A compact administrator may provide for the discharge of duties and the performance of functions as a board member by an alternate. An alternate is not entitled to serve unless written notification of the identity of the alternate has been given to the board. Section 18. Each member of the board of compact administrators is entitled to one vote. No action of the board is binding unless taken at a meeting at which a majority of the total number of the board's votes are cast in favor of the action. Action by the board may be only at a meeting at which a majority of the participating states is represented. Section 19. The board shall elect annually from its membership a presiding officer and a vice presiding officer. Section 20. The board shall adopt bylaws consistent with the provisions of this Act and compact or the laws of a participating state for the conduct of its business and may amend and rescind its bylaws. Section 21. The board may accept for any of its purposes and functions under this compact any and all donations and grants of money, equipment, supplies, materials, and services, conditional or otherwise, from any state, the United States, or any governmental agency, and receive, utilize, and dispose of the same. Section 22. The board may contract with, or accept services or personnel from, any governmental or intergovernmental agency, individual, firm, or corporation, or any private nonprofit organization or institution. Section 23. The board shall formulate all necessary procedures and develop uniform forms and documents for administering the provisions of this compact. All procedures and forms adopted pursuant to board action must be contained in a compact manual. Section 24. This compact becomes effective at such time as it is adopted in a substantially similar form by two or more states. Section 25. Entry into the compact shall be made by resolution of ratification approved by the South Dakota Department of Game, Fish and Parks Commission and submitted to the presiding officer of the board. Section 26. The resolution shall substantially be in the form and content as provided in the compact manual and shall include the following: (1) A citation of the authority from which the state is empowered to become a party to this compact; (2) An agreement of compliance with the terms and provisions of this compact; and (3) An agreement that compact entry is with all states participating in the compact and with all additional states legally becoming a party to the compact. Section 27. The effective date of entry shall be specified by the applying state but may not be less than sixty days after notice has been given by the presiding officer of the board of the compact administrators or by the secretariat of the board to each participating state that the resolution from the applying state has been received. Section 28. A participating state may withdraw from participation in this compact by official written notice to each participating state. Withdrawal does not become effective until ninety days after the notice of withdrawal is given. The notice shall be directed to the compact administrator of each member state. Withdrawal of any state does not affect the validity of this compact as to the remaining participating states. Section 29. The South Dakota Department of Game, Fish and Parks Commission is authorized on behalf of the state to enter or withdraw from the interstate wildlife violator compact pursuant to the terms of sections 24, 25, and 26 of this Act. Section 30. This compact may be amended. Amendments shall be presented in resolution form to the presiding officer of the board of the compact administrators and shall be initiated by one or more participating states. Section 31. Adoption of an amendment requires endorsement by all participating states and becomes effective thirty days after the date of the last endorsement. Section 32. Failure of a participating state to respond to the compact presiding officer within one hundred twenty days after receipt of a proposed amendment constitutes endorsement of the amendment. Section 33. The South Dakota Department of Game, Fish and Parks Commission is authorized to adopt amendments to the interstate wildlife violator compact pursuant to the terms of sections 30, 31, and 32 of this Act. Section 34. This compact shall be liberally construed so as to effectuate its intended purposes. The provisions of this compact are severable, and if any phrase, clause, sentence, or provision of this compact is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any participating state or the United States, or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, individual, or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of the compact is not affected thereby. If this compact is held contrary to the constitution of any participating state, the compact remains in full force and effect as to the remaining states and in full force and effect as to the participating state affected as to all severable matters. Section 35. A person whose hunting, trapping, or fishing privileges have been suspended and who hunts, traps, or fishes in this state or who applies for or purchases any licenses or permits to hunt, trap, or fish in this state, is guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor."}, {"bill_id": 18773, "bill_version_id": 101302, "bill_version": "Enrolled", "bill_version_date": "2004-02-13T08:12:13-06:00", "bill_text": ""}],
