No agency, community service provider, facility, school, or person who receives public funds and provides services to persons with developmental disabilities may engage in the following practices: (1) Corporal punishment--physical or verbal abuse, such as shaking, screaming, swearing, name calling, or any other activity that would be damaging to a person's physical well-being or self-respect; (2) Seclusion--placement of a person alone in a room or other area from which egress is prevented except if utilized by the South Dakota Developmental Center or a community support provider in accordance with \u00a7 \u00a7 27B-8-52, 27B-8-54, and 27B-8- 56 ; (3) Denial of food--preventing a person from having access to a nutritionally adequate diet as a means of modifying behavior.
