The homestead of every family, resident in this state, as hereinafter defined, so long as it continues to possess the character of a homestead is exempt from judicial sale, from judgment lien, and from all mesne or final process from any court, to the extent and as provided by statute, including a homestead listed for sale. However, a creditor or lien holder of a mobile home classified as a homestead under \u00a7 43-31-2 prior to January 1, 1973, may not be cut off and is not subject to a homestead exemption. In addition, a homestead with a value of less than one hundred seventy thousand dollars of a person seventy years of age or older, and the unremarried surviving spouse of such person, is exempt from sale for taxes for so long as it continues to possess the character of a homestead. Section 2. That \u00a7 43-31-2 be amended to read as follows: 43-31-2. The homestead must may embrace the house used as a home by the owner thereof, being either, real property or a mobile home as hereinafter defined, and if he or she has two or more houses or mobile homes thus used at different times and places, such owner may shall select which he or she will retain as a homestead. It must may not embrace more than one dwelling house or any other buildings except such as are properly appurtenant to the homestead as such; but a shop, store, or other building situated on real property and really used or occupied by the owner in the prosecution of his or her own ordinary business may be deemed appurtenant to such homestead.

Such mobile home must be registered in South Dakota at least six months prior to the claim of exemption.
