WHEREAS, on a per capita basis, South Dakota ranks fourth in the nation in numbers of military personnel serving in Iraq and Afghanistan, based on regular military, reserve, and National Guard service; and WHEREAS, South Dakotans have a long history of military service in time of war. These veterans, past and present, have brought honor to South Dakota through their service during times of national emergency and crisis; and WHEREAS, despite their service and sacrifice, many veterans face financial difficulty on their return to the United States, particularly during times of state and national economic crisis and uncertainty; and WHEREAS, in South Dakota there may be as many as one thousand veterans who are experiencing severe financial hardship with no coverage in the form of state veterans benefits to address their situation, no federal assistance other than food stamps, and no recourse other than to turn to family and friends for assistance; and WHEREAS, a proposal by District 10 of the South Dakota Veterans of Foreign Wars to establish a state grant program for veterans facing severe financial distress deserves consideration; and WHEREAS, the proposed grant program would entail a monthly payment of $300 to eligible veterans for an annual amount of $3,600. Strict eligibility standards would be established to preclude payment to persons with sufficient income sources. The program would be administered by the South Dakota Department of Veterans Affairs; and WHEREAS, South Dakota's military service members and veterans continue to serve their state and nation with distinction and honor: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the House of Representatives of the Eighty-sixth Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the Senate concurring therein, that the South Dakota Legislature endorses the concept advanced by District 10 of the South Dakota Veterans of Foreign Wars to provide a state-run grant program to assist eligible veterans facing severe financial hardship."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 2921, "action_date": "2011-02-23T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 17281, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/17281.pdf", "status_text": "First read and referred to", "journal_page": 491, "committee_id_action": 115, "committee_id_assigned": 108, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 2921, "action_date": "2011-03-02T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 17497, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/17497.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 108, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 2921, "action_date": "2011-03-02T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 17713, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/17713.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to the 41st legislative day", "journal_page": 595, "committee_id_action": 108, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 9729, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [12, 60, 51, 36, 61, 57, 37, 5, 35], "Nay": [53, 59], "Excused": [58, 91]}}]}
