WHEREAS, eighty-nine percent of people who suffer an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest die because they do not receive immediate CPR from someone on the scene; and WHEREAS, irreversible brain damage occurs after only three minutes of being deprived of oxygen, and irreversible heart damage occurs within twenty minutes of being deprived of oxygen; and WHEREAS, the average response time between a 911 call received and an Emergency Medical Service (EMS) arrival in South Dakota is ten minutes; and WHEREAS, eighty-eight percent of cardiac arrests actually occur at home, making it most likely that a person who needs to give CPR will be attempting to save the life of a loved one; and WHEREAS, hands-only CPR can double or even triple a victim's chance of survival; and WHEREAS, learning hands-only CPR can take as little as twenty minutes. In less time than it takes to watch a television sitcom, a teacher can give students the skills they need to save someone's life by giving CPR; and WHEREAS, including CPR as a skill taught to all South Dakota high school students would train an average of eleven thousand students per year; and WHEREAS, many of these students are located in very rural communities and homes which have much longer EMS wait times than the state average of ten minutes; and WHEREAS, South Dakota has only one hundred twenty-three ambulance services in the state with some rural services ready to close their doors due to lack of personnel to cover calls, little money to pay people to be on call, and a shrinking age-appropriate work force available to even show up for training or calls in their communities; and WHEREAS, ninety-nine South Dakota EMS services are listed as Basic Life Support only and twenty-five are listed as Advanced Life Support: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the Senate of the Eighty-Ninth Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the House of Representatives concurring therein, that the Legislature supports CPR becoming a basic skill that is taught in a required course in high school: and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Legislature encourages school districts to incorporate hands-only CPR training throughout South Dakota."}, {"bill_id": 6020, "bill_version_id": 31367, "bill_version": "Enrolled", "bill_version_date": "2014-03-04T08:47:13.477-06:00", "bill_text": ""}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 6020, "action_date": "2014-02-25T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 31062, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/31062.pdf", "status_text": "First Reading", "journal_page": 449, "committee_id_action": 229, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 6020, "action_date": "2014-02-26T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 31118, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/31118.pdf", "status_text": "Adopt Resolution", "journal_page": 480, "committee_id_action": 229, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 16670, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [469, 437, 444, 473, 846, 495, 447, 472, 470, 432, 465, 847, 483, 443, 429, 452, 436, 438, 526, 424, 491, 475, 435, 440, 493, 849, 474, 446, 494, 434, 490, 486], "Excused": [492, 428, 426]}}, {"bill_id": 6020, "action_date": "2014-02-27T13:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 31199, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/31199.pdf", "status_text": "First Reading", "journal_page": 590, "committee_id_action": 231, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 6020, "action_date": "2014-03-03T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 31335, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/31335.pdf", "status_text": "Concurred in Resolution", "journal_page": 605, "committee_id_action": 231, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 16826, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [528, 527, 453, 522, 525, 433, 467, 524, 456, 489, 517, 519, 505, 449, 431, 455, 425, 504, 481, 509, 503, 477, 501, 520, 479, 457, 454, 523, 496, 458, 451, 466, 845, 499, 442, 476, 521, 507, 478, 487, 423, 439, 500, 502, 497, 515, 511, 512, 463, 518, 484, 462, 485, 514, 459, 464, 510, 450, 506, 430, 513, 468, 498, 461, 516, 508, 480, 460, 448, 441]}}]}
