BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 31-4-1 be amended to read as follows: 31-4-1. The state trunk highway system as designated and adopted by the Legislature from time to time is hereby perpetuated. In designating the state trunk highway system, the primary factors to be considered include: (1) Highways which are functionally classified as arterials as approved by the Federal Highway Administration, except for highways providing service to a state or federal recreational access area; (2) The proximity of other state trunk highways and highways providing duplicating or similar service; (3) The cost of construction, maintenance, right-of-way, and the extent of needs on the state system; (4) The traffic volumes and other traffic survey data; and (5) The desirability of providing an integrated system to serve interstate travel, county seats, and cities of four hundred fifty population or greater. Section 2. The Transportation Commission may designate, by rules promulgated pursuant to chapter 1-26, a segment of the state trunk highway system as a minimum maintenance road if the commission determines that the segment is used only occasionally or intermittently for passenger or commercial travel. The commission shall identify the beginning and end points of the segment designated as minimum maintenance. A minimum maintenance segment may be maintained at a level less than the minimum standards for full maintenance roads, but shall be maintained at the level required to serve the occasional or intermittent traffic. Section 3. The Department of Transportation shall post signs on a minimum maintenance segment of road to notify the motoring public that it is a minimum maintenance segment and that the motoring public travels on the road at their own risk. The signs shall be posted at the entry points to and at regular intervals along a minimum maintenance segment. A properly posted sign shall be prima facie evidence that adequate notice of a minimum maintenance segment has been given to the motoring public."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 13456, "action_date": "1998-01-13T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 76884, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/76884.pdf", "status_text": "First read in Senate and referred to", "journal_page": 28, "committee_id_action": 601, "committee_id_assigned": 585, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 13456, "action_date": "1998-01-20T08:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 76521, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/76521.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 585, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 13456, "action_date": "1998-01-20T08:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 76521, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/76521.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass,", "journal_page": 111, "committee_id_action": 585, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 38628, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [2187, 2182, 2095, 2191, 2129, 2142, 2155]}}, {"bill_id": 13456, "action_date": "1998-01-21T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 76896, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/76896.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to another day", "journal_page": 156, "committee_id_action": 601, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 13456, "action_date": "1998-01-22T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 76898, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/76898.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to another day", "journal_page": 168, "committee_id_action": 601, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 13456, "action_date": "1998-01-23T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 76900, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/76900.pdf", "status_text": "Referred to", "journal_page": 182, "committee_id_action": 601, "committee_id_assigned": 585, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 13456, "action_date": "1998-01-29T08:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 76605, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/76605.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 585, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 13456, "action_date": "1998-01-29T08:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 76605, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/76605.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to 36th legislative day", "journal_page": 242, "committee_id_action": 585, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 40004, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [2187, 2182, 2095, 2191, 2129, 2142, 2155]}}]}
