for entities seeking state funding to provide voluntary prekindergarten programs to children from low-income families. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. Terms used in this Act mean: (1) \"Community early learning advisory group,\" a local level planning committee that develops the community prekindergarten plan; and (2) \"Prekindergarten,\" a program open to children at least three or four years old that is completed prior to the entry age of kindergarten pursuant to \u00a7 13-28-2 and provides children with educational experiences to prepare them for kindergarten. Section 2. Under the provisions of this Act, no child may be required to attend a prekindergarten program, and no public school district, private school, private prekindergarten program, private preschool program, private child care provider, or any other entity may be required to participate in voluntary prekindergarten programs. Section 3. Any funds appropriated by the Legislature for prekindergarten programs shall be used to provide voluntary prekindergarten programs pursuant to this Act to children from families whose countable income is at or below one hundred thirty percent of the federal poverty level, as updated annually by the Department of Social Services in administrative rules promulgated pursuant to chapter 1-26. In order to receive any state or federal funds pursuant to this Act to provide voluntary prekindergarten programs to eligible children, a prekindergarten program shall be licensed as a child welfare agency pursuant to \u00a7 26-6-14, be registered as a family day care provider pursuant to \u00a7 26-6-14.2, or be a school or part of a school that is accredited pursuant to \u00a7 13-1-12.1, and shall: (1) Maintain a staff to child ratio of at least one staff member for every ten children; (2) Divide participating children into groups of no more than twenty children; (3) Employ teachers who either have a bachelor's degree in early childhood education or who have a valid Child Development Associate (CDA) Credential awarded by the Council for Professional Recognition and a defined professional development plan, and are demonstrating ongoing progress toward earning a bachelor's degree; (4) Employ teachers' assistants who have a valid Child Development Associate (CDA) Credential awarded by the Council for Professional Recognition or who have earned a passing score on a designated state test for early childhood education providers approved by the Early Learning Council; (5) Follow early learning guidelines approved by the Early Learning Council and use research-based, developmentally-appropriate curriculum and assessment; and (6) Annually report on the developmental progress of each child in the program to the child's parent or guardian, and annually report to the community and to the Early Learning Council on the aggregate progress of all children in the program according to protocols established by the Early Learning Council. All programs that meet the requirements in this section, including sectarian programs, are eligible to provide voluntary prekindergarten programs pursuant to this Act. Any state funding provided shall be provided equally per child and is for the benefit of children from low-income families pursuant to section 3 of this Act. No state funding provided for voluntary prekindergarten programs may be expended for sectarian curriculum, supplies, or instruction. Section 4. Communities seeking funding for voluntary prekindergarten programs pursuant to this Act shall engage in a community planning process and submit a community prekindergarten plan to the South Dakota Early Learning Council established in section 7 of this Act. The plan shall identify or estimate the number of three and four-year old children in the community, and the number of children served in existing public and private prekindergarten programs. The plan shall also identify the community need, the providers who may serve eligible children using the funds provided, the number of children in the community to be served using those funds, and the allocation of those funds. Communities may join together to form a single community for planning purposes. Section 5. A community early learning advisory group shall develop the community prekindergarten plan.

Section 6. The community prekindergarten plan shall include the following: (1) A requirement that the same quality benchmarks be applied to all providers participating in the program; (2) A requirement for equal per-child funding; (3) A requirement that parents of an eligible child be allowed to choose a provider as long as the chosen provider has an opening for the child; (4) A requirement that providers continue to serve every child enrolled in the provider's program and do not remove or suspend any child from the program once it has begun; (5) An explanation of how funding for prekindergarten programs will preserve or expand the existing infrastructure in Head Start, private preschool, and private center-based or home-based day care; (6) An explanation of how funding will be used to maximize parental choice, enhance parent involvement, and strengthen families; and (7) An explanation of how the providers will support the transition of participating children to kindergarten.

The South Dakota Early Learning Council shall review all community prekindergarten plans prepared pursuant to section 4 of this Act and approve those that meet the requirements established in section 6 of this Act. If a plan fails to meet the established requirements and is not approved by the council, the council shall notify the community early learning advisory group of the plan deficiency and allow the group sixty days to cure the deficiency. If an approved plan includes a dissenting opinion, the council shall provide a written response to the dissent stating its reasons for approving the plan. Section 10. The Department of Social Services, with the advice of the Early Learning Council, shall promulgate rules pursuant to chapter 1-26 to establish the community prekindergarten plan submission process, to establish timelines for the submission, review, and approval of community prekindergarten plans in a timely manner, to provide for the monitoring of participating communities to ensure compliance with the approved community prekindergarten plans, and to establish certain protocols that voluntary prekindergarten programs must follow when reporting on the aggregate progress of participating children."}, {"bill_id": 1518, "bill_version_id": 12119, "bill_version": "Senate Education Engrossed", "bill_version_date": "2010-02-11T11:23:11.647-06:00", "bill_text": "FOR AN ACT ENTITLED, An Act to establish the South Dakota Early Learning Council, and to establish community planning processes and eligibility criteria for entities seeking state funding to provide voluntary prekindergarten programs to children from low-income families.
