BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. Terms used in this Act mean: (1) \"Child abuse,\" any violation of \u00a7 26-10-1 or chapter 22-22 if the victim of such crime is a child; (2) \"Perpetrator of child abuse,\" any person convicted of any violation of \u00a7 26-10-1 or chapter 22-22 if the victim of such crime was a child or whose name has been enrolled in the central registry for abuse and neglect established in \u00a7 26-8A-12. Section 2. Any payment of public moneys by or through the Department of Social Services for services directly related to the child abuse is a debt due to the department and owed by the perpetrator of the child abuse. Section 3. If a perpetrator of child abuse owes, but does not pay for services directly related to child abuse, the department has a lien upon all the property, both real and personal, including joint tenancy and homestead interests belonging to the perpetrator, or to be thereafter acquired by the perpetrator, or in which the perpetrator has any interest, for all public moneys expended by the department for services directly related to the child abuse. In order to preserve such lien, the department may give notice of the lien by filing with the register of deeds office a sworn statement or certificate showing the amount expended and unpaid for services directly related to the child abuse. The sworn statement or certificate may be filed in any county in which property of the perpetrator is located, and shall contain a description of the property, and shall attach to the property whether individually or jointly owned by the perpetrator. The priority of the lien shall be established by the date of the filing. The register of deeds office is not entitled to any fee for registering or filing any lien under this section. Section 4. The lien for services directly related to the child abuse is a lien by operation of law, with the full force and effect and attributes of a lien of this state, including enforceability, and is entitled, as a lien, to full faith and credit in this state."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 13893, "action_date": "1998-01-26T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 76901, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/76901.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 229, "committee_id_action": 600, "committee_id_assigned": 598, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 13893, "action_date": "1998-02-09T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 76683, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/76683.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 598, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 13893, "action_date": "1998-02-11T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 76710, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/76710.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 598, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 13893, "action_date": "1998-02-11T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 76710, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/76710.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to 36th legislative day", "journal_page": 553, "committee_id_action": 598, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 38600, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [2141, 2134, 2105, 2114, 2120, 2128, 2161, 2185, 2109, 2164, 2192], "Nay": [2178], "Excused": [2132]}}, {"bill_id": 13893, "action_date": "1998-02-11T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 76710, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/76710.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to 36th legislative day", "journal_page": 553, "committee_id_action": 598, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 38600, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [2141, 2134, 2105, 2114, 2120, 2128, 2161, 2185, 2109, 2164, 2192], "Nay": [2178], "Excused": [2132]}}]}
