The position of the prior carrier shall be the same whether the group policyholder or other entity secures replacement coverage from a new carrier, self-insures, or foregoes the provision of coverage; (2) If the individual was validly covered under the prior plan on the date of discontinuance, each individual who is eligible for coverage in accordance with the succeeding carrier's plan of benefits is, with respect to the class or classes of individuals, eligible and shall be covered under the succeeding carrier's plan if (a) any actively-at-work and nonconfinement rules are met, and (b) if required by the succeeding carrier, the individual requests enrollment; (3) Each person individual not covered under the succeeding carrier's plan of benefits in accordance with subdivision (2) shall nevertheless be covered by the succeeding carrier in accordance with the following rules if the individual was validly covered, including benefit extension, under the prior plan on the date of discontinuance and if the individual is a member of the class or classes of individuals eligible for coverage under the succeeding carrier's plan.

For the purposes of this subdivision, benefits of the prior plan shall be determined in accordance with all of the definitions, conditions, and covered expense provisions of the prior plan rather than those of the succeeding plan. The benefit determination shall be made as if coverage had not been replaced by the succeeding carrier; and (7) A succeeding carrier's policy may contain a provision limiting benefits to employees who are actively at work. However, any individual who remains as an employee, was covered by the prior carrier, and was disabled as of the date the succeeding carrier coverage became effective for that employer, will continue to be covered by the prior carrier as long as the individual remains an employee. An individual who is not disabled and is not at work on the date the succeeding carrier's coverage commences is considered actively at work as long as the absence from work is an employer-approved absence.

The position of the prior carrier shall be the same whether the group policyholder or other entity secures replacement coverage from a new carrier, self-insures, or foregoes the provision of coverage; (2) If the individual was validly covered under the prior plan on the date of discontinuance, each individual who is eligible for coverage in accordance with the succeeding carrier's plan of benefits is, with respect to the class or classes of individuals, eligible and shall be covered under the succeeding carrier's plan if (a) any actively-at-work and nonconfinement rules are met, and (b) if required by the succeeding carrier, the individual requests enrollment; (3) Each individual not covered under the succeeding carrier's plan of benefits in accordance with subdivision (2) shall nevertheless be covered by the succeeding carrier in accordance with the following rules if the individual was validly covered, including benefit extension, under the prior plan on the date of discontinuance and if the individual is a member of the class or classes of individuals eligible for coverage under the succeeding carrier's plan.

For the purposes of this subdivision, benefits of the prior plan shall be determined in accordance with all of the definitions, conditions, and covered expense provisions of the prior plan rather than those of the succeeding plan. The benefit determination shall be made as if coverage had not been replaced by the succeeding carrier; and (7) A succeeding carrier's policy may contain a provision limiting benefits to employees who are actively at work. However, any individual who remains as an employee, was covered by the prior carrier, and was disabled as of the date the succeeding carrier coverage became effective for that employer, will continue to be covered by the prior carrier as long as the individual remains an employee. An individual who is not disabled and is not at work on the date the succeeding carrier's coverage commences is considered actively at work as long as the absence from work is an employer-approved absence.
