BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That chapter 9-35 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Terms used in this Act mean: (1) \"Cable operator,\" any person who provides cable service over a cable system; (2) \"Cable service,\" the one-way transmission to subscribers of video programming or other programming service and the subscriber interaction, if any, which is required for the selection or use of such video programming or other programming service; (3) \"Cable system,\" a facility consisting of a set of closed transmission paths and associated signal generation, reception, and control equipment that is designed to provide cable service to multiple subscribers within a community. The term does not include a facility that serves subscribers without using the public right-of-way; a facility of a telecommunications company that provides telecommunications service as defined and regulated by chapter 49-31, except to the extent that the facility is used to transmit video programming directly to subscribers, unless the extent of such use is solely to provide interactive on-demand services; or an open video system as defined and operated consistent with federal law; (4) \"Competitive operator,\" any alternative provider of a cable service, regardless of the technology used and whether required to have a franchise or not; (5) \"Multiple dwelling unit,\" a site, lot, field, or tract of land or water, whether occupied or under construction, whether used as a residence or business, containing more than four dwelling units; (6) \"Other programming service,\" information that a cable operator makes available to all subscribers generally; (7) \"Property owner,\" any person with a recorded interest in a multiple dwelling unit, or person known to the cable operator to be the owner or authorized agent of the person; (8) \"Resident,\" any person paying rent to a property owner; and (9) \"Video programming,\" programming provided by, or generally considered comparable to programming provided by, a television broadcast station. Section 2. That chapter 9-35 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: A property owner or other person controlling access shall provide a cable operator or competitive operator access to the property owner's multiple dwelling unit. The access shall be perpetual and freely transferable from one cable operator or competitive operator to another. The access shall be to a point or points within the multiple dwelling unit, specified by the property owner, as the demarcation point between the operator's facilities and the facilities that connect to each individual dwelling unit. Ownership of facilities beyond the demarcation point to individual dwelling units in the multiple dwelling unit and the operation of any demarcation point are as governed by federal law and regulation. Section 3. That chapter 9-35 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: A property owner may require from a cable operator or competitive operator, for the property owner's review and approval, written plans and other documentation showing the placement and securing of the operator's facilities in the multiple dwelling unit. Approval of such plans may not be unreasonably withheld. Section 4. That chapter 9-35 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: The facilities shall be installed in an expeditious and workmanlike manner, shall comply with applicable codes, and shall be installed parallel to existing utility lines when economically feasible. The property owner may require the cable operator or competitive cable operator to post a bond or equivalent security in an amount not to exceed the estimated cost of installation in the multiple dwelling unit. Any bond filed with a franchising authority that would also provide coverage to the property owner fulfills the requirements of this section. Section 5. That chapter 9-35 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: A cable operator or competitive operator shall indemnify the property owner for damage caused by the operator in the installation, operation, maintenance, or removal of its facilities on or within the multiple dwelling unit. The property owner may require an operator, after at least sixty days written notice, to promptly relocate its facilities on or within the multiple dwelling unit for the purpose of rehabilitation, redecoration, or necessary maintenance of the multiple dwelling unit. Section 6. That chapter 9-35 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: The cable operator or competitive operator shall: (1) Compensate the property owner for any demonstrable diminution in the fair market value of the multiple dwelling unit resulting directly from the installation of the operator's facilities; (2) Reimburse the property owner in an amount not to exceed one thousand dollars for costs incurred by the property owner for the professional review of any plans or other documentation regarding the installation, modification, or relocation of any of the operator's facilities; and (3) Compensate the property owner, on a one-time basis and in a reasonable amount, for the access to the multiple dwelling unit. Any disputes regarding the determination of the appropriate compensation authorized by this subdivision may be resolved by an action in state court. Section 7. That chapter 9-35 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: No person may interfere with the installation, operation, maintenance, relocation, or removal of a cable operator's or competitive operator's facilities. Section 8. That chapter 9-35 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Nothing in this Act requires any resident to subscribe to any services offered by a cable operator or a competitive operator. Section 9. That chapter 9-35 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: The provisions of this Act are not applicable to any contractual arrangement existing prior to the effective date of this Act."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 19806, "action_date": "2005-01-27T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 103466, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/103466.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 200, "committee_id_action": 860, "committee_id_assigned": 848, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 19806, "action_date": "2005-02-08T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 104285, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/104285.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 848, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 19806, "action_date": "2005-02-08T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 104285, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/104285.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass,", "journal_page": 381, "committee_id_action": 848, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 61781, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [3155, 3169, 3170, 3195, 3207, 3226, 3235, 3240], "Nay": [3156, 3208, 3255, 3234], "Excused": [3237]}}, {"bill_id": 19806, "action_date": "2005-02-09T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 104459, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/104459.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass,", "journal_page": 413, "committee_id_action": 860, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "F", "vote": {"vote_id": 61974, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [3155, 3160, 3164, 3169, 3170, 3176, 3177, 3182, 3183, 3190, 3195, 3197, 3203, 3207, 3209, 3218, 3222, 3223, 3226, 3233, 3235, 3238, 3240, 3243, 3246, 3248], "Nay": [3156, 3158, 3159, 3161, 3162, 3167, 3171, 3172, 3174, 3175, 3178, 3181, 3184, 3187, 3188, 3189, 3191, 3192, 3194, 3196, 3199, 3206, 3208, 3211, 3213, 3216, 3220, 3225, 3227, 3229, 3230, 3231, 3232, 3234, 3237, 3244, 3245, 3249, 3251, 3252, 3253, 3254, 3255, 3215]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/19806"}
