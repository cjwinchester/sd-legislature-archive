The parents shall share decision-making authority and responsibility as to the important decisions affecting the child's welfare and if parents are unable to agree, the court may order the parties to submit to a preselected mediator.

BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 25-5-7.1 be amended to read as follows: 25-5-7.1. In any custody dispute between parents, the court may order joint legal custody so that both parents retain full parental rights and responsibilities with respect to their child and so that both parents must confer on, and participate in, major decisions affecting the welfare of the child. In ordering joint legal custody, the court may consider the expressed desires of the parents and may grant to one party the ultimate responsibility over specific aspects of the child's welfare or may divide those aspects between the parties based on the best interest of the child. If it appears to the court to be in the best interest of the child, the court may order, or the parties may agree, how any such responsibility shall be divided. Such areas of responsibility may include the child's primary physical residence, child care, education, extracurricular activities, medical and dental care, religious instruction, the child's use of motor vehicles, and any other responsibilities which the court finds unique to a particular family or in the best interest of the child. If the court awards joint legal custody, it may also order joint physical custody in such proportions as are in the best interests of the child, notwithstanding the objection of either parent.

That chapter 25-5 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: If joint legal custody is awarded, pursuant to \u00a7 25-5-7.1, there is a rebuttable presumption that both parents have joint physical custody of their child. Joint physical custody of their child is defined as equal time sharing. The burden of overcoming the presumption rests on the parent challenging the presumption. The presumption may be overcome by demonstrating that joint physical custody would not be in the best interest of the child, that the distance between the two parents' residences makes joint physical custody reasonably impractical, or by one parent waiving the presumption. The party challenging the presumption must overcome the presumption by the greater convincing force of the evidence.
