That chapter 13-53 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: The Board of Regents shall prepare specifications and select successful bidders for a period not to exceed three years to act as active depositories for the collection of drafts, checks, certificates of deposit, credit card transactions, electric fund transfers, or coupons that may be received by the board or by the institutions under the control of the board on account of claims due them, in which may be maintained active checking accounts. The board may negotiate with the successful bidder to continue such depositories for two years beyond the initial three. The board, on receipt of any draft, check, credit card transaction, electric fund transfer, or certificate of deposit on account of state dues, may place the same in such active depository for collection, and the active depository may collect the same without delay. The board shall fix the interest to be paid by such active depository at levels consistent with those paid by active depositories used by other agencies of state government. The board shall transfer receipts from the accounts established pursuant to this section to the state treasury at the times and in the manner required of other state agencies.
