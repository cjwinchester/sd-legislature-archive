BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 26-7A-31 be amended to read as follows: 26-7A-31. If the child or the child's parents, guardian, or other custodian requests an attorney in proceedings under this chapter or chapter 26-8A, 26-8B, or 26-8C and if the court finds the party to be without sufficient financial means to employ an attorney, the court shall appoint an attorney for the party. The court may appoint an attorney for any child or any party to the proceedings without request of the party if the court deems representation by an attorney necessary to protect the interests of the party. Reasonable and just compensation for services of a court-appointed attorney and for necessary expenses and costs incident to the proceedings shall be determined by the court within guidelines established by the presiding judge of the circuit court and shall be paid by the county in which the action is being conducted according to the manner prescribed by the court. If the county in which the action is being conducted provides indigent counsel through a contract with any attorney licensed in this state pursuant to subdivision 23A-40-7(3), the compensation shall be that which the attorney would receive under the contract. This section does not preclude the court from appointment of an attorney for a child as required by provisions of chapter 26-8A. Section 2. That \u00a7 26-8A-9 be amended to read as follows: 26-8A-9. Upon receipt of a report pursuant to \u00a7 26-8A-8, the Department of Social Services or law enforcement officers shall investigate. Investigating personnel may personally interview a child out of the presence of the child's parents, guardian, or custodian without advance notice or consent. The investigation does not prohibit any other lawful action. If the investigation and report indicate that child abuse or neglect has occurred, the state's attorney shall take appropriate action immediately. The court may appoint an attorney, guardian ad litem, or special advocate to assist in representing the best interests of the child. Any such appointment shall occur in the manner the county in which the action is being conducted has chosen to provide indigent counsel under \u00a7 23A-40-7.
