The publication shall be made once every three weeks. Section 4. That chapter 15-3 be amended by adding a NEW SECTION to read: Failure to remove the substantial inclosure within the time period provided in chapter 15-3 does not cause right of title to be extinguished, if the record owner meets the requirements of section 1 and 2 of this Act.

That chapter 15-3 be amended by adding a NEW SECTION to read: No later than thirty days after the issuance of notice, the record owner may elect to have the claim asserted in an action to quiet the title to the real property pursuant to chapter 21-41. In an action in any court of this state in which the title or right of possession to any possessed property is in dispute, the court may, upon application of any of the parties to the suit, enter an order for a survey of the part of the property in dispute as may be necessary, which shall determine the boundary.
