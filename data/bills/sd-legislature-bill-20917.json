The Legislature finds that not all motor fuel taxes which qualify for the nonhighway agricultural motor fuel tax refund are, in fact, refunded under the procedure set forth in this chapter. The Legislature further finds that a certain amount of these unclaimed tax refunds from the sale of motor fuel for nonhighway agricultural uses should be utilized used for agricultural purposes in a manner which benefits both agriculture and the citizens of the state by preserving its natural resources. Therefore, the Legislature declares that an amount equal to thirty-five percent of one-half of the agricultural gasoline sales as determined by the latest published information from the USDA - National Agricultural Statistics Service is used for nonhighway agricultural purposes and eligible for refund of the motor fuel tax. The amount of eligible tax refunds less the claimed refunds authorized by \u00a7 10-47B-119, not to exceed one million five hundred thousand dollars in any single fiscal year, represents the amount of unclaimed tax refunds from the sale of motor fuel tax for nonhighway agricultural uses.

On or about August first of each year, the preceding year's remaining motor fuel tax administration account balance, less an amount to provide cash flow within the account, shall be transferred to the state highway fund. The remaining balance is to be calculated by subtracting from the total of monthly deposits, the amount of corresponding expenses. The expense of administering the chapters relating to motor and special fuel taxation shall be paid out of appropriations made by the Legislature; (4) Transfer Each September transfer an amount to the coordinated soil and water conservation fund an amount equal to thirty-five percent the remainder of the product of multiplying one-half of agricultural gasoline sales as determined by the latest published information of the USDA - National Agricultural Statistics Service, times the rate of tax provided for motor fuel under this chapter less the amount of the claimed refunds authorized by \u00a7 10-47B-119 for the preceding month, not to exceed a cumulative total of one million five hundred thousand dollars in any single fiscal year; (5) Each July transfer to the parks and recreation fund an amount equal to the product of multiplying the number of licensed motorized boats as of the previous December thirty-first, times one hundred forty gallons, times the rate of tax provided for motor fuels under this chapter; (6) Transfer to the member jurisdictions taxes collected under the provisions of the international fuel tax agreement; and (7) Transfer the remaining cash balance to the state highway fund.

The Conservation Commission shall, by rules promulgated pursuant to chapter 1-26, establish a contingency reserve within the coordinated soil and water conservation fund to address natural resource emergencies.

Under this program, the State Conservation Commission may grant or loan funds from the coordinated soil and water conservation fund. The Conservation Commission shall promulgate rules pursuant to chapter 1-26 for administration, terms, and conditions for the disbursement of grants or loans to conservation districts and to establish criteria for the selection of projects to receive grants or loans through the Coordinated Soil and Water Conservation Program.

For purposes of section 1 of this Act, the amount of unclaimed tax refunds from the sale of motor fuel for nonhighway agricultural purposes in any fiscal year is determined as provided in this section. The number of gallons of gasoline and gasoline blend sales in South Dakota in accordance with section 1 of this Act, is twelve percent of the gasoline and gasoline blend usage by the plains states as reported in the USDA-NASS Farm Production Expenditures Annual Summary Report. The number of gallons of gasoline and gasoline blend used in South Dakota for agricultural purposes is the amount of money spent on gasoline and gasoline blend in South Dakota for agricultural purposes divided by the average price of gasoline as published by the Energy Information Administration. The number of gallons of gasoline and gasoline blend purchased for nonhighway agricultural purposes is fifty percent of the gallons purchased in South Dakota in accordance with section 1 of this Act. That amount multiplied by the tax rate pursuant to \u00a7 10-47B-4 is the amount of tax that is eligible to be refunded by the Department of Revenue and Regulation. The amount of money eligible for refunds less the actual amount of refunds paid by the Department of Revenue and Regulation is the total amount of unclaimed refunds. Section 3.

On or about August first of each year, the preceding year's remaining motor fuel tax administration account balance, less an amount to provide cash flow within the account, shall be transferred to the state highway fund. The remaining balance is to be calculated by subtracting from the total of monthly deposits, the amount of corresponding expenses. The expense of administering the chapters relating to motor and special fuel taxation shall be paid out of appropriations made by the Legislature; (4) Transfer Each September transfer an amount to the coordinated soil and water conservation fund an amount equal to thirty-five percent of the claimed refunds authorized by \u00a7 10-47B-119 for the preceding month, not to exceed a cumulative total of one million five hundred thousand dollars in any single fiscal year the amount calculated pursuant to section 2 of this Act ; (5) Each July transfer to the parks and recreation fund an amount equal to the product of multiplying the number of licensed motorized boats as of the previous December thirty-first, times one hundred forty gallons, times the rate of tax provided for motor fuels under this chapter; (6) Transfer to the member jurisdictions taxes collected under the provisions of the international fuel tax agreement; and (7) Transfer the remaining cash balance to the state highway fund. Section 4. That \u00a7 38-7-26 be amended to read as follows: 38-7-26.

Under this program, the State Conservation Commission may grant or loan funds from the coordinated soil and water conservation fund.
