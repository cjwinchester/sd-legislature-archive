WHEREAS, in August, 2014, certain landowners filed a lawsuit against the Department of Game, Fish and Parks and the State seeking an injunction and declaratory relief that the public did not have the right to use the water and ice overlying their private property; and WHEREAS, the nonmeandered lakes at issue in the case were Duerre Lake and Jesse Slough in Day County; and WHEREAS, through the appeals process the case made it to the Supreme Court of South Dakota and the court issued the opinion of Duerre v. Hepler, 892 N.W.2d 209 (2017); and WHEREAS, the court held that, \"until the Legislature acts, neither the public nor the Landowners have a superior right to use the waters and ice overlying the Landowners' private property. Similarly, until the Legislature acts, the GF&P and other State defendants cannot facilitate access for members of the public to enter or use the waters and ice overlying the Landowners' private property for recreational purposes,\"; and WHEREAS, the court decision should have only applied to the two nonmeandered lakes in the court case; however, in response to the Duerre decision the executive branch unnecessarily decided to restrict access to twenty-five popular nonmeandered lakes across the state; and WHEREAS, several local business owners are being greatly and negatively affected because the executive branch, through the Department of Game, Fish and Parks, is no longer facilitating public recreational access to nonmeandered lakes in the state; and WHEREAS, many businesses are suffering a substantial loss of income from sportsmen, some as high as an eighty-five percent income loss from this point last year; and WHEREAS, unless the twenty-five nonmeandered lakes are opened in the immediate future, many local small businesses will be irreparably harmed by the lack of tourism and recreational dollars coming into the community: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the House of Representatives of the Ninety-Second Special Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the Senate concurring therein, that the Legislature urges the Governor to exercise his authority and re-open the nonmeandered lakes of: Casey's Slough, Cottonwood GPA, Dry #1, Dry #2, and Swan in Clark County; Deep and Goose in Codington County; East Krause, Lynn, Middle Lynn, and Reetz in Day County; North Scatterwood in Edmunds County; Three Buck in Hamlin County; Bullhead and Cattail-Kettle in Marshall County; Keisz in McPherson County; Grass, Loss, Scott, and Twin in Minnehaha County; Twin in Sanborn County; Cottonwood and Mud in Spink County; Cottonwood in Sully County; and Dog Ear in Tripp County; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, if the nonmeandered lakes are opened to recreational access local business will be able to get back to business as usual and the Legislature will have the time it needs to craft a more workable solution that is fair to all."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 8387, "action_date": "2017-06-12T10:00:00-05:00", "document_id": 46104, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/46104.pdf", "status_text": "First Reading", "journal_page": 12, "committee_id_action": 365, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 8387, "action_date": "2017-06-12T10:00:00-05:00", "document_id": 46104, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/46104.pdf", "status_text": "Withdrawn at the Request of the Prime Sponsor", "journal_page": 13, "committee_id_action": 365, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}]}
