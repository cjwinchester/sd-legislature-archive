Notwithstanding \u00a7 26-8A-2, a parent may refuse consent for the provision of any health care service to a minor child if the parent reasonably believes that the service would induce, confirm, or promote the child's belief that the child's gender is different from that which it was at birth or that the gender with which the child identifies is different from that which it was at birth. Any parent who refuses consent in accordance with this section may not be subject to liability, to any penalty, or to any legal action for the refusal.
