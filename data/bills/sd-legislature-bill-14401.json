and WHEREAS, from its birth to this day, the United States has prized this legacy of religious freedom and honored this heritage by standing for religious freedom and offering refuge to those suffering religious persecution; and WHEREAS, freedom of religious belief and practice is a universal human right and fundamental freedom articulated in numerous international instruments, including the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Helsinki Accords, the Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief, the United Nations Charter, and the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms; and WHEREAS, the right to freedom of religion is under renewed and, in some cases, increasing assault in many counties around the world; and WHEREAS, it is even more abhorrent that religious believers in many countries face such severe and violent forms of religious persecution as detention, torture, beatings, forced marriage, rape, imprisonment, enslavement, mass resettlement, and death merely for the peaceful belief in, change of, or practice of their faith; and WHEREAS, in many counties, religious believers are forced to meet secretly, and religious leaders are targeted by national security forces and hostile mobs; and WHEREAS, though not confined to a particular region or regime, religious persecution is often particularly widespread, systematic, and heinous under totalitarian governments and in countries with militant, politicized religious majorities; and WHEREAS, persecution of religious believers around the world has emerged as one of the most compelling human rights issues of the day, in particular, the worldwide persecution and martyrdom of Christians persists at alarming levels, which is an affront to the international moral community and to all people of conscience; and WHEREAS, Chinese Christians and Tibetan Buddhists are now experiencing the worst persecution at the hands of the Chinese government since the 1970s; and WHEREAS, severe persecution of people for their religious beliefs is also occurring in North Korea, Cuba, Vietnam, Indonesia, including East Timor, and in certain countries in the Middle East and the former Soviet Union, to name only a few;
