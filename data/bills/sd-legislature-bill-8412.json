However, an employer may prohibit a human resources employee, a supervisor, or any other employee whose job responsibilities require or allow access to other employees' compensation information, from disclosing the information without prior written consent from the employee whose information is sought or requested, unless the compensation information is a public record pursuant to chapter 1-27. Section 4. That chapter 60-2 be amended by adding a NEW SECTION to read: Any employee or prospective employee claiming to be aggrieved by any unlawful employment practice under sections 1 or 2 of this Act may bring a civil suit for damages in circuit court. The court may award reasonable attorney fees and costs in addition to any judgment awarded to the employee or prospective employee. Section 5. That chapter 60-2 be amended by adding a NEW SECTION to read: The unlawful prohibitions on employers under this Act do not apply if: (1) A prospective employee has voluntarily disclosed the information at issue under section 1 of this Act; or (2) A prospective employer seeks to permit a prospective employee to confirm prior wages or salary."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 8412, "action_date": "2018-01-23T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 47664, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/47664.pdf", "status_text": "First read in Senate and referred to", "journal_page": 200, "committee_id_action": 395, "committee_id_assigned": 369, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 8412, "action_date": "2018-01-30T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 47994, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/47994.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 369, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 8412, "action_date": "2018-02-01T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 48172, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/48172.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 369, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 8412, "action_date": "2018-02-01T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 48462, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/48462.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to the 41st legislative day", "journal_page": 314, "committee_id_action": 369, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 25159, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [1290], "Yea": [1304, 1239, 1218, 1288, 1243, 1234]}}]}
