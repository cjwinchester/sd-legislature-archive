Section 4. The county interdisciplinary child information team and the written agreement shall facilitate the exchange and sharing of information that one or more team members may be able to use in serving a child in the course of their professions, specialities, interests, or occupations for the purpose of holding each child accountable, ensuring the safety of the child and the community, and providing early intervention to avert more serious problems.
