Section 25. A license revoked on disciplinary grounds is subject to expiration as provided in this Act, but it may not be renewed. If such license is reinstated after its expiration, the licensee, as a condition of reinstatement, shall meet the license requirements for new licensees and shall pay a reinstatement fee that is equal to the renewal fee in effect on the last regular renewal date immediately preceding the date of reinstatement. Section 26.

The board may adopt rules, pursuant to chapter 1-26, permitting inactive licensure. The rules shall specify the requirements and procedures for placing a license on inactive status, the length a license may remain on inactive status, and the requirements and procedures to activate an inactive license. Except as otherwise specified by rule, an inactive licensee may not engage in the practice of speech-language pathology. Section 28. The board may grant a license to any person who has successfully complied with the requirements of the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, holds a Certificate of Clinical Competence in speech-language pathology, and holds a current license in another state in speech-language pathology if the following conditions are met: (1) The other state maintains a standard of qualifications and examinations for speech-language pathologists that meets or exceeds the requirements for licensure in this state; (2) Payment of the fee established by the board for licensure; and (3) Submission of evidence satisfactory to the board of current out-of-state license.

Section 30. Any person not eligible for licensure as a speech-language pathologist or not eligible for authorization to practice as an intern, who assists in the practice of speech-language pathology while in the employ of and under the supervision of a licensed speech-language pathologist shall apply for and receive licensure from the board as a speech-language pathology assistant. Before granting such licensure the board shall consider the academic training and clinical experience of the applicant, the specific duties and responsibilities assigned, the amount and nature of the supervision that is available to the assistant, and the number of assistants assigned to the proposed supervisor. Each applicant shall satisfy one of the following requirements: (1) Any applicant applying for licensure with an associate's degree shall produce written notification from the chair or program director of an academic institution verifying that the applicant attended the academic institution and completed the academic course work requirement and clinical work requirement. This written notification shall serve as presumptive proof of completion of the requirements; (2) Any applicant applying for licensure with a bachelor's degree shall produce written notification from the chair or program director of an academic institution verifying that the applicant attended the academic institution and completed the academic course work requirement. Nothing in this section may be construed to prevent a speech-language pathologist from employing any person in a nonclinical capacity. Section 31. Any person who is employed as a speech-language pathology assistant as of July 1, 2011, and does not otherwise meet the qualifications set forth in this Act, may practice as a speech-language pathology assistant without a license as long as the assistant is continuously employed while performing the duties of that employment. This exception expires January 1, 2020, at which time no person may practice without a license issued pursuant to this Act. Section 32. If for any reason the supervising speech-language pathologist is no longer available to provide the level of supervision stipulated, the supervisor and licensee shall notify the board. The speech-language pathology assistant may not perform any additional tasks until a licensed speech-language pathologist with at least two years of experience has been designated as the speech-language pathology assistant's supervisor and the board has approved the change. Section 33. A speech-language pathologist shall provide no less than thirty percent direct and indirect supervision weekly for the first ninety days and no less than twenty percent direct, onsite supervision weekly. After successful completion of the first ninety days, the supervising speech-language pathologist shall provide no less than twenty percent supervision weekly and no less than ten percent direct, onsite supervision weekly. The supervising speech-language pathologist shall be available by electronic means at all times when the speech-language pathology assistant is performing clinical activities. The assistant shall document the supervision. For the purposes of this Act, direct supervision is in-view observation and guidance by a speech-language pathologist while an assigned activity is performed by an assistant. Indirect supervision is any activity other than direct observation and guidance, conducted by a speech-language pathologist that may include methods such as audio recordings, videotape recordings, telephone communications, conferences, and review of data. Section 34. An applicant for licensure as a speech-language pathology assistant shall submit an application, upon a form prescribed by the board, that is signed by both the applicant and the supervising speech-language pathologist. The supervising speech-language pathologist shall submit a notarized statement explicitly indicating that the supervisor agrees to supervise the assistant's practice and that the supervisor accepts full and complete responsibility for that practice. If the applicant is not currently employed, the application shall be signed by the chair of the academic program of the institution conferring the degree. Within thirty days of the applicant's employment, the supervising speech-language pathologist shall submit a notarized statement explicitly indicating that the supervisor agrees to supervise the assistant's practice and that the supervisor accepts full and complete responsibility for that practice.
