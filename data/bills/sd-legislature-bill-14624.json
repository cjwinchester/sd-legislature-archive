WHEREAS, hunting, along with the respect for wildlife and the natural environment that hunting fosters, is a wholesome, family tradition in South Dakota that should be continued and passed on to our children, particularly as our society becomes more urbanized and fewer young people have the opportunity to experience those traditions; and WHEREAS, South Dakota's excellent pheasant hunting results in high numbers of resident and nonresident pheasant hunters and sometimes intense hunting pressure during the regular season, particularly during the opening weeks of the season; and WHEREAS, this hunting pressure sometimes makes it difficult for younger hunters to experience a satisfying hunting experience; and WHEREAS, South Dakota has successfully conducted youth deer hunting seasons before the opening of the regular season, which would suggest that a special youth pheasant hunting season would be feasible: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the House of Representatives of the Seventy- fourth Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the Senate concurring therein, that the South Dakota Legislature supports the establishment by the Game, Fish and Parks Commission of an annual three-day youth pheasant hunting season that would begin on the Saturday before the opening of the regular season and would be open to any resident or nonresident hunter under the age of sixteen who holds a valid hunting license or permit, has completed a hunter safety course, and is accompanied by an adult who may not carry a firearm. During the youth season, the daily limit would be two cock pheasants, shooting hours would be from noon until sunset, and section- line hunting would not be permitted."}, {"bill_id": 14624, "bill_version_id": 81265, "bill_version": "Enrolled", "bill_version_date": "1999-02-16T00:00:00-06:00", "bill_text": "February 4, 1999 February 11, 1999"}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 14624, "action_date": "1999-02-02T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 81866, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/81866.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 614, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 14624, "action_date": "1999-02-04T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 81867, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/81867.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 614, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 14624, "action_date": "1999-02-04T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 81867, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/81867.pdf", "status_text": "Adopt Resolution", "journal_page": 365, "committee_id_action": 614, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 43085, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [2204, 2211, 2213, 2222, 2236, 2248, 2249, 2260, 2284, 2286, 2297, 2298], "Excused": [2261]}}, {"bill_id": 14624, "action_date": "1999-02-05T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 82126, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/82126.pdf", "status_text": "Adopt Resolution", "journal_page": 394, "committee_id_action": 628, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 43329, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [2200, 2203, 2204, 2207, 2208, 2209, 2210, 2211, 2212, 2213, 2214, 2218, 2220, 2222, 2223, 2227, 2228, 2229, 2231, 2232, 2233, 2236, 2237, 2238, 2240, 2243, 2244, 2247, 2248, 2249, 2250, 2253, 2254, 2255, 2256, 2257, 2260, 2262, 2265, 2266, 2267, 2268, 2271, 2272, 2273, 2276, 2277, 2278, 2279, 2281, 2282, 2284, 2286, 2287, 2288, 2290, 2291, 2295, 2296, 2297, 2298, 2300, 2301, 2302, 2303, 2245], "Excused": [2216, 2219, 2261, 2264]}}, {"bill_id": 14624, "action_date": "1999-02-11T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 82001, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/82001.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 602, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 14624, "action_date": "1999-02-11T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 82001, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/82001.pdf", "status_text": "Concur In resolution", "journal_page": 444, "committee_id_action": 602, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 41319, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [2205, 2206, 2241, 2242, 2252, 2280, 2292, 2294, 2224]}}, {"bill_id": 14624, "action_date": "1999-02-12T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 81775, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/81775.pdf", "status_text": "Concur In resolution", "journal_page": 478, "committee_id_action": 629, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 41434, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [2199, 2201, 2202, 2205, 2206, 2215, 2217, 2221, 2225, 2226, 2230, 2234, 2239, 2241, 2242, 2246, 2251, 2252, 2258, 2259, 2263, 2269, 2270, 2274, 2275, 2280, 2283, 2285, 2289, 2292, 2294, 2299], "Excused": [2224, 2293], "Nay": [2235]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/14624"}
