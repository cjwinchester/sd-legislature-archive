BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 13-3-55 be amended to read as follows: 13-3-55. Every public school district shall annually administer the same assessment to all students in grades three to eight, inclusive, and in grade eleven. The assessment shall measure the academic progress of each student. Every public school district shall annually administer to all students in at least two grade levels an achievement test to assess writing skills. The assessment instruments shall be provided by the Department of Education, and the department shall determine the two grade levels to be tested. The tests shall be administered within timelines established by the Department of Education by rules promulgated pursuant to chapter 1-26 starting in the spring of the 2002-2003 school year. Each state-designed test shall be correlated with the state's content standards. The South Dakota Board of Education may promulgate rules pursuant to chapter 1-26 to provide for administration of all assessments. However, no student is required to take any assessment administered pursuant to this section if the student's parent or guardian, or, if the student is emancipated, the student submits a request for an exemption from the assessments on forms provided by the Department of Education to the superintendent of the school district within one hundred eighty days of the start of any school fiscal year. The request for an exemption shall be dated and signed by the parent or guardian, or the emancipated student, and the request shall be notarized. No school district or school district employee may take any punitive action against a student, including preventing the student from participating in any extracurricular activity, due to the student's exemption from the testing requirements established in this section."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 6441, "action_date": "2015-01-26T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 33711, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/33711.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 157, "committee_id_action": 286, "committee_id_assigned": 273, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 6441, "action_date": "2015-02-11T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 34719, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/34719.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 273, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 6441, "action_date": "2015-02-11T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 34875, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/34875.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 273, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "F", "vote": {"vote_id": 18544, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [928, 887, 905, 936, 920, 934, 957], "Nay": [931, 917, 945, 958, 930, 904, 861, 926]}}, {"bill_id": 6441, "action_date": "2015-02-11T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 34875, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/34875.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to the 41st legislative day", "journal_page": 380, "committee_id_action": 273, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 18547, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [928, 887, 905, 936, 920, 934, 957], "Yea": [931, 917, 945, 958, 930, 904, 861, 926]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/6441"}
