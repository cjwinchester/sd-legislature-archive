The paid sick leave shall begin to accrue on the employee's ninety-first day of employment. The employee may use the paid sick leave for the employee, the employee's spouse, or the employee's child for: (1) Illness, injury, or health condition; (2) Medical diagnosis, care, or treatment for a mental or physical illness, injury, or health condition; or (3) Preventive medical care. The employee may use the paid sick leave when the employee is a victim of domestic abuse or sexual violence for obtaining medical or psychological care, obtaining services from a victim services organization, relocation, or for participation in any civil or criminal legal proceedings. The employer may require the employee to provide up to seven days notice of intent to use paid sick leave if the reason for taking the leave is foreseeable, and may require that the employee provide notice of intent to use paid sick leave as soon as practicable if the reason for taking the leave is not foreseeable. The employer may require the employee to provide documentation to verify the reason for taking sick leave if the leave is for three or more consecutive days. This Act applies to employers with fifty or more employees."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 8106, "action_date": "2017-01-25T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 43198, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/43198.pdf", "status_text": "First read in Senate and referred to", "journal_page": 200, "committee_id_action": 360, "committee_id_assigned": 340, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 8106, "action_date": "2017-02-06T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 43836, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/43836.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 340, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 8106, "action_date": "2017-02-06T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 43923, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/43923.pdf", "status_text": "Motion to amend", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 340, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 8106, "action_date": "2017-02-06T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 43923, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/43923.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass Amended", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 340, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "F", "vote": {"vote_id": 22894, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [1154, 1148, 1169, 1131, 1144, 1108], "Yea": [1105, 1102], "Excused": [1107]}}, {"bill_id": 8106, "action_date": "2017-02-06T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 43923, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/43923.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to the 41st legislative day", "journal_page": 309, "committee_id_action": 340, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 22896, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [1154, 1148, 1169, 1131, 1144, 1108], "Nay": [1105, 1102], "Excused": [1107]}}]}
