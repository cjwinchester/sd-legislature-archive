That subsection (d) of \u00a7 57A-3-110 be amended to read as follows: (d) If an instrument is payable to two or more persons alternatively, it is payable to any of them and may be negotiated, discharged, or enforced by any or all of them in possession of the instrument. If an instrument is payable to two or more persons not alternatively, it is payable to all of them and may be negotiated, discharged, or enforced only by all of them. If an instrument payable to two or more persons is ambiguous as to whether it is payable to the persons alternatively, the instrument is payable to the persons alternatively.

transfer."}, {"bill_id": 12869, "bill_version_id": 73117, "bill_version": "Enrolled", "bill_version_date": "1997-02-10T00:00:00-06:00", "bill_text": ""}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [],
