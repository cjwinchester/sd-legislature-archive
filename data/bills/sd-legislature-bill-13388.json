BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 35-4-78 be amended to read as follows: 35-4-78. No licensee may sell any alcoholic beverage: (1) To any person under the age of twenty-one years; or (2) To any person who is obviously intoxicated at the time. A violation of this section is a Class 1 misdemeanor. However, no licensee is civilly liable to any injured person or his estate for any injury suffered, including any action for wrongful death, or property damage suffered because of the intoxication of any person due to the sale of any alcoholic beverage in violation of the provisions of this section. Section 2. That chapter 35-4 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Any licensee that sells alcoholic beverages to a person under twenty-one years of age or a person obviously intoxicated is civilly liable for the death or injury of any person, or damage to any property, if such sale of alcoholic beverages constitutes the proximate cause of the death, injury, or property damage. Section 3. That \u00a7 35-11-1 be repealed. 35-11-1. The Legislature finds that the consumption of alcoholic beverages, rather than the serving of alcoholic beverages, is the proximate cause of any injury inflicted upon another by an intoxicated person. Therefore, the rule in Walz v. City of Hudson, 327 N.W. 2nd 120 (S.D. 1982) is hereby abrogated."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 13388, "action_date": "1998-01-26T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 76901, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/76901.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 232, "committee_id_action": 600, "committee_id_assigned": 598, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 13388, "action_date": "1998-02-11T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 76710, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/76710.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 598, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 13388, "action_date": "1998-02-11T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 76710, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/76710.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass,", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 598, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "F", "vote": {"vote_id": 38610, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [2141, 2134, 2114, 2128, 2109], "Nay": [2105, 2120, 2161, 2178, 2185, 2132, 2164, 2192]}}, {"bill_id": 13388, "action_date": "1998-02-11T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 76710, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/76710.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass,", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 598, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "F", "vote": {"vote_id": 38610, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [2141, 2134, 2114, 2128, 2109], "Nay": [2105, 2120, 2161, 2178, 2185, 2132, 2164, 2192]}}, {"bill_id": 13388, "action_date": "1998-02-11T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 76710, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/76710.pdf", "status_text": "Tabled", "journal_page": 553, "committee_id_action": 598, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 38612, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [2141, 2134, 2114, 2128, 2109], "Yea": [2105, 2120, 2161, 2178, 2185, 2132, 2164, 2192]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/13388"}
