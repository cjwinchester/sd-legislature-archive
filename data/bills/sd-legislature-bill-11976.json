Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of South Dakota: Section 1. That \u00a7 4-5-29.2 be AMENDED: 4-5-29.2. Education enhancement trust fund--Calculation of amount eligible for distribution--Transfer to general fund--Postsecondary scholarship grant programs. Pursuant to S.D. Const., Art. XII, \u00a7 6, the state investment officer shall determine the market value of the education enhancement trust fund as of December 31, 2003, and each calendar year thereafter less the investment expenses transferred pursuant to \u00a7 4-5-30. The state investment officer shall calculate an amount equal to four percent of that market value, without invading principal, as eligible for distribution, except for fiscal year 2021, the state investment officer shall calculate an amount equal to thirty-two million four hundred nineteen thousand nine hundred forty as eligible for distribution. For the purpose of this section, the term, principal, means the sum of all contributions to the fund. Beginning with the distribution in fiscal year 2008, the market value shall be determined by adding the market value of the trust fund at the end of the sixteen most recent calendar quarters as of December thirty-first, and dividing the sum by sixteen. Upon notice of that amount by the state investment officer, the state treasurer shall transfer the amount from the education enhancement trust fund to the state general fund as soon as practicable after July first of the next fiscal year. For fiscal year 2017, the portion of the transfer to the general fund for the postsecondary scholarship grant programs shall be $126,707.35. Beginning in fiscal year 2018, the portion of the transfer to the general fund for the postsecondary scholarship grant programs, shall be calculated by the state investment officer based on the relative share of the contributions made to the postsecondary scholarship grant fund created pursuant to \u00a7 13-55A-14 to the most recently calculated total fair value of the education enhancement fund including the contribution. The calculation shall be updated monthly to reflect any additional contributions to the education enhancement trust fund and the portion of the transfer to the general fund for the postsecondary scholarship grant programs shall be based on the average of the monthly calculation as of December thirty-first, using the months available for the first forty-eight months and then the most recent forty-eight calendar months thereafter."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 11976, "action_date": "2020-02-05T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 66255, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/66255.pdf", "status_text": "First Reading House", "journal_page": 169, "committee_id_action": 480, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 11976, "action_date": "2020-02-10T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 67155, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/67155.pdf", "status_text": "Referred to", "journal_page": 242, "committee_id_action": 480, "committee_id_assigned": 472, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 11976, "action_date": "2020-02-24T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 67977, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/67977.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 472, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 11976, "action_date": "2020-02-25T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 68186, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/68186.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 472, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 11976, "action_date": "2020-02-25T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 68187, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/68187.pdf", "status_text": "Tabled", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 472, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 33758, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [1700, 1702, 1748, 1678, 1733, 1701, 1660, 1684, 1690]}}]}
