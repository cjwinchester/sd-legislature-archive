BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That chapter 40-21 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Any person who violates any provision of chapter 40-20, 40-21, 40-22, or 40-29 is subject to a civil penalty to be imposed by the board, after notice and opportunity for hearing pursuant to chapter 1-26. The civil penalty is in addition to any criminal penalty, and may not exceed five thousand dollars for each violation. In determining the amount of the penalty, or the amount of a compromise settlement, upon finding a violation the board may consider the appropriateness of the penalty to the number of head of livestock involved, the gravity of the violation, prior offenses and compliance history, the good faith of the person charged in attempting to achieve compliance, and such other matters as justice may require. Any penalty collected pursuant to this chapter shall be deposited in the livestock ownership inspection and theft prevention fund. 250 copies of this document were printed by the South Dakota Legislative Research Council at a cost of $.04 per page. .
