With appropriate technological innovation, incentives, and investments, America's farms and ranches can become the factories that produce a new generation of fuels to help meet the nation's energy needs; and WHEREAS, \"25 by 25\" is an agriculturally led initiative that envisions America's farms and ranches producing twenty-five percent of America's energy demand by the year 2025 while continuing to produce abundant, safe, and affordable food, fiber, feed, and fuel; and WHEREAS, Agriculture's role as an energy producer will have a positive effect on national security and trade imbalances and will serve as a catalyst for rural development in South Dakota: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the House of Representatives of the Eighty- Third Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the Senate concurring therein, that the Legislature supports the vision of \"25 by 25\" whereby agriculture will provide twenty-five percent of the total energy consumed in the United States by the year 2025, while continuing to produce abundant, safe, and affordable food, fiber, feed, and fuel."}, {"bill_id": 462, "bill_version_id": 4100, "bill_version": "Enrolled", "bill_version_date": "2008-02-27T12:01:32.87-06:00", "bill_text": ""}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 462, "action_date": "2008-02-22T13:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 3824, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/3824.pdf", "status_text": "First Reading", "journal_page": 700, "committee_id_action": 27, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 462, "action_date": "2008-02-25T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 3927, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/3927.pdf", "status_text": "Adopt Resolution", "journal_page": 718, "committee_id_action": 27, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 2491, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [602, 579, 609, 614, 625, 593, 586, 570, 597, 532, 623, 574, 534, 555, 542, 568, 552, 575, 580, 572, 624, 595, 529, 594, 631, 565, 620, 616, 556, 585, 589, 633, 558, 605, 628, 630, 571, 581, 544, 546, 537, 536, 578, 612, 551, 599, 617, 554, 547, 583, 538, 603, 615, 600, 531, 563, 540, 566, 549, 619, 626, 611, 606, 587, 559, 564, 561, 591], "Nay": [608, 543]}}, {"bill_id": 462, "action_date": "2008-02-26T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 4020, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/4020.pdf", "status_text": "First Reading", "journal_page": 639, "committee_id_action": 28, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 462, "action_date": "2008-02-27T11:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 4108, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/4108.pdf", "status_text": "Concurred in Resolution", "journal_page": 661, "committee_id_action": 28, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 2607, "president_vote": null, "Excused": [557, 621], "Yea": [576, 604, 553, 596, 560, 590, 598, 545, 530, 601, 567, 535, 533, 582, 562, 622, 584, 569, 573, 618, 610, 629, 632, 577, 539, 627, 548, 550, 541, 607], "Nay": [592, 613, 588]}}]}
