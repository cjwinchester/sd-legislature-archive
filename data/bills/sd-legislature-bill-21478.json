As used in this Act, a school district with critical need for capital construction is one which: (1) Has an urgent need for a new academic building or for a replacement of an academic building due to a catastrophe or due to condemnation by the state fire marshal for structural concerns; and (2) Levies taxes at the maximum levels prescribed in \u00a7 13-6-7 and still does not have the ability to raise local effort sufficient enough to build or acquire adequate, permanent academic building space. Section 3. Any school district seeking financial assistance through the facility equity fund shall apply to the secretary of education. The application shall document the district's critical need and include the district's plan to add or replace the academic building. Section 4. There is hereby created the Facility Equity Fund Oversight Board within the Department of Education. The board shall consist of five members appointed by the Governor.

Only those school districts whose applications are approved by the Facility Equity Fund Oversight Board are eligible to receive funds from the facility equity fund. Section 5.
