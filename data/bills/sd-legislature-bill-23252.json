Section 2. The Board of Regents shall determine and allocate an amount for each postsecondary educational institution under its control from the appropriation in section 1 of this Act. Any postsecondary educational institution that increases tuition or fees for the fall 2022 and spring 2023 academic semesters is not eligible to receive moneys appropriated in section 1 of this Act. If a postsecondary educational institution becomes ineligible to receive the money appropriated in section 1 of this Act, the Board of Regents must immediately revert the money allocated for the postsecondary educational institution back to the general fund. Section 3. The executive director of the Board of Regents shall approve vouchers and the state auditor shall draw warrants to pay expenditures authorized by this Act. Section 4. Any amounts appropriated in this Act not lawfully expended, reverted, or obligated by June 30, 2026, shall revert in accordance with the procedures prescribed in chapter 4-8. Section 5.
