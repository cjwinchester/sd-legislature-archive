WHEREAS, with each passing year this nation becomes deeper in debt as federal government expenditures repeatedly exceed available revenue, so that the federal public debt is now approximately $7.6 trillion, or $25,800 for each man, woman, and child; and WHEREAS, the annual federal budget has risen to unprecedented levels, demonstrating an unwillingness or inability of both the Legislative and Executive branches of federal government to control the federal debt; and WHEREAS, fiscal irresponsibility at the federal level, resulting in a lower standard of living and endangering economic opportunity now and for the next generation, is possibly the greatest threat that faces our nation; and WHEREAS, Thomas Jefferson recognized the importance of a balanced budget when he wrote, \"The question whether one generation has the right to bind another by the deficit it imposes is a question of such consequence as to place it among the fundamental principles of government. We should consider ourselves unauthorized to saddle posterity with our debts, and morally bound to pay them ourselves.\"; and WHEREAS, the principal functions of the United States Constitution include promoting the broadest principles of a government of, by, and for the people; setting forth the most fundamental responsibilities of government; and enumerating and limiting the powers of the government to protect the basic rights of the people; and WHEREAS, the federal government's unlimited ability to borrow involves decisions of such magnitude, with such potentially profound consequences for the nation and its people, today and in the future, that it is an appropriate subject for limitation by the United States Constitution; and WHEREAS, the United States Constitution vests the ultimate responsibility to approve or disapprove of amendments to the United States Constitution with the people of the several states, as represented by their elected legislatures: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the House of Representatives of the Eightieth Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the Senate concurring therein, that the Legislature of the State of South Dakota requests the members of the Congress of the United States to expeditiously pass, and to propose to the legislatures of the several states for ratification, an amendment to the United States Constitution requiring, in the absence of a national emergency, that the total of all federal appropriations made by the Congress for any fiscal year not exceed the total of all estimated federal revenue for that fiscal year; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Legislatures of each of the several states comprising the United States be urged to apply to the Congress requesting the proposal for ratification of a balanced budget amendment to the United States Constitution."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 19629, "action_date": "2005-03-01T13:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 105710, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/105710.pdf", "status_text": "Introduced", "journal_page": 715, "committee_id_action": 860, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 19629, "action_date": "2005-03-02T11:30:00-06:00", "document_id": 105772, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/105772.pdf", "status_text": "Tabled", "journal_page": 756, "committee_id_action": 860, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 62189, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [3155, 3156, 3158, 3159, 3160, 3161, 3162, 3164, 3167, 3169, 3170, 3171, 3172, 3174, 3175, 3176, 3177, 3178, 3181, 3182, 3183, 3184, 3187, 3188, 3189, 3190, 3191, 3192, 3194, 3195, 3196, 3197, 3199, 3203, 3206, 3207, 3208, 3209, 3211, 3213, 3216, 3218, 3220, 3222, 3223, 3225, 3226, 3227, 3230, 3231, 3232, 3233, 3234, 3235, 3237, 3238, 3240, 3243, 3244, 3245, 3246, 3248, 3249, 3251, 3252, 3253, 3254, 3255, 3215], "Excused": [3229]}}, {"bill_id": 19629, "action_date": "2005-03-02T11:30:00-06:00", "document_id": 105772, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/105772.pdf", "status_text": "Tabled", "journal_page": 756, "committee_id_action": 860, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 62189, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [3155, 3156, 3158, 3159, 3160, 3161, 3162, 3164, 3167, 3169, 3170, 3171, 3172, 3174, 3175, 3176, 3177, 3178, 3181, 3182, 3183, 3184, 3187, 3188, 3189, 3190, 3191, 3192, 3194, 3195, 3196, 3197, 3199, 3203, 3206, 3207, 3208, 3209, 3211, 3213, 3216, 3218, 3220, 3222, 3223, 3225, 3226, 3227, 3230, 3231, 3232, 3233, 3234, 3235, 3237, 3238, 3240, 3243, 3244, 3245, 3246, 3248, 3249, 3251, 3252, 3253, 3254, 3255, 3215], "Excused": [3229]}}]}
