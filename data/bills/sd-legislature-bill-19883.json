WHEREAS, January is National Mentoring Month which is a project organized by the Harvard Mentoring Project and MENTOR/National Mentoring Partnership that began in January 2002; and WHEREAS, National Mentoring Month attempts to raise awareness of mentoring in its various forms, recruit individuals to be mentors, and promote the rapid growth of mentoring by recruiting organizations to engage their constituents in mentoring; and WHEREAS, large numbers of our nation's youth face difficult circumstances: one in four live in single-parent homes, one in ten is born to teen-aged parents, one in five lives in poverty, and one in ten will not finish high school; and WHEREAS, mentoring has been shown to combat these problems by matching a caring, responsible adult with a child to provide guidance, stability, confidence, and direction for the child, which can result in improved school attendance and graduation rates and decreasing involvement with substance abuse and violent behavior; and WHEREAS, it is estimated that 17.6 million young people in the United States are in need of mentoring, while a National Mentoring Poll indicates that 57 million American adults would consider mentoring young people, which identifies the need to find methods of matching available mentoring resources with those who would benefit from a mentoring program; and WHEREAS, an expanded mentoring program in South Dakota would be a valuable resource for many of our state's young people and would benefit all of our communities; and WHEREAS, mentoring in South Dakota would be enhanced through the formation of a State Mentoring Partnership for South Dakota and affiliation with the National Mentoring Partnership: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the Senate of the Eightieth Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the House of Representatives concurring therein, that the South Dakota Legislature supports and encourages the establishment and enhancement of mentoring programs for the young people of this state; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the South Dakota Legislature supports the formation of a South Dakota State Mentoring Partnership and affiliation of South Dakota mentoring programs with the National Mentoring Partnership."}, {"bill_id": 19883, "bill_version_id": 103959, "bill_version": "Enrolled", "bill_version_date": "2005-02-03T08:24:25-06:00", "bill_text": ""}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 19883, "action_date": "2005-01-26T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 103314, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/103314.pdf", "status_text": "Introduced", "journal_page": 184, "committee_id_action": 861, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 19883, "action_date": "2005-01-27T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 103467, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/103467.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to another day", "journal_page": 199, "committee_id_action": 861, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 19883, "action_date": "2005-01-31T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 103721, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/103721.pdf", "status_text": "Adopt Resolution", "journal_page": 240, "committee_id_action": 861, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 61323, "president_vote": null, "Excused": [3150, 3152, 3198], "Yea": [3151, 3153, 3154, 3157, 3163, 3165, 3166, 3168, 3173, 3179, 3180, 3185, 3186, 3193, 3200, 3201, 3202, 3204, 3205, 3210, 3212, 3214, 3217, 3219, 3221, 3224, 3228, 3236, 3239, 3241, 3242, 3247]}}, {"bill_id": 19883, "action_date": "2005-02-02T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 103940, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/103940.pdf", "status_text": "Concur In resolution", "journal_page": 290, "committee_id_action": 860, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 61883, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [3155, 3156, 3158, 3159, 3160, 3161, 3162, 3164, 3167, 3169, 3170, 3171, 3172, 3174, 3175, 3177, 3178, 3181, 3182, 3183, 3184, 3187, 3188, 3189, 3190, 3192, 3194, 3195, 3196, 3197, 3199, 3203, 3206, 3207, 3208, 3211, 3213, 3216, 3218, 3220, 3222, 3223, 3225, 3226, 3227, 3229, 3230, 3231, 3232, 3233, 3234, 3235, 3237, 3238, 3240, 3243, 3244, 3245, 3246, 3249, 3251, 3252, 3253, 3254, 3255, 3215], "Excused": [3176, 3191, 3209, 3248]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/19883"}
