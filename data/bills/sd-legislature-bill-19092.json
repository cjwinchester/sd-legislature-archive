BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 1-16G-12 be repealed. 1-16G-12. For purposes of \u00a7 \u00a7 1-16G-12 to 1-16G-18, inclusive, \"seed capital fund\" means a for-profit investment vehicle or entity which intends to invest as an owner in businesses for the purpose of achieving profit through growth. Section 2. That \u00a7 1-16G-13 be repealed. 1-16G-13. In addition to the loans authorized in \u00a7 \u00a7 1-16G-5 and 1-16G-8, the Board of Economic Development may award loans from the revolving economic development and initiative fund to seed capital funds. The total amount of such loans may not exceed two million dollars. Such loans shall be at the same interest rate as for other loans made from the revolving economic development and initiative fund pursuant to this chapter, but need not meet the other requirements established pursuant to \u00a7 \u00a7 1-16G-5 and 1-16G-8 for other loans from the revolving economic development and initiative fund. Such loans shall be interest-only for the first five years. Section 3. That \u00a7 1-16G-14 be repealed. 1-16G-14.

The Board of Economic Development may make loan commitments to eligible applicants following receipt of an application consistent with the criteria specified in \u00a7 \u00a7 1-16G-12 to 1-16G-18, inclusive. No loan may be awarded unless the board has assured itself that the following conditions hold: (1) At least two dollars of private investment have been committed to the seed capital fund for every one dollar of the loan awarded; (2) Except for reserves, investments from the seed capital fund shall be made in businesses located primarily in this state and conducting operations primarily in this state. For the purposes of this section, businesses include international export related services, international export related mercantile ventures, advanced technology or computer related ventures that will increase the state's share of domestic or international markets and ventures for the development of new products, the processing of agricultural products, the development of energy sources or the recycling of solid waste and other business operations; and (3) Eligible seed capital funds shall be limited partnerships or corporations, and shall invest in such a way as to ensure that the revolving economic development and initiative fund shall assume no liability and be subject to no losses in excess of the amount of its original loan. Section 5. That \u00a7 1-16G-16 be repealed. 1-16G-16. The loan recipient shall make no distributions in cash or in kind to its equity investors until the REDI fund loan is repaid in full, or a waiver is granted by the REDI fund.

The fund receiving the REDI fund loan may not thereafter make distributions to its owners in cash or in kind, in excess of the original cash invested plus six percent per year, not compounded, without first paying bonus interest to the REDI fund equal to an aggregate additional return of six percent per year, not compounded, for the entire period from the date the loan was granted until it was repaid. Section 6. That \u00a7 1-16G-17 be repealed. 1-16G-17. The Board of Economic Development shall promulgate rules pursuant to chapter 1-26 to establish criteria for loan and investment eligibility, application and award procedures, and reporting requirements and procedures for the seed capital loan program established pursuant to \u00a7 \u00a7 1-16G-12 to 1-16G-18, inclusive. Section 7. That \u00a7 1-16G-18 be repealed. 1-16G-18. Recipients of seed capital loans pursuant to \u00a7 \u00a7 1-16G-12 to 1-16G-18, inclusive, shall submit annual reports to the Board of Economic Development. The reports shall include the policies and procedures of the seed capital fund, the amount of private investment in the fund and the number, types and amounts of investment in firms by the fund. In addition, recipients shall provide copies of all reports and correspondence intended for equity investors in the fund. Section 8.
