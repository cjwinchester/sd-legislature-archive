WHEREAS, the Congress of the United States, acknowledging the fiscal burden placed on local educational agencies by the loss of revenue from traditional funding sources such as property, sales, and income taxes resulting from a federal presence, in 1950 enacted Public Law 81-874 and Public Law 81-815 authorizing the Impact Aid Program that was reauthorized in 1994 as Sections 8002 and 8003 of Title VIII of Public Law 103-382 (20 U.S.C. Section 236 and following); and WHEREAS, federal impact aid is funding provided to a local school district in lieu of taxes not paid by the federal government, the largest owner of land in the State of South Dakota, and certain federal employees and to compensate for revenues the local community would collect if the land did not belong to the federal government;

and WHEREAS, the withdrawal of federal impact aid funding would result in state and local taxpayers subsidizing the education of the federally connected child; and WHEREAS, South Dakota and its citizens are struggling to overcome a severe economic crisis; and WHEREAS, the federal government's financial support for South Dakota's federally connected child and federal presence has declined below the 1981 level of funding although the numbers of children in the educational system and federal acres has not: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the House of Representatives of the Seventy- second Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the Senate concurring therein, that the Legislature of the State of South Dakota proclaims its support for the maintenance and full funding of federal impact aid to local school districts and respectfully memorializes the President and Congress of the United States to uphold the responsibility of the federal government to provide funding to local school districts impacted by a federal presence."}, {"bill_id": 13129, "bill_version_id": 74228, "bill_version": "Enrolled", "bill_version_date": "1997-02-26T00:00:00-06:00", "bill_text": "February 18, 1997 February 24, 1997"}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 13129, "action_date": "1997-02-18T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 72916, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/72916.pdf", "status_text": "Adopt Resolution", "journal_page": 531, "committee_id_action": 544, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 37715, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [1886, 1887, 1888, 1890, 1891, 1892, 1894, 1895, 1896, 1897, 1898, 1899, 1900, 1902, 1903, 1904, 1906, 1907, 1909, 1910, 1913, 1914, 1916, 1917, 1918, 1921, 1922, 1923, 1926, 1929, 1931, 1933, 1934, 1936, 1937, 1940, 1941, 1942, 1943, 1944, 1947, 1948, 1949, 1950, 1951, 1952, 1953, 1954, 1957, 1958, 1961, 1962, 1963, 1964, 1966, 1967, 1968, 1970, 1971, 1973, 1974, 1975, 1980, 1982, 1983, 1984, 1985, 1987, 1988, 1924]}}, {"bill_id": 13129, "action_date": "1997-02-24T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 72428, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/72428.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 527, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 13129, "action_date": "1997-02-24T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 72428, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/72428.pdf", "status_text": "Concur In resolution", "journal_page": 594, "committee_id_action": 527, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 35268, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [1911, 1915, 1956, 1912, 1930, 1946, 1986, 1969, 1927]}}, {"bill_id": 13129, "action_date": "1997-02-24T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 72428, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/72428.pdf", "status_text": "Place on Consent Calendar", "journal_page": 594, "committee_id_action": 527, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 13129, "action_date": "1997-02-25T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 72927, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/72927.pdf", "status_text": "Concur In resolution", "journal_page": 630, "committee_id_action": 545, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 35287, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [1884, 1885, 1889, 1893, 1901, 1905, 1908, 1911, 1912, 1915, 1919, 1920, 1925, 1927, 1928, 1930, 1932, 1935, 1938, 1939, 1945, 1946, 1956, 1959, 1960, 1965, 1969, 1972, 1976, 1977, 1978, 1979, 1986], "Excused": [1955, 1981]}}]}
