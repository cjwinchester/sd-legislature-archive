Any such station may be used for establishing a survey connection to either South Dakota coordinate system. If the values are expressed in feet, a definition of one foot equals 0.3048 meter exactly is used as the standard foot for the South Dakota state plane coordinate system. One of the two distances, to be known as the east or x-coordinate, gives the distance east of the y-axis; the other, to be known as the north or y-coordinate, gives the distance north of the x-axis.

For purposes of describing the location of any survey station or land boundary corner in the state, it is a complete, legal, and satisfactory description of the location to give the position of the survey station or land boundary corner on the system of plane coordinates defined in this chapter. Whenever coordinates based on the South Dakota state plane coordinate system are used to describe any tract of land that in the same document is also described by reference to any subdivision, line, or corner of the United States Public Lands Survey, the description by coordinates must be construed as supplemental to the basic description of the subdivision, line, or corner contained in the official plats and field notes filed of record, and in the event of any conflict, the description by reference to the subdivision, line, or corner of the United States Public Lands Survey prevails over the description by coordinates. Section 10. That \u00a7 43-22-13 be AMENDED: 43-22-13. Nothing contained in this chapter requires a purchaser, mortgagee, or insurer of real property to rely wholly on a land description, any part of which depends exclusively upon the South Dakota state plane coordinate system. Section 11. That chapter 43-22 be amended with a NEW SECTION: The provisions of this chapter may not be construed to prohibit the appropriate use of other geodetic reference networks. Section 12. That \u00a7 43-22-3 be REPEALED. Section 13. That \u00a7 43-22-4 be REPEALED. Section 14. That \u00a7 43-22-14 be REPEALED.
