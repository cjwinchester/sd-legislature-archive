The disposition directions and funeral prearrangements that are contained in a preneed contract are not subject to cancellation or substantial revision unless the cancellation or substantial revision has been ordered by a person who the decedent has appointed in the preneed contract as the person authorized to cancel or revise the terms of the preneed contract, or unless any resources set aside to fund the preneed contract are insufficient under the terms of the preneed contract to carry out the disposition directions and funeral prearrangements contained therein. Section 2. That a NEW SECTION be added to title 55: Except as provided in section 3 of this Act, the right to control the disposition of the remains of a deceased person, the location, manner and conditions of disposition, and arrangements for funeral goods and services to be provided vests in the following, in the order named, provided such person is 18 years or older and is of sound mind: (1) A person designated by the decedent as the person with the right to control the disposition in an affidavit executed in accordance with section 4 of this Act; (2) A person designated in the federal Record of Emergency Date Form DD 93, or its successor form, to have the right of disposition by a member of the military who dies while under active-duty orders, as described in 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 1481, in effect on January 1, 2022; (3) The surviving spouse; (4) The sole surviving child of the decedent, or if there is more than one child of the decedent, the majority of the surviving children.

If one of the surviving parents is absent, the remaining parent is vested with the rights and duties of this section after reasonable efforts have been unsuccessful in locating the absent surviving parent; (6) The surviving brother or sister of the decedent, or if there is more than one sibling of the decedent, the majority of the surviving siblings.

Section 3. That a NEW SECTION be added to title 55: A person entitled under law to the right of disposition forfeits that right, and the right is passed on to the next qualifying person as listed in section 2 of this Act, in the following circumstances: (1) Any person charged with first- or second-degree murder or voluntary manslaughter in connection with the decedent\u2019s death, and whose charges are known to the funeral director; provided, however that if the charges against the person are dismissed, or if the person is acquitted of the charges, the right of disposition is returned to the person; (2) Any person who does not exercise the person's right of disposition within two days of notification of the death of decedent or within three days of decedent\u2019s death, whichever is earlier; (3) If the person and the decedent are spouses and a petition to dissolve the marriage is pending at the time of decedent\u2019s death; or (4) Where the court, pursuant to section 5 of this Act, determines that the person entitled to the right of disposition and the decedent were estranged at the time of death. For purposes of this subdivision, the term, estranged, means a physical and emotional separation from the decedent at the time of death that has existed for a period of time that clearly demonstrates an absence of due affection, trust, and regard for the decedent. Section 4. That a NEW SECTION be added to title 55: A person who is 18 years or older and of sound mind wishing to authorize another person to control the disposition of his or her remains as referenced in section 2 of this Act, may execute an affidavit before a notary public in substantially the following form: State of _______________ } County of ______________ } I, __________________, do hereby designate ____________________ with the right to control the disposition of my remains upon my death.

That a NEW SECTION be added to title 55: Notwithstanding sections 1 to 4, inclusive, of this Act, the court of the county where the decedent resided may award the right of disposition to the person determined by the court to be the most fit and appropriate to carry out the right of disposition, and may make decisions regarding the decedent\u2019s remains if those sharing the right of disposition cannot agree. The following provisions apply to the court\u2019s determination: (1) If the persons holding the right of disposition are two or more persons with the same relationship to the decedent, and they cannot, by majority vote, make a decision regarding the disposition of the decedent\u2019s remains, any of the persons or a funeral home with custody of the remains may file a petition asking the probate court to make a determination in the matter; (2) In making a determination under this section, the probate court shall consider the following: (a) The reasonableness and practicality of the proposed funeral arrangements and disposition; (b) The degree of the personal relationship between the decedent and each of the persons claiming the right of disposition; (c) The desires of the person or persons who are ready, able, and willing to pay the cost of the funeral arrangements and disposition; (d) The convenience and needs of other families and friends wishing to pay respects; (e) The desires of the decedent; and (f) The degree to which the funeral arrangements would allow maximum participation by all wishing to pay respect; (3) In the event of a dispute regarding the right of disposition, a funeral home is not liable for refusing to accept the remains or to inter or otherwise dispose of the remains of the decedent or complete the arrangements for the final disposition of the remains until the funeral home receives a court order or other written agreement signed by the parties in the disagreement that decides the final disposition of the remains. If the funeral home retains the remains for final disposition while the parties are in disagreement, the funeral home may embalm or refrigerate and shelter the body, or both, in order to preserve it while awaiting the final decision of the court and may add the cost of embalming and refrigeration and sheltering to the final disposition costs. If a funeral home brings an action under this section, the funeral home may add the legal fees and court costs associated with a petition under this section to the cost of final disposition. This section may not be construed to require or to impose a duty upon a funeral home to bring an action under this section. A funeral home and its employees may not be held criminally or civilly liable for choosing not to bring an action under this section; and (4) Except to the degree it may be considered by the court under subsection (2)(c), the fact that a person has paid or agreed to pay for all or part of the funeral arrangements and final disposition does not give that person a greater right to the right of disposition than the person would otherwise have. The personal representative of the estate of the decedent does not, by virtue of being the personal representative, have a greater claim to the right of disposition than the person would otherwise have. Section 6. That a NEW SECTION be added to title 55: Any person signing a funeral service agreement, cremation authorization form, or any other authorization for disposition is deemed to warrant the truthfulness of any facts set forth therein, including the identity of the decedent whose remains are to be buried, cremated, or otherwise disposed of, and the party\u2019s authority to order the disposition. A funeral home shall have the right to rely on the funeral service contract or authorization and shall have the authority to carry out the instructions of the person or persons whom the funeral home reasonably believes holds the right of disposition. The funeral home shall have no responsibility to contact or to independently investigate the existence of any next-of-kin or relative of the decedent. If there is more than one person in a class who is equal in priority and the funeral home has no knowledge of any objection by other members of such class, the funeral home shall be entitled to rely on and act according to the instructions of the first such person in the class to make funeral and disposition arrangements; provided that no other person in such class objects in writing to the funeral home. Section 7. That a NEW SECTION be added to title 55: No funeral home or funeral director who relies in good faith upon the instructions of an individual claiming the right of disposition shall be subject to criminal or civil liability or subject to disciplinary action for carrying out the disposition of the remains in accordance with the instructions."}, {"bill_id": 22962, "bill_version_id": 233085, "bill_version": "House Judiciary Engrossed", "bill_version_date": "2022-02-09T17:05:48.93-06:00", "bill_text": "An Act to establish rights regarding the disposition of a person's remains.
