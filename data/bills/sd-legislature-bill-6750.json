Section 2. Before implementing any digital-learning platform, any school accredited by the state shall provide to any student who is eighteen years of age or older, or to the parent or guardian of any minor student, a formal written explanation of the goals and capabilities of the platform, including of any software, whether the software is loaded onto the platform or hosted externally by a third party. The formal written explanation shall include an understandable description of: (1) How the platform works and the platform's principal purpose or purposes; (2) The title and business address of the school official who is responsible for the platform, and the name and business address of any contractor or outside party maintaining the platform for or on behalf of the school; (3) The information the software is designed to collect from any student or capture and record about any student, including any data matches with other personally identifiable student information; (4) Every element of data that the platform or software will collect or record about any student, including personal psychological characteristics; noncognitive attributes or skills such as collaboration, resilience, and perseverance; and physiological measurements; (5) The purpose of collecting and recording the data; (6) Every contemplated use or disclosure of the data, the categories of recipients, and the purpose of any use or disclosure; (7) A full explanation of the privacy policy maintained by the digital-learning provider; and (8) The policies and practices of the school regarding storage, retrievability, access controls, retention, and disposal of the records collected and recorded by the platform. Section 3. No digital-learning platform may be used in any school accredited by the state unless the platform includes a portal or other mechanism allowing parents access to the platform and to all the content available to the students using the platform. Any data of any type collected on a student through a student's use of a digital-learning platform shall be destroyed at the end of the course for which the platform is used. Section 4. Unless a school accredited by the state certifies that the platform is essential to the school's educational mission and provides an explanation for the basis of that certification, a student who has reached the age of eighteen, or the parent or guardian of a minor student, may opt out of the use of any digital-learning platform."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 6750, "action_date": "2015-01-30T13:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 34236, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/34236.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 247, "committee_id_action": 286, "committee_id_assigned": 273, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 6750, "action_date": "2015-02-20T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 35157, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/35157.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 273, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 6750, "action_date": "2015-02-20T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 35340, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/35340.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 273, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "F", "vote": {"vote_id": 18890, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [928, 887, 905, 920, 957], "Nay": [931, 917, 945, 958, 936, 930, 904, 934, 861, 926]}}, {"bill_id": 6750, "action_date": "2015-02-20T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 35340, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/35340.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to the 41st legislative day", "journal_page": 467, "committee_id_action": 273, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 18892, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [928, 887, 905, 920, 957], "Yea": [931, 917, 945, 958, 936, 930, 904, 934, 861, 926]}}]}
