The request shall be made in writing to the board not later than August 1 and shall include a legal description of the land on which the tree is located and a description of the tree. If the board grants the request, the tree is exempted from the requirements of \u00a7 31-31-2 for the current year and for future years.

Every statutory section-line highway shall be sixty-six feet wide and shall be taken equally from each side of the section line, unless changed as provided in this title , but nothing herein contained shall prevent .
