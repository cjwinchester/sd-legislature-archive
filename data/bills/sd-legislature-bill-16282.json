Except as provided in \u00a7 41-9-2, no person may fish, hunt, or trap upon any another person's private land not his own or in his possession or upon any water or ice covering another person's private land without permission from the owner or lessee of such land. No person violating this section may be convicted of trespass if the person did not have actual or constructive knowledge that the land was private. If the person has been told, informed, or notified that land, including land inundated by water or covered by ice, is private, whether by the landowner, lessee, law enforcement officer, area resident, or any other person of probity, then, with regard to any future trespass, the person so informed or notified, has actual knowledge. Constructive knowledge that land, including land inundated by water or covered by ice, is private may be inferred from posting, fencing, the presence of crops, livestock, or buildings, or other physical indicia of private ownership. A violation of this section is a Class 2 misdemeanor and is subject to \u00a7 41-9-8."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 16282, "action_date": "2001-01-23T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 88299, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/88299.pdf", "status_text": "First read in Senate and referred to", "journal_page": 170, "committee_id_action": 713, "committee_id_assigned": 686, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 16282, "action_date": "2001-01-25T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 88604, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/88604.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 686, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 16282, "action_date": "2001-01-25T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 88604, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/88604.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to another day", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 686, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 16282, "action_date": "2001-01-30T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 88946, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/88946.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 686, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 16282, "action_date": "2001-01-30T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 88946, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/88946.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass,", "journal_page": 275, "committee_id_action": 686, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 50890, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [2531, 2535, 2551, 2534], "Yea": [2552, 2562, 2598, 2606, 2609]}}, {"bill_id": 16282, "action_date": "2001-01-31T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 89083, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/89083.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass,", "journal_page": 306, "committee_id_action": 713, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "F", "vote": {"vote_id": 51001, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [2516, 2517, 2520, 2523, 2524, 2529, 2531, 2534, 2535, 2536, 2542, 2549, 2551, 2569, 2576, 2580, 2581, 2584, 2585, 2590, 2597, 2616, 2617], "Yea": [2532, 2539, 2552, 2562, 2567, 2573, 2598, 2606, 2607, 2609, 2615], "Excused": [2550]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/16282"}
