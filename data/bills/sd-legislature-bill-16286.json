BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That chapter 10-13 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: If a farm or ranch is owned and operated by an individual or individuals to produce gross derived income from the farm or ranch as defined in \u00a7 61 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended on January 1, 2001, the individual or individuals may request that the farm or ranch be classified as an owner-operated farm pursuant to this Act. An owner-operated farm may be organized in any legal form authorized by South Dakota law. The individual or individuals shall own one hundred percent of the owner-operated farm and the individual or individuals are, or were before retirement, actively operating the farm or ranch as their primary economic activity. Primary economic activity means that all the individuals spend, or spent before retirement, a majority of their time working on such farm or ranch, that this activity is the owner's primary source of income, and the owner shares in the risk of producing agricultural products and is entitled to share in the agricultural products available for marketing from the farm or ranch. For purposes of this Act, an owner-operated farm property is any building, structure, or land which is owned by all the owners of the owner-operated farm and assessed and taxed as a separate unit. If the owner operates the farm or ranch in less than one hundred percent of the property, the portion of the property so used by the owner shall be classified as an owner-operated farm. For the purposes of this Act an individual is a natural person. Section 2. That chapter 10-13 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: To be eligible for a property tax classification as an owner-operated farm pursuant to this Act, all the owners of such farm or ranch shall submit a certificate prescribed by the Department of Revenue, signed by each owner under oath, to the county director of equalization stating such individual or individuals are the owners of the property on the legal assessment date and meet the requirements of this Act. The owner shall sign the certificate under penalty of perjury and shall submit the certificate by March fifteenth. The owner shall notify the director of equalization if a change in eligibility for this classification occurs. The director of equalization may request the owner or owners to supply any information the director deems necessary to establish the classification. If the director of equalization classifies the property as an owner-operated farm, the property shall retain this classification until such time that the owner's eligibility for this classification changes. If the director has questions as to the continued compliance with the requirements to maintain this property tax classification, the director of equalization may require evidence of compliance from the owner or owners. Section 3. That chapter 10-13 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Any individual or individuals who receive an owner-operated farm classification by misrepresenting the facts concerning ownership or eligibility for such classification shall be assessed a penalty equal to five dollars per thousand dollars of valuation on the property, which assessment shall become a perpetual lien on the property pursuant to \u00a7 10-21-33. The individual or individuals shall be barred from receiving the owner-operated farm classification for any property in the state for the following five years. Section 4.

However, the board of county commissioners may increase the minimum acre requirement up to one hundred sixty acres. However, for tax purposes, land is not agricultural land if the land is classified pursuant to \u00a7 10-6-33.14 as a nonagricultural acreage. Section 5. That chapter 10-6 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: For tax purposes, land is class 2 agricultural property if it meets two of the following three criteria: (1) At least thirty-three and one-third percent of the total family gross income of the owner is derived from the pursuit of agriculture as defined in subdivision (2) of this section or it is a state-owned public shooting area or a state-owned game production area as identified in \u00a7 41-4-8 and it is owned and managed by the Department of Game, Fish and Parks; (2) Its principal use is devoted to the raising and harvesting of crops or timber or fruit trees, the rearing, feeding, and management of farm livestock, poultry, fish, or nursery stock, the production of bees and apiary products, or horticulture, all for intended profit pursuant to subdivision (1) of this section.
