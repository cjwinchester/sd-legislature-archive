However, no tax may be levied on the sale, use, storage, and consumption of items taxed pursuant to the provisions of chapters 10-45 and 10-46, unless the tax conforms in all respects to the state tax on such items with the exception of the rate, and the rate levied pursuant to this section does not exceed one percent. The governing board shall specify in the ordinance the proposed use for the tax. The use specified in the ordinance shall be for capital expenditures or refunds not provided for under the existing sources of revenue or budget. The term, capital expenditures, includes land acquisition, professional fees, construction costs, and other fixed assets for the project, facility, municipal utilities, streets, or structure. A portion of the tax revenue collected pursuant to this section may be refunded to the citizens of the municipality pursuant to a methodology specified in the ordinance. The governing board shall specify in the ordinance the year or number of years the tax will be applied and the date the tax will end. If sufficient tax revenue is collected or projected to be collected to pay for the capital expenditures before the end date specified in the ordinance, the tax shall be repealed at a date in accordance with the provisions of \u00a7 10-52-9. No tax levied pursuant to this section may be extended or renewed, unless the governing body adopts a new ordinance and receives approval from the voters. Any ordinance adopted pursuant to this section shall be referred to a vote of the people for its approval or disapproval. Section 2. That \u00a7 10-52-2.10 be amended to read: 10-52-2.10.

For bonds issued prior to before January 1, 2004, the proceeds of the bonds may be used for land acquisition, the funding of public ambulances and medical emergency response vehicles, public hospitals or nonprofit hospitals with fifty or fewer licensed beds, and other public health care facilities or nonprofit health care facilities with fifty or fewer licensed beds, capital asset acquisition and capital improvements, to establish a debt service reserve fund for the bonds and to pay not more than one year's capitalized interest on the bonds.
