BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That chapter 41-6 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: The Department of Game, Fish and Parks shall provide for the issuance of a lifetime hunting and fishing license to any resident of South Dakota who meets the qualifications set forth in this Act. The lifetime hunting and fishing license allows the holder of the license the same rights and privileges as provided by a South Dakota resident fishing license and a South Dakota resident small game hunting license. The lifetime hunting and fishing license may not be used as proof of residency for other licenses issued by the department. Any person is eligible to receive a lifetime hunting and fishing license if the person is a South Dakota resident. For the purposes of this section, the term, resident, means a person who has maintained and lived in a place of permanent abode in the state for a period of one year immediately preceding the person's application for the license. The term, place of permanent abode, does not include mere ownership of property or the possession of a postal box in the state for the sole purpose of receiving mail. Section 2. That chapter 41-6 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: The lifetime hunting and fishing license may be issued or replaced directly by the Department of Game, Fish and Parks, including issuance or replacement of the license via electronic means, or by a license agent. No fee may be charged by the department for the replacement of a lost license. However, if the license is issued or replaced by a license agent, the agent may charge an issuance or replacement fee not to exceed two dollars. The minimum fees for the issuance of a lifetime hunting and fishing license based on the age of the applicant at the time of issuance are as follows: The commission, by rules promulgated pursuant to chapter 1-26, may increase annually the minimum fees set by this section based on the consumer price index for urban wage earners and clerical workers calculated by the United States Bureau of Labor Statistics. Money generated by the fee for the issuance of each lifetime hunting and fishing license shall be deposited in the lifetime fish and wildlife trust fund created pursuant to section 3 of this Act. Section 3. There is hereby created in the state treasury the lifetime fish and wildlife trust fund. Any money collected for the issuance of a lifetime license pursuant to this Act shall be deposited in this fund. The principal of this fund may not be spent. The annual interest earned on this fund is continuously appropriated to the Game, Fish and Parks Commission to be used as part of the department's annual operating budget. Section 4. That chapter 41-6 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: The Game, Fish and Parks Commission shall promulgate rules pursuant to chapter 1-26 pertaining to lifetime hunting and fishing licenses as provided in this section. The rules shall specify license application and replacement procedures and requirements, requirements governing the use of the licenses, procedures for the collection of fees, and procedures and criteria for the suspension or revocation of licenses. Section 5. Any lifetime license issued pursuant to this Act remains valid if the license holder moved out of the state. However, no holder of a lifetime license who has moved out of the state is eligible for a resident big game drawing, resident turkey license, or resident waterfowl license. Such license holder shall apply for those licenses during the periods open to a nonresident for a nonresident license. Section 6. If a person with a lifetime hunting license and while a legal resident of the state wants to hunt waterfowl, the person shall have in possession the federal waterfowl stamp and the state migratory bird certification stamp. No stamps need be affixed to the lifetime license. However, the stamps shall be otherwise carried on the hunter."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 1842, "action_date": "2010-01-28T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 11385, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/11385.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 220, "committee_id_action": 86, "committee_id_assigned": 87, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 1842, "action_date": "2010-02-11T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 11958, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/11958.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 87, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 1842, "action_date": "2010-02-11T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 12103, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/12103.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to the 41st legislative day", "journal_page": 362, "committee_id_action": 87, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 6359, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [831, 832, 843, 841, 746, 838, 789], "Nay": [811, 792, 836, 833], "Excused": [828, 793]}}]}
