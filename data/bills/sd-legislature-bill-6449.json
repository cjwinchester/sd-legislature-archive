This exemption does not exempt the operator from first giving notice to the one-call notification center pursuant to \u00a7 49-7A-5 or providing notice of damage pursuant to \u00a7 49-7A-12. Once the emergency response is complete, subsequent excavation involving the facility is subject to the requirements of \u00a7 49-7A-5. 170 copies were printed on recycled paper by the South Dakota Legislative Research Council at a cost of $.098 per page. .

BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. Any requirement to wait a certain time period to excavate does not apply to an excavation deemed necessary to address an emergency condition performed by the operator or an excavator who has been engaged to work on behalf of the operator. In such event, the operator shall give notification in compliance with \u00a7 49-7A-5 prior to the excavation undertaken by the operator to address the emergency condition. Upon being notified that an emergency condition exists, each operator shall provide all available location information to the excavating operator as soon as possible, but the excavating operator need not wait for such location information prior to excavation or continuing excavation. However, every person who engages in any such excavation shall take all necessary and reasonable precautions to avoid or minimize damage to existing underground facilities. In addition, in the event the excavation results in damage to any underground facility, the excavator shall immediately notify the affected operator or the one call notification center of the location and the extent of the damage. Any excavator or operator excavating pursuant to this section who damages or injures the underground facilities of another operator is strictly liable for all damage proximately caused thereby. For purposes of this section, an emergency condition exists when an imminent danger to life, health, property, or public safety exists and there is a substantial likelihood that loss of life, health, or property will result before the procedures set forth in \u00a7\u00a7 49-7A-5 and 49-7A-8 can be fully complied with. Section 2. That \u00a7 49-7A-18 be amended to read as follows: 49-7A-18. Except as provided in \u00a7 49-7A-19 and in addition to all other penalties provided by law, any person who violates or who procures, aids, or abets in the violation of \u00a7 49-7A-2, 49-7A-5, 49-7A-8, or 49-7A-12, section 1 of this Act, or any rules promulgated pursuant to \u00a7 49-7A-2, 49-7A-5, or 49-7A-8 may be assessed a penalty of up to one thousand dollars for the first violation and up to five thousand dollars for each subsequent violation that occurs within twelve months of the initial violation. Section 3. That \u00a7 49-7A-19 be amended to read as follows: 49-7A-19. In addition to all other penalties provided by law, any person who intentionally violates or who intentionally procures, aids, or abets in the violation of \u00a7 49-7A-2, 49-7A-5, 49-7A-8, or 49-7A-12, section 1 of this Act, or any rules promulgated pursuant to \u00a7 49-7A-2, 49-7A-5, or 49-7A-8 may be assessed a penalty of up to five thousand dollars for the first violation and up to ten thousand dollars for each subsequent violation that occurs within twelve months of the initial violation."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 6449, "action_date": "2015-01-16T13:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 33246, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/33246.pdf", "status_text": "First read in Senate and referred to", "journal_page": 54, "committee_id_action": 284, "committee_id_assigned": 261, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 6449, "action_date": "2015-01-29T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 33696, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/33696.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 261, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 6449, "action_date": "2015-01-29T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 34090, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/34090.pdf", "status_text": "Motion to amend", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 261, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 6449, "action_date": "2015-01-29T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 34090, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/34090.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass Amended", "journal_page": 228, "committee_id_action": 261, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 17920, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [853, 894, 895, 890, 889, 943], "Excused": [871]}}, {"bill_id": 6449, "action_date": "2015-02-03T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 34411, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/34411.pdf", "status_text": "Tabled", "journal_page": 269, "committee_id_action": 284, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 18109, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [853, 854, 856, 943, 858, 860, 889, 894, 903, 876, 899, 885, 896, 901, 895, 898, 890, 900, 891, 893, 886, 862, 880, 944, 902, 877, 868, 871, 892, 872, 873, 878, 897], "Excused": [855, 942]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/6449"}
