BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 49-34A-101 be amended to read as follows: 49-34A-101. There is hereby established a state renewable and , recycled , and conserved energy objective that ten percent of all electricity sold at retail within the state by the year 2015 be obtained from renewable energy and , recycled , and conserved energy sources. The In the case of renewable and recycled energy, the objective shall be measured by qualifying megawatt hours delivered at retail or by certificates representing credits purchased and retired to offset nonqualifying retail sales. In the case of conserved energy, the objective shall be measured by methods established by rules promulgated by the commission pursuant to chapter 1-26. This objective is voluntary, and there is no penalty or sanction for a retail provider of electricity that fails to meet this objective. The objective applies to each retail provider of electricity in the state, regardless of the ownership status of the electricity retailer. Any municipal or cooperative utility that receives wholesale electricity through a municipal power agency or generation and transmission cooperative may aggregate its the utility's renewable and , recycled , and conserved energy objective resources to meet this objective. Section 2. That \u00a7 49-34A-102 be amended to read as follows: 49-34A-102. Electricity qualifies for meeting the state renewable and , recycled , and conserved energy objective if the source meets the requirements of \u00a7\u00a7 49-34A-94 to 49-34A-96, inclusive, and the public utilities commission's rules for tracking, recording, and verifying renewable energy certificates. Electricity also qualifies for meeting the state renewable, recycled, and conserved energy objective if the source is conserved energy and meets the requirements established by rules promulgated by the commission pursuant to chapter 1-26. Section 3. That \u00a7 49-34A-103 be amended to read as follows: 49-34A-103. For the purpose of calculating the amount of electricity from a renewable energy and , recycled , and conserved energy source needed to meet the state renewable and recycled energy objective, a retail provider may deduct from its the provider's baseline of total retail sales the proportion of electricity obtained from a hydroelectric facility with an inservice date before July 1, 2008. Section 4. That \u00a7 49-34A-104 be amended to read as follows: 49-34A-104. Before using new renewable and , recycled , and conserved energy after July 1, 2008, to meet the objective, the retail provider or its the provider's generation supplier shall make an evaluation to determine if the use of new renewable and , recycled , and conserved energy is reasonable and cost effective considering other electricity alternatives. After making such an evaluation and considering the state renewable and , recycled , and conserved energy objective, the retail provider or its the provider's generation supplier may use the electricity alternative that best meets its the provider's resource or customer needs. Section 5. That \u00a7 49-34A-105 be amended to read as follows: 49-34A-105. Beginning on December 1, 2008 July 1, 2009 , each retail provider shall annually report to the Public Utilities Commission commission on the provider's energy sales during the twelve month period ending on the preceding September thirtieth December thirty- first . This report shall include information regarding qualifying electricity delivered and renewable energy and recycled energy certificates purchased and retired as a percentage of annual retail sales , the amount of conserved energy as a percentage of annual retail sales, and a brief narrative report that describes steps taken to meet the state renewable and , recycled , and conserved energy objective over time and identifies any challenges or barriers encountered in meeting the objective. The last annual report shall be made on December July 1, 2017. The commission shall make the data and narrative reports available and accessible to the public on the internet. The commission shall compile the data obtained from the reports and submit the data to the Legislature by the following January first. A distribution cooperative may aggregate its the cooperative's reporting through generation and transmission cooperatives and a municipal utility may aggregate its the utility's reporting through a municipal power agency."}, {"bill_id": 766, "bill_version_id": 8835, "bill_version": "Enrolled", "bill_version_date": "2009-03-06T09:17:32.563-06:00", "bill_text": ""}], "amendments": [],
