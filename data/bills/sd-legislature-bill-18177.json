BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 1-16A-71.1 be amended to read as follows: 1-16A-71.1. A physician is eligible to receive tuition reimbursement payments pursuant to the provisions of \u00a7 \u00a7 1-16A-71.1, 1-16A-72.1, and 1-16A-73.1 to 1-16A-73.5, inclusive, if the physician is licensed to practice medicine pursuant to chapter 36-4 and has completed a two-year or three-year accredited residency program in family practice and if the physician agrees to practice as a family physician in an eligible community for a minimum period of three years. However, no more than ten seven physicians may participate in this program at any specified time. Preference shall be given to physicians who have graduated from the University of South Dakota School of Medicine and completed an accredited family practice residency program located in South Dakota. Section 2. That chapter 1-16A be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: A dentist is eligible to receive tuition reimbursement payments pursuant to the provisions of this Act if the dentist is licensed to practice dentistry pursuant to chapter 36-6A and agrees to practice general dentistry in an eligible community for a minimum period of three years. However, no more than three dentists may participate in this program at any specified time. Section 3. That chapter 1-16A be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: For the purposes of this Act, an eligible community is any community in this state that: (1) Has a population of ten thousand persons or less; (2) Agrees to provide its portion of the tuition reimbursement payments payable to a dentist who practices in the community as required by this Act; and (3) Is determined to be eligible by the Department of Health. Before making the determination under subdivision (3) of this section, the Department of Health shall conduct a community assessment designed to evaluate the community's need for a dentist and its ability to sustain and support a dentist. The department shall maintain a list of communities that have been assessed and that are eligible for participation in the tuition reimbursement program established by this Act. The department may revise any community assessment or conduct a new assessment as necessary to reflect any change in conditions within a community. Section 4. That chapter 1-16A be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: A dentist who fulfills the requirements of this Act is entitled to receive tuition reimbursement in an amount equal to twice the University of South Dakota resident tuition that a physician would have paid if the physician had attended the University of South Dakota School of Medicine during the four most recently completed academic years. The amount of reimbursement does not include any interest incurred by a dentist. Section 5. That chapter 1-16A be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Any agreement for the payment of tuition reimbursement pursuant to this Act obligates the community to be served by a dentist to provide a portion of the total amount of tuition reimbursement, based on the following criteria: (1) Communities of two thousand five hundred persons or less shall provide twenty-five percent of tuition reimbursement payments; (2) Communities of more than two thousand five hundred persons and less than five thousand persons shall provide fifty percent of tuition reimbursement payments; and (3) All remaining eligible communities shall provide seventy-five percent of tuition reimbursement payments. When the community certifies to the secretary of health that it has paid the full amount for which it is obligated, the secretary of the Department of Health shall pay to the dentist the remaining balance of the total tuition reimbursement amount. The secretary shall pay the required amount out of funds appropriated by the Legislature for such purpose. Reimbursement shall be paid upon the dentist's completion of the required three-year practice period. However, a community may pay its share of tuition reimbursement in installments during the required three-year period. Section 6. That chapter 1-16A be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Any eligible municipality may appropriate funds for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this Act. Section 7. That chapter 1-16A be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: No tuition reimbursement agreement entered into pursuant to the provisions of this Act is effective until it is filed with and approved by the secretary of health. The secretary may prescribe, by rules promulgated pursuant to chapter 1-26, the form of agreements and procedure for approval. Section 8. That chapter 1-16A be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: No person may participate in the tuition reimbursement program established by this Act if the person has previously participated in the program, or any other state or federal scholarship, loan repayment, or tuition reimbursement program which obligates the person to provide dental services within an underserved area. Section 9. That chapter 1-16A be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Any person participating in the tuition reimbursement program established by this Act shall agree to be a participating South Dakota medical assistance provider and to serve any individual eligible under chapter 28-6 and may not refuse treatment to any such individual while participating in the tuition reimbursement program."}, {"bill_id": 18177, "bill_version_id": 96917, "bill_version": "Enrolled", "bill_version_date": "2003-02-11T08:24:59-06:00", "bill_text": ""}], "amendments": [],
