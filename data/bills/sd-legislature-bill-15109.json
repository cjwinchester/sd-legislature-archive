Divide the amount of the household's discretionary income in half. The result added to the household's adjusted resources determined according to \u00a7 28-13-32.8 equals the household's discretionary income that was available to purchase health insurance; (5) Subtract the amount of the monthly health insurance premium that was available to the household if known or, if unknown, an estimate of the premium the household could be expected to incur. For purposes of this subdivision, the county shall establish such estimate either by obtaining premium estimates from two major medical insurance carriers doing business in the state or by using an estimate based on the rate data provided to the county by the Division of Insurance of the Department of Commerce and Regulation. The policy used shall have a benefit design that equals or exceeds the benefit design of the basic benefit plan as developed by the Health Benefit Plan Committee pursuant to \u00a7 58-18B-32.
