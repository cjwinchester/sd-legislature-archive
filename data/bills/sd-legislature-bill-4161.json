If a policy's or contract's interest or changes in value are credited less frequently than annually, then for purposes of determining the values that have been credited and are not subject to forfeiture under this subsection, the interest or change in value determined by using the procedures defined in the policy or contract will be credited as if the contractual date of crediting interest or changing values was the date of impairment or insolvency, whichever is earlier, and will not be subject to forfeiture; and (l) A policy or contract providing any hospital, medical, prescription drug, or other health care benefits pursuant to Part C or Part D of Subchapter XVIII Chapter 7 of Title 42 of the United States Code (commonly known as Medicare Part C & D) or any regulations issued pursuant thereto.

(1) A person receiving benefits under this chapter shall be deemed to have assigned the rights under, and any causes of action against any person for losses arising under, resulting from, or otherwise relating to, the covered policy or contract to the association to the extent of the benefits received because of this chapter, whether the benefits are payments of or on account of contractual obligations, continuation of coverage, or provision of substitute or alternative coverages. The association may require an assignment to it of such rights and cause of action by any payee, policy, or contract owner, beneficiary, insured, or annuitant as a condition precedent to the receipt of any right or benefits conferred by this chapter upon the person. (2) The subrogation rights of the association under this subpart shall have the same priority against the assets of the impaired or insolvent insurer as that possessed by the person entitled to receive benefits under this chapter. (3) In addition to subdivisions (1) and (2) of this subpart, the association shall have all common law rights of subrogation and any other equitable or legal remedy that would have been available to the impaired or insolvent insurer or owner, beneficiary, or payee of a policy or contract with respect to the policy or contracts (including, in the case of a structured settlement annuity, any rights of the owner, beneficiary, or payee of the annuity, to the extent of benefits received pursuant to this chapter, against a person originally or by succession responsible for the losses arising from the personal injury relating to the annuity or payment therefor, excepting any such person responsible solely by reason of serving as an assignee in respect of a qualified assignment under Internal Revenue Code \u00a7 130). (4) If the preceding provisions of this subpart are invalid or ineffective with respect to any person or claim for any reason, the amount payable by the association with respect to the related covered obligations shall be reduced by the amount realized by any other person with respect to the person or claim that is attributable to the policies (or portion thereof) covered by the association. (5) If the association has provided benefits with respect to a covered obligation and a person recovers amounts as to which the association has rights as described in the preceding subdivisions of this subpart, the person shall pay to the association the portion of the recovery attributable to the policies (or portion thereof) covered by the association. L. In addition to the rights and powers elsewhere in this chapter, the association may: (1) Enter into such contracts as are necessary or proper to carry out the provisions and purposes of this chapter; (2) Sue or be sued, including taking any legal actions necessary or proper to recover any unpaid assessments under \u00a7 58-29C-52 and to settle claims or potential claims against it; (3) Borrow money to effect the purposes of this chapter; any notes or other evidence of indebtedness of the association not in default shall be legal investments for domestic insurers and may be carried as admitted assets; (4) Employ or retain such persons as are necessary or appropriate to handle the financial transactions of the association, and to perform such other functions as become necessary or proper under this chapter; (5) Take such legal action as may be necessary or appropriate to avoid or recover payment of improper claims; (6) Exercise, for the purposes of this chapter and to the extent approved by the director, the powers of a domestic life or health insurer, but in no case may the association issue insurance policies or annuity contracts other than those issued to perform its obligations under this chapter; (7) Organize itself as a corporation or in other legal form permitted by the laws of the state; (8) Request information from a person seeking coverage from the association in order to aid the association in determining its obligations under this chapter with respect to the person, and the person shall promptly comply with the request; and (9) Take other necessary or appropriate action to discharge its duties and obligations under this chapter or to exercise its powers under this chapter. M. The association may join an organization of one or more other state associations of similar purposes, to further the purposes and administer the powers and duties of the association. N. (1)(a) At any time within one year after the date on which the association becomes responsible for the obligations of a member insurer (the coverage date) one hundred eighty days of the date of the order of liquidation, the association may elect to succeed to the rights and obligations of the member insurer, that accrue on or after the coverage date and ceding member insurer that relate to contracts policies or annuities covered (, in whole or in part), by the association, in each case under any one or more indemnity reinsurance agreements contracts entered into by the member insolvent insurer as a ceding insurer and its reinsurers and selected by the association. However, the association may not exercise an election with respect to a reinsurance agreement if the receiver, rehabilitator, or liquidator of the member insurer has previously and expressly disaffirmed the reinsurance agreement. Any such assumption shall be effective as of the date of the order of liquidation. The election shall be effected by a notice to the receiver, rehabilitator, or liquidator and the association or the National Organization of Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Associations (NOLHGA) on its behalf sending written notice, return receipt requested, to the affected reinsurers. If the association makes an election, subsections (a) to (d), inclusive, of this subdivision shall apply with respect to the agreements selected by the association: (b) To facilitate the earliest practicable decision about whether to assume any of the contracts of reinsurance, and in order to protect the financial position of the estate, the receiver and each reinsurer of the ceding member insurer shall make available upon request to the association or to NOLHGA on its behalf as soon as possible after commencement of formal delinquency proceedings: (i) Copies of in-force contracts of reinsurance and all related files and records relevant to the determination of whether such contracts should be assumed; and (ii) Notices of any defaults under the reinsurance contracts or any known event or condition which with the passage of time could become a default under the reinsurance contracts. (c) Subparagraphs (i) to (iv) apply to reinsurance contracts so assumed by the association: (a)(i) The association shall be responsible for all unpaid premiums due under the agreements ( reinsurance contracts for periods both before and after the coverage date) of the order of liquidation, and shall be responsible for the performance of all other obligations to be performed after the coverage date of the order of liquidation, in each case which relate to contracts policies or annuities covered (, in whole or in part), by the association. The association may charge contracts policies or annuities covered in part by the association, through reasonable allocation methods, the costs for reinsurance in excess of the obligations of the association and shall provide notice and an accounting of these charges to the liquidator; (b)(ii) The association is entitled to any amounts payable by the reinsurer under the agreements reinsurance contracts with respect to losses or events that occur in periods after the coverage date of the order of liquidation and that relate to contracts policies or annuities covered by the association (, in whole or in part). However, by the association, provided that, upon receipt of any such amounts, the association is obliged to pay to the beneficiary under the policy or contract annuity on account of which the amounts were paid a portion of the amount equal to the lesser of: (A) The amount received by the association; and (B) The excess of: (i) The the amount received by the association, over (ii) The the amount equal to the benefits paid by the association on account of the policy or contract annuity less the retention of the impaired or insolvent member insurer applicable to the loss or event;. (c)(iii) Within thirty days following the association's election (the \"election date\"), the association and each indemnity reinsurer under contracts assumed by the association shall calculate the net balance due to or from the association under each reinsurance agreement contract as of the date of election date with respect to policies or annuities covered, in whole or in part, by the association's election, giving association, which calculation shall give full credit to all items paid by either the member insurer (or its receiver, rehabilitator, or liquidator) or the indemnity reinsurer during the period between the coverage date and the date of the association's election. Either the association or indemnity reinsurer shall pay the net balance due the other or its receiver or the reinsurer prior to the election date. The reinsurer shall pay the receiver any amounts due for losses or events prior to the date of the order of liquidation, subject to any set-off for premiums unpaid for periods prior to the date, and the association or reinsurer shall pay any remaining balance due the other, in each case within five days of the completion of the aforementioned calculation. Any disputes over the amounts due to either the association or the reinsurer shall be resolved by arbitration pursuant to the terms of the affected reinsurance contracts or, if the contract contains no arbitration clause, as otherwise provided by law. If the receiver, rehabilitator, or liquidator has received any amounts due the association pursuant to subsection (b) subsection (1)(c)(ii), the receiver, rehabilitator, or liquidator shall remit the same to the association as promptly as practicable. (d)(iv) If the association or receiver, on the association's behalf, within sixty days of the election date, pays the unpaid premiums due for periods both before and after the coverage election date that relate to contracts policies or annuities covered by the association (, in whole or in part) by the association, the reinsurer is not entitled to terminate the reinsurance agreements contracts for failure to pay premium insofar as the agreements reinsurance contracts relate to contracts covered by the association ( policies or annuities covered, in whole or in part), by the association, and is not entitled to set off any unpaid premium due for periods prior to the coverage date amounts due under other contracts, or unpaid amounts due from parties other than the association, against amounts due the association. (2) If the association transfers its obligations to another insurer, and if the association and the other insurer agree, the other insurer shall succeed to the rights and obligations of the association under subdivision (1) effective as of the date agreed upon by the association and the other insurer and regardless of whether the association has made the election referred to above in subdivision (1) provided that: (a) The indemnity reinsurance agreements shall automatically terminate for new reinsurance unless the indemnity reinsurer and the other insurer agree to the contrary; During the period from the date of the order of liquidation until the election date (or, if the election date does not occur, until one hundred eighty days after the date of the order of liquidation); (a)(i) Neither the association nor the reinsurer shall have any rights or obligations under reinsurance contracts that the association has the right to assume under subsection (1), whether for periods prior to or after the date of the order of liquidation; and (ii) The reinsurer, the receiver, and the association shall, to the extent practicable, provide each other data and records reasonably requested; (b) Provided that once the association has elected to assume a reinsurance contract, the parties' rights and obligations shall be governed by subsection (1). (3) If the association does not elect to assume a reinsurance contract by the election date pursuant to subsection (1), the association shall have no rights or obligations, in each case for periods both before and after the date of the order of liquidation, with respect to the reinsurance contract. (4) When policies or annuities, or covered obligations with respect thereto, are transferred to an assuming insurer, reinsurance on the policies or annuities may also be transferred by the association, in the case of contracts assumed under subsection (1), subject to the following: (a) Unless the reinsurer and the assuming insurer agree otherwise, the reinsurance contract transferred may not cover any new policies of insurance or annuities in addition to those transferred; (b) The obligations described in the proviso to subsection (1)(b) of this subpart section no longer apply on and after the date the indemnity reinsurance agreement is transferred to the third party insurer with respect to matters arising after the effective date of the transfer; and (c) This subdivision (2) does not apply if the association has previously expressly determined in writing that it will not exercise the election referred to in subdivision (1) The transferring party shall give notice in writing, return receipt requested, to the affected reinsurer not less than thirty days prior to the effective date of the transfer; (3)(5) The provisions of this subpart subsection N shall supersede the provisions of any law of this state law or of any affected reinsurance agreement contract that provides for or requires any payment of reinsurance proceeds, on account of losses or events that occur in periods after the coverage date of the order of liquidation, to the receiver, liquidator, or rehabilitator of the insolvent member insurer or any other person. The receiver, rehabilitator, or liquidator shall remain entitled to any amounts payable by the reinsurer under the reinsurance agreement contracts with respect to losses or events that occur in periods prior to the coverage date ( of the order of liquidation, subject to applicable setoff provisions); and (4)(6) Except as otherwise expressly provided above in this section, nothing herein in subsection N alters or modifies the terms and conditions of the indemnity any reinsurance agreements of the insolvent member insurer contract. Nothing herein in this section abrogates or limits any rights of any reinsurer to claim that it is entitled to rescind a reinsurance agreement contract. Nothing herein in this section gives a policy owner or beneficiary an independent cause of action against an indemnity a reinsurer that is not otherwise set forth in the indemnity reinsurance agreement reinsurance contract. No provision in this section limits or affects the association's rights as a creditor of the estate against the assets of the estate. No provision in this section applies to reinsurance agreements covering property or casualty risks. O. The board of directors of the association shall have discretion and may exercise reasonable business judgment to determine the means by which the association is to provide the benefits of this chapter in an economical and efficient manner. P. Where the association has arranged or offered to provide the benefits of this chapter to a covered person under a plan or arrangement that fulfills the association's obligations under this chapter, the person is not entitled to benefits from the association in addition to or other than those provided under the plan or arrangement. Q. Venue in a suit against the association arising under the chapter shall be in Hughes County. The association may not be required to give an appeal bond in an appeal that relates to a cause of action arising under this chapter. R. In carrying out its duties in connection with guaranteeing, assuming, or reinsuring policies or contracts under subpart A or B, the association may, subject to approval of the receivership court, issue substitute coverage for a policy or contract that provides an interest rate, crediting rate, or similar factor determined by use of an index or other external reference stated in the policy or contract employed in calculating returns or changes in value by issuing an alternative policy or contract in accordance with the following provisions: (1) In lieu of the index or other external reference provided for in the original policy or contract, the alternative policy or contract provides for (i) a fixed interest rate or (ii) payment of dividends with minimum guarantees or (iii) different methods for calculating interest or changes in value; (2) There is no requirement for evidence of insurability, waiting period, or other exclusion that would not have applied under the replaced policy or contract; and (3) The alternative policy or contract is substantially similar to the replaced policy or contract in all other material terms. Section 5. That \u00a7 58-29C-52 be amended to read as follows: 58-29C-52. A. For the purpose of providing the funds necessary to carry out the powers and duties of the association, the board of directors shall assess the member insurers, separately for each account, at such time and for such amounts as the board finds necessary. Assessments shall be due not less than thirty days after prior written notice to the member insurers and shall accrue interest at ten percent per annum on and after the due date. B. There shall be two classes of assessments, as follows: (1) Class A assessments shall be authorized and called for the purpose of meeting administrative and legal costs and other expenses. Class A assessments may be authorized and called whether or not related to a particular impaired or insolvent insurer. (2) Class B assessments shall be authorized and called to the extent necessary to carry out the powers and duties of the association under \u00a7 58-29C-51 with regard to an impaired or an insolvent insurer. C. (1) The amount of a Class A assessment shall be determined by the board and may be authorized and called on a pro rata or nonpro rata basis. If pro rata, the board may provide that it be credited against future Class B assessments. The total of all nonpro rata assessments may not exceed one hundred fifty three hundred dollars per member insurer in any one calendar year. The amount of a Class B assessment shall be allocated for assessment purposes among the accounts pursuant to an allocation formula which may be based on the premiums or reserves of the impaired or insolvent insurer or any other standard deemed by the board in its sole discretion as being fair and reasonable under the circumstances. (2) Class B assessments against member insurers for each account and subaccount shall be in the proportion that the premiums received on business in this state by each assessed member insurer on policies or contracts covered by each account for the three most recent calendar years for which information is available preceding the year in which the insurer became insolvent (or, in the case of an assessment with respect to an impaired insurer, the three most recent calendar years for which information is available preceding the year in which the insurer became impaired) bears to premiums received on business in this state for those calendar years by all assessed member insurers. (3) Assessments for funds to meet the requirements of the association with respect to an impaired or insolvent insurer may not be authorized or called until necessary to implement the purposes of this chapter. Classification of assessments under subpart B and computation of assessments under this subpart shall be made with a reasonable degree of accurate accuracy, recognizing that exact determinations may not always be possible. The association shall notify each member insurer of its anticipated pro rata share of an authorized assessment not yet called within one hundred eighty days after the assessment is authorized. D. The association may abate or defer, in whole or in part, the assessment of a member insurer if, in the opinion of the board, payment of the assessment would endanger the ability of the member insurer to fulfill its contractual obligations. In the event an assessment against a member insurer is abated, or deferred in whole or in part, the amount by which the assessment is abated or deferred may be assessed against the other member insurers in a manner consistent with the basis for assessments set forth in this section. Once the conditions that caused a deferral have been removed or rectified, the member insurer shall pay all assessments that were deferred pursuant to a repayment plan approved by the association. E. (1)(a) Subject to the provisions of subsection (b) of this subdivision, the total of all assessments authorized by the association with respect to a member insurer for each subaccount of the life insurance and annuity account and for the health account may not in one calendar year exceed two percent of that member insurer's average annual premiums received in this state on the policies and contracts covered by the subaccount or account during the three calendar years preceding the year in which the insurer became an impaired or insolvent insurer. (b) If two or more assessments are authorized in one calendar year with respect to insurers that become impaired or insolvent in different calendar years, the average annual premiums for purposes of the aggregate assessment percentage limitation referenced in subsection (a) of this subdivision shall be equal and limited to the higher of the three-year average annual premiums for the applicable subaccount or account as calculated pursuant to this section. (c) If the maximum assessment, together with the other assets of the association in an account, does not provide in one year in either account an amount sufficient to carry out the responsibilities of the association, the necessary additional funds shall be assessed as soon thereafter as permitted by this chapter. (2) The board may provide in the plan of operation a method of allocating funds among claims, whether relating to one or more impaired or insolvent insurers, when the maximum assessment will be insufficient to cover anticipated claims. (3) If the maximum assessment for a subaccount of the life and annuity account in one year does not provide an amount sufficient to carry out the responsibilities of the association, then pursuant to subdivision C(2), the board shall access the other subaccounts of the life and annuity account for the necessary additional amount, subject to the maximum stated in subdivision (1) of this section. F. The board may, by an equitable method as established in the plan of operation, refund to member insurers, in proportion to the contribution of each insurer to that account, the amount by which the assets of the account exceed the amount the board finds is necessary to carry out during the coming year the obligations of the association with regard to that account, including assets accruing from assignment, subrogation, net realized gains, and income from investments. A reasonable amount may be retained in any account to provide funds for the continuing expenses of the association and for future losses claims. G. It shall be proper for any member insurer, in determining its premium rates and policy owner dividends as to any kind of insurance within the scope of this chapter, to consider the amount reasonably necessary to meet its assessment obligations under this chapter. H. The association shall issue to each insurer paying an assessment under this chapter, other than a Class A assessment, a certificate of contribution, in a form prescribed by the director, for the amount of the assessment so paid. All outstanding certificates shall be of equal dignity and priority without reference to amounts or dates of issue. A certificate of contribution may be shown by the insurer in its financial statement as an asset in such form and for such amount, if any, and period of time as the director may approve. I. (1) A member insurer that wishes to protest all or part of an assessment shall pay when due the full amount of the assessment as set forth in the notice provided by the association. The payment shall be available to meet association obligations during the pendency of the protest or any subsequent appeal. Payment shall be accompanied by a statement in writing that the payment is made under protest and setting forth a brief statement of the grounds for the protest. (2) Within sixty days following the payment of an assessment under protest by a member insurer, the association shall notify the member insurer in writing of its determination with respect to the protest unless the association notifies the member insurer that additional time is required to resolve the issues raised by the protest. (3) Within thirty days after a final decision has been made, the association shall notify the protesting member insurer in writing of that final decision. Within sixty days of receipt of notice of the final decision, the protesting member insurer may appeal that final action to the director. (4) In the alternative to rendering a final decision with respect to a protest based on a question regarding the assessment base, the association may refer protests to the director for a final decision, with or without a recommendation from the association. (5) If the protest or appeal on the assessment is upheld, the amount paid in error or excess shall be returned to the member company. Interest on a refund due a protesting member shall be paid at the rate actually earned by the association. J. The association may request information of member insurers in order to aid in the exercise of its power under this section and member insurers shall promptly comply with a request. Section 6. That \u00a7 58-29C-53 be amended to read as follows: 58-29C-53. A. (1) The association shall submit to the director a plan of operation and any amendments thereto necessary or suitable to assure the fair, reasonable, and equitable administration of the association. The plan of operation and any amendments thereto shall become effective upon the director's written approval or unless it has not been disapproved within thirty days. (2) If the association fails to submit a suitable plan of operation within one hundred twenty days following July 1, 2003, or if at any time thereafter the association fails to submit suitable amendments to the plan, the director shall, after notice and hearing, adopt and promulgate such reasonable rules as are necessary or advisable to effectuate the provisions of this chapter. The rules shall continue in force until modified by the director or superseded by a plan submitted by the association and approved by the director. B. All member insurers shall comply with the plan of operation. C. The plan of operation shall, in addition to requirements enumerated elsewhere in this chapter: (1) Establish procedures for handling the assets of the association; (2) Establish the amount and method of reimbursing members of the board of directors under \u00a7 58-29C-50; (3) Establish regular places and times for meetings including telephone conference calls of the board of directors; (4) Establish procedures for records to be kept of all financial transactions of the association, its agents, and the board of directors; (5) Establish the procedures whereby selections for the board of directors will be made and submitted to the director; (6) Establish any additional procedures for assessments under \u00a7 58-29C-52; (7) Contain additional provisions necessary or proper for the execution of the powers and duties of the association; (8) Establish procedures whereby a director may be removed for cause, including in the case where a member insurer director becomes an impaired or insolvent insurer; (9) Require the board of directors to establish a policy and procedures for addressing conflicts of interests. D. The plan of operation may provide that any or all powers and duties of the association, except those under subdivision 58-29C-51L(3) and \u00a7 58-29C-52, are delegated to a corporation, association, or other organization which performs or will perform functions similar to those of this association, or its equivalent, in two or more states. Such a corporation, association, or organization shall be reimbursed for any payments made on behalf of the association and shall be paid for its performance of any function of the association. A delegation under this subpart shall take effect only with the approval of both the board of directors and the director, and may be made only to a corporation, association, or organization which extends protection not substantially less favorable and effective than that provided by this chapter. Section 7. That \u00a7 58-29C-54 be amended to read as follows: 58-29C-54. In addition to the duties and powers enumerated elsewhere in this chapter, A. The director shall: (1) Upon request of the board of directors, provide the association with a statement of the premiums in this and any other appropriate states for each member insurer; (2) When an impairment is declared and the amount of the impairment is determined, serve a demand upon the impaired insurer to make good the impairment within a reasonable time; notice to the impaired insurer shall constitute notice to its shareholders, if any; the failure of the insurer to promptly comply with such demand shall not excuse the association from the performance of its powers and duties under this chapter; (3) In any liquidation or rehabilitation proceeding involving a domestic insurer, be appointed as the liquidator or rehabilitator. B. The director may suspend or revoke, after notice and hearing, the certificate of authority to transact insurance in this state of any member insurer which fails to pay an assessment when due or fails to comply with the plan of operation. As an alternative the director may levy a forfeiture on any member insurer that fails to pay an assessment when due. The forfeiture may not exceed five percent of the unpaid assessment per month, but no forfeiture shall be less than one hundred dollars per month. C. A final action of the board of directors or the association may be appealed to the director by a member insurer if the appeal is taken within sixty days of its receipt of notice of the final action being appealed. A final action or order of the director shall be subject to judicial review in a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with the laws of this state that apply to the actions or orders of the director. D. The liquidator, rehabilitator, or conservator of an impaired or insolvent insurer may notify all interested persons of the effect of this chapter. Section 8. That \u00a7 58-29C-57 be amended to read as follows: 58-29C-57. A. This chapter may not be construed to reduce the liability for unpaid assessments of the insureds of an impaired or insolvent insurer operating under a plan with assessment liability. B. Records shall be kept of all meetings of the board of directors to discuss the activities of the association in carrying out its powers and duties under \u00a7 58-29C-51. The records of the association with respect to an impaired or insolvent insurer may only not be disclosed upon prior to the termination of a liquidation, rehabilitation, or conservation proceeding involving the impaired or insolvent insurer, except (i) upon the termination of the impairment or insolvency of the insurer, or (ii) upon the order of a court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this subpart shall limit the duty of the association to render a report of its activities under \u00a7 58-29C-58. C. For the purpose of carrying out its obligations under this chapter, the association shall be deemed to be a creditor of the impaired or insolvent insurer to the extent of assets attributable to covered policies reduced by any amounts to which the association is entitled as subrogee pursuant to subpart \u00a7 58-29C-51K. Assets of the impaired or insolvent insurer attributable to covered policies shall be used to continue all covered policies and pay all contractual obligations of the impaired or insolvent insurer as required by this chapter. Assets attributable to covered policies, as used in this subpart, are that proportion of the assets which the reserves that should have been established for such policies bear to the reserves that should have been established for all policies of insurance written by the impaired or insolvent insurer. D. As a creditor of the impaired or insolvent insurer as established in subpart C of this section and consistent with \u00a7 58-29B-98, the association and other similar associations shall be entitled to receive a disbursement of assets out of the marshaled assets, from time to time as the assets become available to reimburse it, as a credit against contractual obligations under this chapter. If the liquidator has not, within one hundred twenty days of a final determination of insolvency of an insurer by the receivership court, made an application to the court for the approval of a proposal to disburse assets out of marshaled assets to guaranty associations having obligations because of the insolvency, then the association shall be entitled to make application to the receivership court for approval of its own proposal to disburse these assets. E. (1) Prior to the termination of any liquidation, rehabilitation, or conservation proceeding, the court may take into consideration the contributions of the respective parties, including the association, the shareholders, and policy owners of the insolvent insurer, and any other party with a bona fide interest, in making an equitable distribution of the ownership rights of the insolvent insurer. In such a determination, consideration shall be given to the welfare of the policy owners of the continuing or successor insurer. (2) No distribution to stockholders, if any, of an impaired or insolvent insurer shall be made until and unless the total amount of valid claims of the association with interest thereon for funds expended in carrying out its powers and duties under 58-29C-51 with respect to the insurer have been fully recovered by the association. F. (1) If an order for liquidation or rehabilitation of an insurer domiciled in this state has been entered, the receiver appointed under the order may has a right to recover on behalf of the insurer, from any affiliate that controlled it, the amount of distributions, other than stock dividends paid by the insurer on its capital stock, made at any time during the five years preceding the petition for liquidation or rehabilitation subject to the limitations of subdivisions (2) to (4), inclusive. (2) No such distribution is recoverable if the insurer shows that when paid the distribution was lawful and reasonable, and that the insurer did not know and could not reasonably have known that the distribution might adversely affect the ability of the insurer to fulfill its contractual obligations. (3) Any person who was an affiliate that controlled the insurer at the time the distributions were paid is liable up to the amount of distributions received. Any person who was an affiliate that controlled the insurer at the time the distributions were declared, shall be liable up to the amount of distributions which would have been received if they had been paid immediately. If two or more persons are liable with respect to the same distributions, they shall be jointly and severally liable. (4) The maximum amount recoverable under this subpart shall be the amount needed in excess of all other available assets of the insolvent insurer to pay the contractual obligations of the insolvent insurer. (5) If any person liable under subdivision (3) is insolvent, all its affiliates that controlled it at the time the distribution was paid, shall be jointly and severally liable for any resulting deficiency in the amount recovered from the insolvent affiliate. Section 9. That \u00a7 58-29C-60 be amended to read as follows: 58-29C-60. There is no liability on the part of and no cause of action of any nature may arise against any member insurer or its agents or employees, the association or its agents or employees, members of the board of directors, or the director or the director's representatives, for any action or omission by them in the performance of their powers and duties under this chapter. Immunity This immunity shall extend to the participation in any organization of one or more other state associations of similar purposes and to any such organization and its agents or employees. Section 10. That \u00a7 58-29C-61 be amended to read as follows: 58-29C-61. All proceedings in which the insolvent insurer is a party in any court in this state shall be stayed sixty one hundred eighty days from the date an order of liquidation, rehabilitation, or conservation is final to permit proper legal action by the association on any matters germane to its powers or duties. As to judgment under any decision, order, verdict, or finding based on default the association may apply to have such judgment set aside by the same court that made such judgment and shall be permitted to defend against such suit on the merits. Section 11. That \u00a7 58-29C-62 be amended to read as follows: 58-29C-62. A. No person, including an insurer, agent, or affiliate of an insurer may make, publish, disseminate, circulate, or place before the public, or cause directly or indirectly, to be made, published, disseminated, circulated, or placed before the public, in any newspaper, magazine, or other publication, or in the form of a notice, circulate circular, pamphlet, letter, or poster, or over any radio station or television station, or in any other way, any advertisement, announcement, or statement, written or oral, which uses the existence of the Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Association of this state for the purpose of sales, solicitation, or inducement to purchase any form of insurance covered by the South Dakota Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Association chapter. However, this section does not apply to the South Dakota Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Association or any other entity which does not sell or solicit insurance. B. Within one hundred eighty days of July 1, 2003, the association shall prepare a summary document describing the general purposes and current limitations of the chapter and complying with subpart C of this section. This document shall be submitted to the director for approval. At the expiration of the sixtieth day after the date on which the director approves the document, an insurer may not deliver a policy or contract to a policy or contract owner unless the summary document is delivered to the policy or contract owner at the time of delivery of the policy or contract. The document shall also be available upon request by a policy owner. The distribution, delivery, or contents or interpretation of this document does not guarantee that either the policy or the contract or the owner of the policy or contract is covered in the event of the impairment or insolvency of a member insurer. The description document shall be revised by the association as amendments to the chapter may require.

In addition to the rights and powers elsewhere in this chapter, the association may: (1) Enter into such contracts as are necessary or proper to carry out the provisions and purposes of this chapter; (2) Sue or be sued, including taking any legal actions necessary or proper to recover any unpaid assessments under \u00a7 58-29C-52 and to settle claims or potential claims against it; (3) Borrow money to effect the purposes of this chapter; any notes or other evidence of indebtedness of the association not in default shall be legal investments for domestic insurers and may be carried as admitted assets; (4) Employ or retain such persons as are necessary or appropriate to handle the financial transactions of the association, and to perform such other functions as become necessary or proper under this chapter; (5) Take such legal action as may be necessary or appropriate to avoid or recover payment of improper claims; (6) Exercise, for the purposes of this chapter and to the extent approved by the director, the powers of a domestic life or health insurer, but in no case may the association issue insurance policies or annuity contracts other than those issued to perform its obligations under this chapter; (7) Organize itself as a corporation or in other legal form permitted by the laws of the state; (8) Request information from a person seeking coverage from the association in order to aid the association in determining its obligations under this chapter with respect to the person, and the person shall promptly comply with the request; and (9) Take other necessary or appropriate action to discharge its duties and obligations under this chapter or to exercise its powers under this chapter. M. The association may join an organization of one or more other state associations of similar purposes, to further the purposes and administer the powers and duties of the association. N. (1)(a) At any time within one year after the date on which the association becomes responsible for the obligations of a member insurer (the coverage date) one hundred eighty days of the date of the order of liquidation, the association may elect to succeed to the rights and obligations of the member insurer, that accrue on or after the coverage date and ceding member insurer that relate to contracts policies or annuities covered (, in whole or in part), by the association, in each case under any one or more indemnity reinsurance agreements contracts entered into by the member insolvent insurer as a ceding insurer and its reinsurers and selected by the association. However, the association may not exercise an election with respect to a reinsurance agreement if the receiver, rehabilitator, or liquidator of the member insurer has previously and expressly disaffirmed the reinsurance agreement. Any such assumption shall be effective as of the date of the order of liquidation. The election shall be effected by a notice to the receiver, rehabilitator, or liquidator and the association or the National Organization of Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Associations (NOLHGA) on its behalf sending written notice, return receipt requested, to the affected reinsurers. If the association makes an election, subsections (a) to (d), inclusive, of this subdivision shall apply with respect to the agreements selected by the association: (b) To facilitate the earliest practicable decision about whether to assume any of the contracts of reinsurance, and in order to protect the financial position of the estate, the receiver and each reinsurer of the ceding member insurer shall make available upon request to the association or to NOLHGA on its behalf as soon as possible after commencement of formal delinquency proceedings: (i) Copies of in-force contracts of reinsurance and all related files and records relevant to the determination of whether such contracts should be assumed; and (ii) Notices of any defaults under the reinsurance contracts or any known event or condition which with the passage of time could become a default under the reinsurance contracts. (c) Subparagraphs (i) to (iv) apply to reinsurance contracts so assumed by the association: (a)(i) The association shall be responsible for all unpaid premiums due under the agreements ( reinsurance contracts for periods both before and after the coverage date) of the order of liquidation, and shall be responsible for the performance of all other obligations to be performed after the coverage date of the order of liquidation, in each case which relate to contracts policies or annuities covered (, in whole or in part), by the association. The association may charge contracts policies or annuities covered in part by the association, through reasonable allocation methods, the costs for reinsurance in excess of the obligations of the association and shall provide notice and an accounting of these charges to the liquidator; (b)(ii) The association is entitled to any amounts payable by the reinsurer under the agreements reinsurance contracts with respect to losses or events that occur in periods after the coverage date of the order of liquidation and that relate to contracts policies or annuities covered by the association (, in whole or in part). However, by the association, provided that, upon receipt of any such amounts, the association is obliged to pay to the beneficiary under the policy or contract annuity on account of which the amounts were paid a portion of the amount equal to the lesser of: (A) The amount received by the association; and (B) The excess of: (i) The the amount received by the association, over (ii) The the amount equal to the benefits paid by the association on account of the policy or contract annuity less the retention of the impaired or insolvent member insurer applicable to the loss or event;. (c)(iii) Within thirty days following the association's election (the \"election date\"), the association and each indemnity reinsurer under contracts assumed by the association shall calculate the net balance due to or from the association under each reinsurance agreement contract as of the date of election date with respect to policies or annuities covered, in whole or in part, by the association's election, giving association, which calculation shall give full credit to all items paid by either the member insurer (or its receiver, rehabilitator, or liquidator) or the indemnity reinsurer during the period between the coverage date and the date of the association's election. Either the association or indemnity reinsurer shall pay the net balance due the other or its receiver or the reinsurer prior to the election date. The reinsurer shall pay the receiver any amounts due for losses or events prior to the date of the order of liquidation, subject to any set-off for premiums unpaid for periods prior to the date, and the association or reinsurer shall pay any remaining balance due the other, in each case within five days of the completion of the aforementioned calculation. Any disputes over the amounts due to either the association or the reinsurer shall be resolved by arbitration pursuant to the terms of the affected reinsurance contracts or, if the contract contains no arbitration clause, as otherwise provided by law. If the receiver, rehabilitator, or liquidator has received any amounts due the association pursuant to subsection (b) subsection (1)(c)(ii), the receiver, rehabilitator, or liquidator shall remit the same to the association as promptly as practicable. (d)(iv) If the association or receiver, on the association's behalf, within sixty days of the election date, pays the unpaid premiums due for periods both before and after the coverage election date that relate to contracts policies or annuities covered by the association (, in whole or in part) by the association, the reinsurer is not entitled to terminate the reinsurance agreements contracts for failure to pay premium insofar as the agreements reinsurance contracts relate to contracts covered by the association ( policies or annuities covered, in whole or in part), by the association, and is not entitled to set off any unpaid premium due for periods prior to the coverage date amounts due under other contracts, or unpaid amounts due from parties other than the association, against amounts due the association. (2) If the association transfers its obligations to another insurer, and if the association and the other insurer agree, the other insurer shall succeed to the rights and obligations of the association under subdivision (1) effective as of the date agreed upon by the association and the other insurer and regardless of whether the association has made the election referred to above in subdivision (1) provided that: (a) The indemnity reinsurance agreements shall automatically terminate for new reinsurance unless the indemnity reinsurer and the other insurer agree to the contrary; During the period from the date of the order of liquidation until the election date (or, if the election date does not occur, until one hundred eighty days after the date of the order of liquidation); (a)(i) Neither the association nor the reinsurer shall have any rights or obligations under reinsurance contracts that the association has the right to assume under subsection (1), whether for periods prior to or after the date of the order of liquidation; and (ii) The reinsurer, the receiver, and the association shall, to the extent practicable, provide each other data and records reasonably requested; (b) Provided that once the association has elected to assume a reinsurance contract, the parties' rights and obligations shall be governed by subsection (1). (3) If the association does not elect to assume a reinsurance contract by the election date pursuant to subsection (1), the association shall have no rights or obligations, in each case for periods both before and after the date of the order of liquidation, with respect to the reinsurance contract. (4) When policies or annuities, or covered obligations with respect thereto, are transferred to an assuming insurer, reinsurance on the policies or annuities may also be transferred by the association, in the case of contracts assumed under subsection (1), subject to the following: (a) Unless the reinsurer and the assuming insurer agree otherwise, the reinsurance contract transferred may not cover any new policies of insurance or annuities in addition to those transferred; (b) The obligations described in the proviso to subsection (1)(b) of this subpart section no longer apply on and after the date the indemnity reinsurance agreement is transferred to the third party insurer with respect to matters arising after the effective date of the transfer; and (c) This subdivision (2) does not apply if the association has previously expressly determined in writing that it will not exercise the election referred to in subdivision (1) The transferring party shall give notice in writing, return receipt requested, to the affected reinsurer not less than thirty days prior to the effective date of the transfer; (3)(5) The provisions of this subpart subsection N shall supersede the provisions of any law of this state law or of any affected reinsurance agreement contract that provides for or requires any payment of reinsurance proceeds, on account of losses or events that occur in periods after the coverage date of the order of liquidation, to the receiver, liquidator, or rehabilitator of the insolvent member insurer or any other person. The receiver, rehabilitator, or liquidator shall remain entitled to any amounts payable by the reinsurer under the reinsurance agreement contracts with respect to losses or events that occur in periods prior to the coverage date ( of the order of liquidation, subject to applicable setoff provisions); and (4)(6) Except as otherwise expressly provided above in this section, nothing herein in subsection N alters or modifies the terms and conditions of the indemnity any reinsurance agreements of the insolvent member insurer contract. Nothing herein in this section abrogates or limits any rights of any reinsurer to claim that it is entitled to rescind a reinsurance agreement contract. Nothing herein in this section gives a policy owner or beneficiary an independent cause of action against an indemnity a reinsurer that is not otherwise set forth in the indemnity reinsurance agreement reinsurance contract. No provision in this section limits or affects the association's rights as a creditor of the estate against the assets of the estate. No provision in this section applies to reinsurance agreements covering property or casualty risks. O. The board of directors of the association shall have discretion and may exercise reasonable business judgment to determine the means by which the association is to provide the benefits of this chapter in an economical and efficient manner. P. Where the association has arranged or offered to provide the benefits of this chapter to a covered person under a plan or arrangement that fulfills the association's obligations under this chapter, the person is not entitled to benefits from the association in addition to or other than those provided under the plan or arrangement. Q. Venue in a suit against the association arising under the chapter shall be in Hughes County. The association may not be required to give an appeal bond in an appeal that relates to a cause of action arising under this chapter. R. In carrying out its duties in connection with guaranteeing, assuming, or reinsuring policies or contracts under subpart A or B, the association may, subject to approval of the receivership court, issue substitute coverage for a policy or contract that provides an interest rate, crediting rate, or similar factor determined by use of an index or other external reference stated in the policy or contract employed in calculating returns or changes in value by issuing an alternative policy or contract in accordance with the following provisions: (1) In lieu of the index or other external reference provided for in the original policy or contract, the alternative policy or contract provides for (i) a fixed interest rate or (ii) payment of dividends with minimum guarantees or (iii) different methods for calculating interest or changes in value; (2) There is no requirement for evidence of insurability, waiting period, or other exclusion that would not have applied under the replaced policy or contract; and (3) The alternative policy or contract is substantially similar to the replaced policy or contract in all other material terms. Section 5. That \u00a7 58-29C-52 be amended to read as follows: 58-29C-52. A. For the purpose of providing the funds necessary to carry out the powers and duties of the association, the board of directors shall assess the member insurers, separately for each account, at such time and for such amounts as the board finds necessary. Assessments shall be due not less than thirty days after prior written notice to the member insurers and shall accrue interest at ten percent per annum on and after the due date. B. There shall be two classes of assessments, as follows: (1) Class A assessments shall be authorized and called for the purpose of meeting administrative and legal costs and other expenses. Class A assessments may be authorized and called whether or not related to a particular impaired or insolvent insurer. (2) Class B assessments shall be authorized and called to the extent necessary to carry out the powers and duties of the association under \u00a7 58-29C-51 with regard to an impaired or an insolvent insurer. C. (1) The amount of a Class A assessment shall be determined by the board and may be authorized and called on a pro rata or nonpro rata basis. If pro rata, the board may provide that it be credited against future Class B assessments. The total of all nonpro rata assessments may not exceed one hundred fifty three hundred dollars per member insurer in any one calendar year. The amount of a Class B assessment shall be allocated for assessment purposes among the accounts pursuant to an allocation formula which may be based on the premiums or reserves of the impaired or insolvent insurer or any other standard deemed by the board in its sole discretion as being fair and reasonable under the circumstances. (2) Class B assessments against member insurers for each account and subaccount shall be in the proportion that the premiums received on business in this state by each assessed member insurer on policies or contracts covered by each account for the three most recent calendar years for which information is available preceding the year in which the insurer became insolvent (or, in the case of an assessment with respect to an impaired insurer, the three most recent calendar years for which information is available preceding the year in which the insurer became impaired) bears to premiums received on business in this state for those calendar years by all assessed member insurers. (3) Assessments for funds to meet the requirements of the association with respect to an impaired or insolvent insurer may not be authorized or called until necessary to implement the purposes of this chapter. Classification of assessments under subpart B and computation of assessments under this subpart shall be made with a reasonable degree of accurate accuracy, recognizing that exact determinations may not always be possible. The association shall notify each member insurer of its anticipated pro rata share of an authorized assessment not yet called within one hundred eighty days after the assessment is authorized. D. The association may abate or defer, in whole or in part, the assessment of a member insurer if, in the opinion of the board, payment of the assessment would endanger the ability of the member insurer to fulfill its contractual obligations. In the event an assessment against a member insurer is abated, or deferred in whole or in part, the amount by which the assessment is abated or deferred may be assessed against the other member insurers in a manner consistent with the basis for assessments set forth in this section. Once the conditions that caused a deferral have been removed or rectified, the member insurer shall pay all assessments that were deferred pursuant to a repayment plan approved by the association. E. (1)(a) Subject to the provisions of subsection (b) of this subdivision, the total of all assessments authorized by the association with respect to a member insurer for each subaccount of the life insurance and annuity account and for the health account may not in one calendar year exceed two percent of that member insurer's average annual premiums received in this state on the policies and contracts covered by the subaccount or account during the three calendar years preceding the year in which the insurer became an impaired or insolvent insurer. (b) If two or more assessments are authorized in one calendar year with respect to insurers that become impaired or insolvent in different calendar years, the average annual premiums for purposes of the aggregate assessment percentage limitation referenced in subsection (a) of this subdivision shall be equal and limited to the higher of the three-year average annual premiums for the applicable subaccount or account as calculated pursuant to this section. (c) If the maximum assessment, together with the other assets of the association in an account, does not provide in one year in either account an amount sufficient to carry out the responsibilities of the association, the necessary additional funds shall be assessed as soon thereafter as permitted by this chapter. (2) The board may provide in the plan of operation a method of allocating funds among claims, whether relating to one or more impaired or insolvent insurers, when the maximum assessment will be insufficient to cover anticipated claims. (3) If the maximum assessment for a subaccount of the life and annuity account in one year does not provide an amount sufficient to carry out the responsibilities of the association, then pursuant to subdivision C(2), the board shall access the other subaccounts of the life and annuity account for the necessary additional amount, subject to the maximum stated in subdivision (1) of this section. F. The board may, by an equitable method as established in the plan of operation, refund to member insurers, in proportion to the contribution of each insurer to that account, the amount by which the assets of the account exceed the amount the board finds is necessary to carry out during the coming year the obligations of the association with regard to that account, including assets accruing from assignment, subrogation, net realized gains, and income from investments. A reasonable amount may be retained in any account to provide funds for the continuing expenses of the association and for future losses claims. G. It shall be proper for any member insurer, in determining its premium rates and policy owner dividends as to any kind of insurance within the scope of this chapter, to consider the amount reasonably necessary to meet its assessment obligations under this chapter. H. The association shall issue to each insurer paying an assessment under this chapter, other than a Class A assessment, a certificate of contribution, in a form prescribed by the director, for the amount of the assessment so paid. All outstanding certificates shall be of equal dignity and priority without reference to amounts or dates of issue. A certificate of contribution may be shown by the insurer in its financial statement as an asset in such form and for such amount, if any, and period of time as the director may approve. I. (1) A member insurer that wishes to protest all or part of an assessment shall pay when due the full amount of the assessment as set forth in the notice provided by the association. The payment shall be available to meet association obligations during the pendency of the protest or any subsequent appeal. Payment shall be accompanied by a statement in writing that the payment is made under protest and setting forth a brief statement of the grounds for the protest. (2) Within sixty days following the payment of an assessment under protest by a member insurer, the association shall notify the member insurer in writing of its determination with respect to the protest unless the association notifies the member insurer that additional time is required to resolve the issues raised by the protest. (3) Within thirty days after a final decision has been made, the association shall notify the protesting member insurer in writing of that final decision. Within sixty days of receipt of notice of the final decision, the protesting member insurer may appeal that final action to the director. (4) In the alternative to rendering a final decision with respect to a protest based on a question regarding the assessment base, the association may refer protests to the director for a final decision, with or without a recommendation from the association. (5) If the protest or appeal on the assessment is upheld, the amount paid in error or excess shall be returned to the member company. Interest on a refund due a protesting member shall be paid at the rate actually earned by the association. J. The association may request information of member insurers in order to aid in the exercise of its power under this section and member insurers shall promptly comply with a request. Section 6. That \u00a7 58-29C-53 be amended to read as follows: 58-29C-53. A. (1) The association shall submit to the director a plan of operation and any amendments thereto necessary or suitable to assure the fair, reasonable, and equitable administration of the association. The plan of operation and any amendments thereto shall become effective upon the director's written approval or unless it has not been disapproved within thirty days. (2) If the association fails to submit a suitable plan of operation within one hundred twenty days following July 1, 2003, or if at any time thereafter the association fails to submit suitable amendments to the plan, the director shall, after notice and hearing, adopt and promulgate such reasonable rules as are necessary or advisable to effectuate the provisions of this chapter. The rules shall continue in force until modified by the director or superseded by a plan submitted by the association and approved by the director. B. All member insurers shall comply with the plan of operation. C. The plan of operation shall, in addition to requirements enumerated elsewhere in this chapter: (1) Establish procedures for handling the assets of the association; (2) Establish the amount and method of reimbursing members of the board of directors under \u00a7 58-29C-50; (3) Establish regular places and times for meetings including telephone conference calls of the board of directors; (4) Establish procedures for records to be kept of all financial transactions of the association, its agents, and the board of directors; (5) Establish the procedures whereby selections for the board of directors will be made and submitted to the director; (6) Establish any additional procedures for assessments under \u00a7 58-29C-52; (7) Contain additional provisions necessary or proper for the execution of the powers and duties of the association; (8) Establish procedures whereby a director may be removed for cause, including in the case where a member insurer director becomes an impaired or insolvent insurer; (9) Require the board of directors to establish a policy and procedures for addressing conflicts of interests. D. The plan of operation may provide that any or all powers and duties of the association, except those under subdivision 58-29C-51L(3) and \u00a7 58-29C-52, are delegated to a corporation, association, or other organization which performs or will perform functions similar to those of this association, or its equivalent, in two or more states. Such a corporation, association, or organization shall be reimbursed for any payments made on behalf of the association and shall be paid for its performance of any function of the association. A delegation under this subpart shall take effect only with the approval of both the board of directors and the director, and may be made only to a corporation, association, or organization which extends protection not substantially less favorable and effective than that provided by this chapter. Section 7. That \u00a7 58-29C-54 be amended to read as follows: 58-29C-54. In addition to the duties and powers enumerated elsewhere in this chapter, A. The director shall: (1) Upon request of the board of directors, provide the association with a statement of the premiums in this and any other appropriate states for each member insurer; (2) When an impairment is declared and the amount of the impairment is determined, serve a demand upon the impaired insurer to make good the impairment within a reasonable time; notice to the impaired insurer shall constitute notice to its shareholders, if any; the failure of the insurer to promptly comply with such demand shall not excuse the association from the performance of its powers and duties under this chapter; (3) In any liquidation or rehabilitation proceeding involving a domestic insurer, be appointed as the liquidator or rehabilitator. B. The director may suspend or revoke, after notice and hearing, the certificate of authority to transact insurance in this state of any member insurer which fails to pay an assessment when due or fails to comply with the plan of operation. As an alternative the director may levy a forfeiture on any member insurer that fails to pay an assessment when due. The forfeiture may not exceed five percent of the unpaid assessment per month, but no forfeiture shall be less than one hundred dollars per month. C. A final action of the board of directors or the association may be appealed to the director by a member insurer if the appeal is taken within sixty days of its receipt of notice of the final action being appealed. A final action or order of the director shall be subject to judicial review in a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with the laws of this state that apply to the actions or orders of the director. D. The liquidator, rehabilitator, or conservator of an impaired or insolvent insurer may notify all interested persons of the effect of this chapter. Section 8. That \u00a7 58-29C-57 be amended to read as follows: 58-29C-57. A. This chapter may not be construed to reduce the liability for unpaid assessments of the insureds of an impaired or insolvent insurer operating under a plan with assessment liability. B. Records shall be kept of all meetings of the board of directors to discuss the activities of the association in carrying out its powers and duties under \u00a7 58-29C-51. The records of the association with respect to an impaired or insolvent insurer may only not be disclosed upon prior to the termination of a liquidation, rehabilitation, or conservation proceeding involving the impaired or insolvent insurer, except (i) upon the termination of the impairment or insolvency of the insurer, or (ii) upon the order of a court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this subpart shall limit the duty of the association to render a report of its activities under \u00a7 58-29C-58. C. For the purpose of carrying out its obligations under this chapter, the association shall be deemed to be a creditor of the impaired or insolvent insurer to the extent of assets attributable to covered policies reduced by any amounts to which the association is entitled as subrogee pursuant to subpart \u00a7 58-29C-51K. Assets of the impaired or insolvent insurer attributable to covered policies shall be used to continue all covered policies and pay all contractual obligations of the impaired or insolvent insurer as required by this chapter. Assets attributable to covered policies, as used in this subpart, are that proportion of the assets which the reserves that should have been established for such policies bear to the reserves that should have been established for all policies of insurance written by the impaired or insolvent insurer. D. As a creditor of the impaired or insolvent insurer as established in subpart C of this section and consistent with \u00a7 58-29B-98, the association and other similar associations shall be entitled to receive a disbursement of assets out of the marshaled assets, from time to time as the assets become available to reimburse it, as a credit against contractual obligations under this chapter. If the liquidator has not, within one hundred twenty days of a final determination of insolvency of an insurer by the receivership court, made an application to the court for the approval of a proposal to disburse assets out of marshaled assets to guaranty associations having obligations because of the insolvency, then the association shall be entitled to make application to the receivership court for approval of its own proposal to disburse these assets. E. (1) Prior to the termination of any liquidation, rehabilitation, or conservation proceeding, the court may take into consideration the contributions of the respective parties, including the association, the shareholders, and policy owners of the insolvent insurer, and any other party with a bona fide interest, in making an equitable distribution of the ownership rights of the insolvent insurer. In such a determination, consideration shall be given to the welfare of the policy owners of the continuing or successor insurer. (2) No distribution to stockholders, if any, of an impaired or insolvent insurer shall be made until and unless the total amount of valid claims of the association with interest thereon for funds expended in carrying out its powers and duties under 58-29C-51 with respect to the insurer have been fully recovered by the association. F. (1) If an order for liquidation or rehabilitation of an insurer domiciled in this state has been entered, the receiver appointed under the order may has a right to recover on behalf of the insurer, from any affiliate that controlled it, the amount of distributions, other than stock dividends paid by the insurer on its capital stock, made at any time during the five years preceding the petition for liquidation or rehabilitation subject to the limitations of subdivisions (2) to (4), inclusive. (2) No such distribution is recoverable if the insurer shows that when paid the distribution was lawful and reasonable, and that the insurer did not know and could not reasonably have known that the distribution might adversely affect the ability of the insurer to fulfill its contractual obligations. (3) Any person who was an affiliate that controlled the insurer at the time the distributions were paid is liable up to the amount of distributions received. Any person who was an affiliate that controlled the insurer at the time the distributions were declared, shall be liable up to the amount of distributions which would have been received if they had been paid immediately. If two or more persons are liable with respect to the same distributions, they shall be jointly and severally liable. (4) The maximum amount recoverable under this subpart shall be the amount needed in excess of all other available assets of the insolvent insurer to pay the contractual obligations of the insolvent insurer. (5) If any person liable under subdivision (3) is insolvent, all its affiliates that controlled it at the time the distribution was paid, shall be jointly and severally liable for any resulting deficiency in the amount recovered from the insolvent affiliate. Section 9. That \u00a7 58-29C-60 be amended to read as follows: 58-29C-60. There is no liability on the part of and no cause of action of any nature may arise against any member insurer or its agents or employees, the association or its agents or employees, members of the board of directors, or the director or the director's representatives, for any action or omission by them in the performance of their powers and duties under this chapter. Immunity This immunity shall extend to the participation in any organization of one or more other state associations of similar purposes and to any such organization and its agents or employees. Section 10. That \u00a7 58-29C-61 be amended to read as follows: 58-29C-61. All proceedings in which the insolvent insurer is a party in any court in this state shall be stayed sixty one hundred eighty days from the date an order of liquidation, rehabilitation, or conservation is final to permit proper legal action by the association on any matters germane to its powers or duties. As to judgment under any decision, order, verdict, or finding based on default the association may apply to have such judgment set aside by the same court that made such judgment and shall be permitted to defend against such suit on the merits. Section 11. That \u00a7 58-29C-62 be amended to read as follows: 58-29C-62. A. No person, including an insurer, agent, or affiliate of an insurer may make, publish, disseminate, circulate, or place before the public, or cause directly or indirectly, to be made, published, disseminated, circulated, or placed before the public, in any newspaper, magazine, or other publication, or in the form of a notice, circulate circular, pamphlet, letter, or poster, or over any radio station or television station, or in any other way, any advertisement, announcement, or statement, written or oral, which uses the existence of the Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Association of this state for the purpose of sales, solicitation, or inducement to purchase any form of insurance covered by the South Dakota Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Association chapter. However, this section does not apply to the South Dakota Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Association or any other entity which does not sell or solicit insurance. B. Within one hundred eighty days of July 1, 2003, the association shall prepare a summary document describing the general purposes and current limitations of the chapter and complying with subpart C of this section. This document shall be submitted to the director for approval. At the expiration of the sixtieth day after the date on which the director approves the document, an insurer may not deliver a policy or contract to a policy or contract owner unless the summary document is delivered to the policy or contract owner at the time of delivery of the policy or contract. The document shall also be available upon request by a policy owner. The distribution, delivery, or contents or interpretation of this document does not guarantee that either the policy or the contract or the owner of the policy or contract is covered in the event of the impairment or insolvency of a member insurer. The description document shall be revised by the association as amendments to the chapter may require. Failure to receive this document does not giver give the policy owner, contract owner, certificate holder, or insured any greater rights than those stated in this chapter. C. The document prepared under subpart B shall contain a clear and conspicuous disclaimer on its face. The director shall establish the form and content of the disclaimer. The disclaimer shall: (1) State the name and address of the Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Association and insurance department; (2) Prominently warn the policy or contract owner that the Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Association may not cover the policy or, if coverage is available, it will be subject to substantial limitations and exclusions and conditioned on continued residence in this state; (3) State the types of policies for which guaranty funds will provide coverage; (4) State that the insurer and its agents are prohibited by law from using the existence of the Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Association for the purpose of sales, solicitation, or inducement to purchase any form of insurance; (5) State that the policy or contract owner should not rely on coverage under the Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Association when selecting an insurer; (6) Explain rights available and procedures for filing a complaint to allege a violation of any provisions of this chapter; and (7) Provide other information as directed by the director including sources for information about the financial condition of insurers provided that the information is not proprietary and is subject to disclosure under that state's public records law. D. A member insurer shall retain evidence of compliance with subpart B for so long as the policy or contract for which the notice is given remains in effect."}, {"bill_id": 4161, "bill_version_id":
