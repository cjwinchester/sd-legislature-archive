Notice of any such deposition pursuant to this section shall conform in all respects to the notice requirements contained in \u00a7 23A-12-2. The application for the order shall be in writing and made at least three days before the preliminary hearing or deposition. Upon timely receipt of the application, the court may order that the testimony of the victim given at the preliminary hearing or deposition be taken and preserved on videotape.
