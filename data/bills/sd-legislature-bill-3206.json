A portable electronics license issued under this Act authorizes any employee or authorized representative of the vendor to sell or offer coverage under a policy of portable electronics insurance to a customer at each location at which the vendor engages in portable electronics transactions. Each supervising entity shall maintain a registry of vendor locations which are authorized to sell or solicit portable electronics insurance coverage in this state. The registry shall be open to inspection by the director during regular business hours of the supervising entity. The supervising entity shall be subject to examination pursuant to the applicable provisions of chapter 58-3 and must otherwise comply with \u00a7 58-33-66. Section 4.

The training may be provided in electronic form. However, if conducted in an electronic form, the supervising entity shall implement a supplemental education program regarding the portable electronics insurance product that is conducted and overseen by a licensed producer of the supervising entity. Each employee and authorized representative shall receive basic instruction about the portable electronics insurance offered to customers and the disclosures required under section 4 of this Act.

If the portable electronics insurance coverage is included with the purchase or lease of portable electronics or related services, the vendor shall clearly and conspicuously disclose to the enrolled customer that the portable electronics insurance coverage is included with the portable electronics or related services. A vendor billing and collecting these charges is not required to maintain these funds in a segregated account if the vendor is authorized by the insurer to hold these funds in an alternative manner and remits such amounts to the supervising entity within sixty days of receipt. All funds received by a vendor from an enrolled customer for the sale of portable electronics insurance shall be considered funds held in trust by the vendor in a fiduciary capacity for the benefit of the insurer.

If the notice or correspondence is sent by electronic means, it shall be sent to the vendor of portable electronics at the vendor's electronic mail address specified for that purpose and to its affected enrolled customers' last known electronic mail address as provided by each enrolled customer to the insurer or vendor of portable electronics.
