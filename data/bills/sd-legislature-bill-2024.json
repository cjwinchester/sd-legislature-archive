BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That chapter 40-3 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: The signature, participation, or involvement, whether voluntary or mandatory, of an animal owner in any private or government-operated animal identification system or animal trace back system, whether voluntary or mandatory, does not give any state or federal agency or employee the right to enter property owned or leased by the animal owner without probable cause and a search warrant, unless the agency or employee has permission of the property owner and the animal owner. Section 2. That chapter 40-3 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: If, in the process of enrolling in or agreeing to participate in any animal identification system, an animal owner is offered a contract allowing entry or access to property that the animal owner owns or leases, the contract may pertain only to that specific animal identification system. The contract shall be clearly stated in layman's terms and shall refer explicitly to property access. Any provision in which an animal owner agrees to use tags or to follow other animal identification guidelines or requirements shall be part of a separate contract."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 2024, "action_date": "2010-01-27T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 11169, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/11169.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 197, "committee_id_action": 86, "committee_id_assigned": 87, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 2024, "action_date": "2010-02-11T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 11958, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/11958.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 87, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 2024, "action_date": "2010-02-11T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 12103, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/12103.pdf", "status_text": "Tabled", "journal_page": 362, "committee_id_action": 87, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 6364, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [831, 811, 832, 843, 792, 836, 841, 833, 746, 838, 789], "Excused": [828, 793]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/2024"}
