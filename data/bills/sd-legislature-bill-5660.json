BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. There is hereby created the Legislative Economic Development Investigative and Oversight Committee. The committee has comprehensive authority to monitor and analyze all ongoing investigations by whatever source, into the desirability, effectiveness, and administration of all state sponsored economic development programs and initiatives. The committee shall take special care to assemble, review, and question information relevant to the current controversy regarding various projects with EB-5 funding. It is the special mission of the committee to ensure that their fellow legislators and the general public have access to all significant information to enable the Legislature and the public to formulate comprehensive public policy to ensure that no irregularities, favoritism, negligence, or maladministration attach to future economic development in South Dakota. Section 2. The committee shall be composed of seven legislators. Six legislators shall be appointed by the Executive Board of the Legislative Research Council. No more than four may be members of the same house. No more than three may be members of the same party. The Executive Board shall then appoint co-chairs, one from each party. Section 3. After the appointments prescribed in section 2 of this Act, the Executive Board shall open itself to the receipt of applications from any other legislator who wishes to serve on the committee. Once the time set for the receipt of applications has passed, the chair of the Executive Board shall, in a public setting, draw the name of the seventh member by lot. Section 4. To accomplish the purposes set forth in section 1 of this Act, the committee may summon witnesses, and, if necessary, enforce the summons by the issuance of subpoena. Refusal to be examined as a witness constitutes contempt of the Legislature and may be appropriately punished during the term of the committee. Section 5. The committee shall continue for three years or until it deems its purposes accomplished and it votes to disband itself. The committee shall make a final report of its activities and findings to the Executive Board. The committee may also, from time to time, sponsor corrective legislation. Section 6. If any member of the committee leaves the Legislature or a vacancy occurs by any means, the vacancy shall be filled in the same manner and subject to the same restrictions as may have applied to the original appointment. Section 7. There is hereby appropriated from the general fund the sum of fifty thousand dollars ($50,000), or so much thereof as may be necessary, to the Legislative Research Council to effectuate the purposes of this Act. Section 8. The director of the Legislative Research Council shall approve vouchers and the state auditor shall draw warrants to pay expenditures authorized by this Act. Section 9. Whereas, this Act is necessary for the support of the state government and its existing public institutions, an emergency is hereby declared to exist, and this Act shall be in full force and effect from and after its passage and approval."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 5660, "action_date": "2014-02-04T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 29776, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/29776.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 267, "committee_id_action": 231, "committee_id_assigned": 224, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 5660, "action_date": "2014-02-10T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 29996, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/29996.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 224, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 5660, "action_date": "2014-02-10T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 30065, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/30065.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to the 41st legislative day", "journal_page": 347, "committee_id_action": 224, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 15802, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [467, 441, 478, 423, 461, 508, 460, 456, 442], "Nay": [455, 454, 458, 502]}}]}
