WHEREAS, federal Freedom to Farm legislation which passed in 1996, has failed miserably to provide a safety net for farm income; and WHEREAS, resulting overproduction of South Dakota commodities has led to prices far below the cost of production for South Dakota's family farmers; and WHEREAS, increased export volume since 1996 has not led to higher prices for South Dakota farm products; and WHEREAS, emergency bailout packages in 1998, 1999, and 2000 have not and will not fix a failed farm policy: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the House of Representatives of the Seventy- sixth Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the Senate concurring therein, that the South Dakota Legislature urges the United States Congress to immediately change the Freedom to Farm law by raising commodity loan rates, reinstituting a farmer-controlled reserve, and providing discretion for conservation-driven land idling incentives in times of oversupply, while retaining planting flexibility provisions in the commodity programs; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that United States farm policy benefits should be directed to family-sized farms, and loopholes allowing enormous payments to mega-farms should be eliminated."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 16373, "action_date": "2001-02-27T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 91027, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/91027.pdf", "status_text": "Adopt Resolution", "journal_page": 747, "committee_id_action": 712, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "F", "vote": {"vote_id": 51704, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [2514, 2515, 2519, 2522, 2526, 2528, 2533, 2537, 2538, 2544, 2545, 2546, 2553, 2556, 2557, 2558, 2559, 2561, 2563, 2564, 2565, 2566, 2570, 2571, 2572, 2575, 2577, 2579, 2582, 2583, 2586, 2588, 2592, 2593, 2595, 2596, 2599, 2600, 2601, 2603, 2604, 2605, 2608, 2610, 2612, 2613, 2618, 2540], "Yea": [2518, 2521, 2525, 2527, 2530, 2541, 2543, 2547, 2548, 2554, 2555, 2560, 2568, 2574, 2587, 2589, 2591, 2594, 2602, 2611, 2614], "Excused": [2578]}}]}
