No person who holds a license under Chapter 44 of Title 18, United States Code, nor any agent, servant, or employee of such a person, who sells a firearm in compliance with Chapter 44 of Title 18, United States Code, is liable to any person or entity, or to the estate, successors, or survivors of either, for any injury suffered, including wrongful death and property damage, because of the use of such firearm by a person other than the licensee. Section 3. No association of persons who hold licenses under Chapter 44 of Title 18, United States Code, is liable to any person or entity, or to the estate, successors, or survivors of either, for any injury suffered, including wrongful death and property damage, because of the use of a firearm sold or manufactured by any licensee who is a member of such association. 750 copies of this document were printed by the South Dakota Legislative Research Council at a cost of $.016 per page. .
