There is hereby appropriated from the general fund the sum of seventy-five thousand dollars ($75,000), or so much thereof as may be necessary, to the Board of Regents to create and fund a program of scholarships for children of graduates of the state-supported universities who are no longer South Dakota residents. The purposes of the scholarship program created in this Act are to benefit students of the regental institutions through exposure to and contact with persons whose experiences, values, and expectations come from environments that differ from South Dakota's; to assist economic development by encouraging university graduates who are no longer South Dakota residents to maintain a link to their home state and their alma maters through their children; to enrich South Dakota public university resources available to all South Dakotans; to enhance the quality of a public university education, both formally and informally, by expanding the pools of talent, diversity, and ability among South Dakota public universities' student bodies; and to expand the opportunities for scholarships and endowments that occur as a result of growth and prosperity of alumni. No scholarship authorized by this Act may be more than three thousand dollars per student per year. Only students enrolled in regental institutions, or accepted for enrollment, are eligible for scholarships created in this Act. The Board of Regents shall promulgate rules, pursuant to chapter 1-26, to establish eligibility criteria, application procedures, deadlines, and scholarship disbursement methods for the program, but may not impose on students applying under this Act entrance requirements based upon standardized test scores that are stricter than requirements of resident students. The Board of Regents may not award scholarships created by this Act when the universities have reached their enrollment capacities as determined by the board. Section 2. The executive director of the Board of Regents shall approve vouchers and the state auditor shall draw warrants to pay expenditures authorized by this Act. Section 3. Any amounts appropriated in this Act not lawfully expended or obligated by June 30, 2001, shall revert in accordance with \u00a7 4-8-21."}, {"bill_id": 15228, "bill_version_id": 86563, "bill_version": "Senate Appropriations Engrossed", "bill_version_date": "2000-02-18T00:00:00-06:00", "bill_text": "FOR AN ACT ENTITLED, An Act to authorize the Board of Regents to create a tuition-waiver for children of nonresident alumni.
