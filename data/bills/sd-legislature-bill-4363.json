BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 54-3-5.1 be amended to read as follows: 54-3-5.1. Interest is payable on all judgments and statutory liens, exclusive of real estate mortgages and security agreements under Title 57A, and exclusive of support debts or judgments under \u00a7 25-7A-14, at the Category B Category H rate of interest as established in \u00a7 54-3-16 from and after the date of judgment and date of filing statutory lien. On all judgments arising from inverse condemnation actions, interest is payable at the Category A rate of interest as established by \u00a7 54-3-16. Section 2. That \u00a7 25-7A-14 be amended to read as follows: 25-7A-14. The Department of Social Services or any support obligee may collect interest on the unpaid principal balance of a support debt or judgment for support at the Category D Category H rate of interest as established in \u00a7 54-3-16. Section 3. That \u00a7 21-1-13.1 be amended to read as follows: 21-1-13.1. Any person who is entitled to recover damages, whether in the principal action or by counterclaim, cross claim, or third-party claim, is entitled to recover interest thereon from the day that the loss or damage occurred, except during such time as the debtor is prevented by law, or by act of the creditor, from paying the debt. Prejudgment interest is not recoverable on future damages, punitive damages, or intangible damages such as pain and suffering, emotional distress, loss of consortium, injury to credit, reputation or financial standing, loss of enjoyment of life, or loss of society and companionship. If there is a question of fact as to when the loss or damage occurred, prejudgment interest shall commence on the date specified in the verdict or decision and shall run to, and include, the date of the verdict or, if there is no verdict, the date the judgment is entered. If necessary, special interrogatories shall be submitted to the jury. Prejudgment interest on damages arising from a contract shall be at the contract rate, if so provided in the contract; otherwise, if prejudgment interest is awarded, it shall be at the Category B Category H rate of interest specified in \u00a7 54-3-16. Prejudgment interest on damages arising from inverse condemnation actions shall be at the Category A rate of interest as specified by \u00a7 54-3-16 on the day judgment is entered. This section shall apply retroactively to the day the loss or damage occurred in any pending action for inverse condemnation. The court shall compute and award the interest provided in this section and shall include such interest in the judgment in the same manner as it taxes costs. Section 4. That \u00a7 54-3-16 be amended to read as follows: 54-3-16. The official state interest rates, as referenced throughout the South Dakota Codified Laws, are as follows: (1) Category A rate of interest is four and one-half percent per year; (2) Category B rate of interest is ten percent per year; (3) Category C rate of interest is twelve percent per year; (4) Category D rate of interest is one percent per month or fraction thereof; (5) Category E rate of interest is four percent per year; (6) Category F rate of interest is fifteen percent per year; and (7) Category G rate of interest is five-sixth percent per month or fraction thereof; and (8) Category H rate of interest is a rate equal to three percentage points above the prime rate in effect on January first of each year as reported by the federal reserve board in federal reserve statistical release H.15 and published by the state court administrator on the unified judicial system website."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 4363, "action_date": "2013-01-28T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 24817, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/24817.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 213, "committee_id_action": 202, "committee_id_assigned": 198, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 4363, "action_date": "2013-02-13T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 25176, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/25176.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 198, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 4363, "action_date": "2013-02-13T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 25653, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/25653.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to the 41st legislative day", "journal_page": 366, "committee_id_action": 198, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 13728, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [353, 351, 324, 350, 369, 359, 398, 406, 416, 402, 381, 334], "Nay": [348]}}]}
