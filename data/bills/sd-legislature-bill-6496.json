If the chief law enforcement officer is unable to make a certification as required by the section, the officer shall provide the applicant a written notice of the denial and reason for the determination. A chief law enforcement officer is not required to make any certification under this section the officer knows to be untrue, but may not refuse to provide certification based on a generalized objection to a private person or entity making, possessing, or receiving any firearm or any certain type of firearm otherwise permitted by law. Section 3.

The court shall review the chief law enforcement officer's decision to deny the certification de novo. If the court finds that the applicant is not prohibited by law from receiving or possessing the firearm, that the applicant is not the subject of a proceeding that could result in a prohibition, or that no substantial evidence supports the chief law enforcement officer's determination to deny the certification, the court shall order the chief law enforcement officer to issue the certification and award court costs and reasonable attorney's fees to the applicant."}, {"bill_id": 6496, "bill_version_id": 35178, "bill_version": "House Judiciary Engrossed", "bill_version_date": "2015-02-18T14:11:49.56-06:00", "bill_text": "FOR AN ACT ENTITLED, An Act to provide for the certification by a chief law enforcement officer of the transfer of certain firearms.
