The payday loan provider shall verify such information as follows: (1) Each payday loan provider shall maintain a common database and shall verify whether the provider or an affiliate has an outstanding payday loan transaction with a particular person or has terminated a transaction with that person within the previous twenty-four hours.

Section 3. That chapter 54-4 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: The division shall implement a common database with real-time access through an internet connection for payday loan providers. The database shall be accessible to the division and the payday loan providers in order to verify whether any payday loan transaction is outstanding for a particular person. No payday loan provider may enter into a payday loan transaction unless the provider has first submitted such data in such a format as required by the division in rules promulgated pursuant to chapter 1-26, including the person's name, social security number or employment authorization alien number, address, driver's license number, amount of the transaction, date of transaction, and the date that the transaction is closed.

A payday loan provider shall notify the division, in a manner as prescribed by rules promulgated pursuant to chapter 1-26, within fifteen business days after ceasing operations or no longer holding a license pursuant to this chapter. Such notification shall include a reconciliation of any open transactions. If the provider fails to provide notice, the division shall take action to administratively release any open and pending transactions in the database after the division becomes aware of the closure. This section does not affect the rights of the provider to enforce the contractual provisions of any payday loan transaction through any civil action allowed by law. The division shall adopt rules, pursuant to chapter 1-26, to administer this section and to ensure that the database is used by payday loan providers in accordance with this section."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 1025, "action_date": "2009-01-28T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 6143, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/6143.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 165, "committee_id_action": 56, "committee_id_assigned": 42, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 1025, "action_date": "2009-02-18T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 7397, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/7397.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 42, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 1025, "action_date": "2009-02-18T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 7681, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/7681.pdf", "status_text": "Hoghoused", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 42, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 1025, "action_date": "2009-02-18T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 7681, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/7681.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to the 41st legislative day", "journal_page": 413, "committee_id_action": 42, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 4235, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [716], "Yea": [692, 712, 644, 737, 717, 654, 637, 665, 713, 710, 679], "Excused": [646]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/1025"}
