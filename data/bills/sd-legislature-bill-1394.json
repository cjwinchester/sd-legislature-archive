BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 23-3-41 be amended to read as follows: 23-3-41. At the earliest practicable time, the commission shall provide, by regulation, that no person shall be appointed as a law enforcement officer, except on a temporary or probationary basis, unless such person has satisfactorily completed a preparatory program of law enforcement training at a school approved by the commission. Any person who is a citizen or permanent resident of the United States is eligible to be so appointed as a law enforcement officer and is then eligible for admission to any preparatory program of law enforcement training at any school approved by the commission. No law enforcement officer who lacks the education and training qualifications required by the commission may have his temporary or probationary employment extended beyond one year by renewal of appointment or otherwise. However, in municipalities of the third class, the probationary period may be extended for one additional year. Section 2. That \u00a7 23-3-42 be amended to read as follows: 23-3-42. In addition to the requirements of \u00a7 23-3-41, the commission, by rules promulgated pursuant to chapter 1-26, shall fix other qualifications for the employment and training of appointed law enforcement officers, including minimum age, education, physical and mental standards, citizenship, good moral character, experience, and such other matters as relate to the competence and reliability of persons to assume and discharge the various responsibilities of law enforcement officers. The commission shall also prescribe the means for presenting evidence of fulfillment of these requirements. Notwithstanding \u00a7\u00a7 23A-27-14 and 23A-27-17, any person seeking certification as a law enforcement officer who has received an order pursuant to \u00a7 23A-27-13 may have his or her application refused. Notwithstanding \u00a7\u00a7 26-7A-105 and 26-7A-106, any person seeking certification as a law enforcement officer who has received an adjudication or disposition pursuant to chapter 26-7A or 26-8C may have his or her application refused if the adjudication or disposition was for a crime which, if committed by an adult, would constitute a crime under chapter 22-42 that is punishable as a felony, a sex crime as defined in \u00a7 22-24B-1, or a crime of violence as defined in subdivision 22-1-2(9).
