Except as otherwise provided in this Act, other elements of the cause of action shall be shown by a preponderance of the evidence. Section 18. Any person against whom recovery is sought who has a criminal conviction under state or federal drug laws is estopped from denying participation in the illegal drug market. Such a conviction is also prima facie evidence of the person's participation in the illegal drug market during the two years preceding the date of an act giving rise to a conviction. The absence of criminal drug conviction of a person against whom recovery is sought does not bar an action against that person. Section 19. Any plaintiff under this Act may request an ex parte prejudgment attachment order from the court against all assets of a defendant sufficient to satisfy a potential award. If attachment is instituted, the defendant is entitled to an immediate hearing. Attachment may be lifted if the defendant demonstrates that the assets will be available for a potential award or if the defendant posts a bond sufficient to cover a potential award. Section 20.

Section 23. A cause of action accrues under this Act when a person who may recover has reason to know of the harm from illegal drug use that is the basis for the cause of action and has reason to know that the illegal drug use is the cause of the harm. For a plaintiff, the statute of limitations under this section is tolled while any potential plaintiff is incapacitated by the use of an illegal drug to the extent that the potential plaintiff cannot reasonably be expected to seek recovery under this Act or as otherwise provided by law. For a defendant, the statute of limitations under this section is tolled until six months after any potential defendant is convicted of a criminal drug offense or as otherwise provided by law.

Any user entitled to bring an action under section 9 of this Act may seek damages only from a person who distributed, or is in the chain of distribution of, an illegal drug that was actually used by the user. Section 11. Any person entitled to bring an action under section 9 of this Act may recover only the following damages: (1) Economic damages, including the cost of treatment, rehabilitation, and medical expenses, loss of economic or educational potential, loss of productivity, absenteeism, accidents or injury, and any other pecuniary loss proximately caused by the person's illegal drug use; (2) Attorneys' fees; and (3) Disbursements. Section 12. A person whose participation in the illegal drug market constitutes the following level of participation shall be considered to have the following illegal drug market target community: (1) For Level 4 participation, the county in which the defendant's place of participation is situated; (2) For Level 3 participation, the target community described subdivision (1) plus all counties with a border contiguous to that target community; and (3) For Level 2 participation, the target community described in subdivision (2) plus all counties with a border contiguous to that target community; (4) For Level 1 participation, the state. Section 13. Two or more persons may join in one action under this Act as plaintiffs if their respective actions have at least one place of illegal drug activity in common and if any portion of the period of illegal drug use overlaps with the period of illegal drug use for every other plaintiff. Two or more persons may be joined in one action under this Act as defendants if those persons are liable to at least one plaintiff. A plaintiff need not be interested in obtaining and a defendant need not be interested in defending against all the relief demanded. Judgment may be given for one or more plaintiffs according to their respective rights to relief and against one or more defendants according to their respective liabilities. Section 14. Any action by a user is governed by the principles of comparative responsibility. Comparative responsibility attributed to the plaintiff does not bar recovery but diminishes the award of compensatory damages proportionally, according to the measure of responsibility attributed to the plaintiff. The burden of proving the comparative responsibility of the plaintiff is on the defendant and shall be shown by clear and convincing evidence. Comparative responsibility may not be attributed to a plaintiff who is not a user. Section 15. That \u00a7 34-20B-51 be amended to read as follows: 34-20B-51. The liability of such distributor or dispenser under \u00a7 34-20B-50 shall extend to all damages adjudged to be actual and exemplary. In case of the death of either party, the right of action given in \u00a7 34-20B-50 this Act shall survive to or against such party's executor or administrator. Section 16. Any person subject to liability under this Act has a right of action for contribution against another person subject to liability under this Act. Contribution may be enforced either in the original action or by a separate action brought for that purpose. A plaintiff may seek recovery in accordance with this Act against a person whom a defendant has asserted a right of contribution. Section 17. Any person against whom recovery is sought who has a criminal conviction under state or federal drug laws is estopped from denying participation in the illegal drug market. Such a conviction is also prima facie evidence of the person's participation in the illegal drug market during the two years preceding the date of an act giving rise to a conviction. The absence of criminal drug conviction of a person against whom recovery is sought does not bar an action against that person. Section 18. Any person against whom a judgment has been rendered under this Act is not eligible to exempt any property, of whatever kind, from process to levy or process to execute on the judgment. Any assets sought to satisfy a judgment under this Act that are named in a forfeiture action or have been seized for forfeiture by any state or federal agency may not be used to satisfy a judgment unless and until the assets have been released following the conclusion of the forfeiture action or released by the agency that seized the assets. Section 19. That \u00a7 34-20B-53 be amended to read as follows: 34-20B-53. All damages recovered by a minor under \u00a7 \u00a7 34-20B-50 to 34-20B-52, inclusive, this Act shall be paid to such minor or to his the minor's parent or conservator as the court directs. Section 20. That \u00a7 34-20B-52 be amended to read as follows: 34-20B-52. All suits for damages under \u00a7 34-20B-50 this Act shall be by civil action in any court of this state having jurisdiction thereof, which shall be commenced within two years of the date on which the injury was incurred. Section 21. A cause of action accrues under this Act when a person who may recover has reason to know of the harm from illegal drug use that is the basis for the cause of action and has reason to know that the illegal drug use is the cause of the harm. For a plaintiff, the statute of limitations under this section is tolled while any potential plaintiff is incapacitated by the use of an illegal drug to the extent that the potential plaintiff cannot reasonably be expected to seek recovery under this Act or as otherwise provided by law. For a defendant, the statute of limitations under this section is tolled until six months after any potential defendant is convicted of a criminal drug offense or as otherwise provided by law. Section 22. On motion by a governmental agency involved in a drug investigation or prosecution, an action brought under this Act shall be stayed until the completion of the criminal investigation or prosecution that gave rise to the motion for a stay of the action.
