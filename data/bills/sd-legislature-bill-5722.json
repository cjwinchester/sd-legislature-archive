A person using artificial light to take coyotes under this section may use any firearm that may otherwise be used to take coyotes, raccoons, or skunks during nighttime hours. The Game, Fish and Parks Commission shall promulgate rules pursuant to chapter 1-26 to provide for the issuance of permits to authorize the use of artificial light in taking coyotes as provided in this section. The rules may require a fee not to exceed twenty dollars for each permit to be issued.
