That chapter 23A-22 be amended with a NEW SECTION: A lineup conducted by any law enforcement agency of this state or any political subdivision thereof must meet the following requirements: (1) The administrator of a live or photogenic lineup shall be unaware of which person in the lineup is the suspected perpetrator of the crime under investigation, or, if that is not reasonably practical, the administrator shall use a photographic lineup that prevents the administrator from seeing which member of the photographic lineup is being viewed by the eyewitness; (2) Before the lineup is administered, the eyewitness shall be instructed that the perpetrator may or may not be in the lineup; (3) Any person who is not the suspected perpetrator in the lineup shall be substantially similar to the eyewitness's description of the perpetrator; and (4) Immediately after an identification is made, the eyewitness shall provide a statement in the eyewitness's own words that articulates the level of the eyewitness's confidence in the identification. Section 2.
