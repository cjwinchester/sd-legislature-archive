WHEREAS, the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) are a set of academic standards, promoted and supported by two private membership organizations, the National Governor's Association (NGA) and the Council of Chief State School Officers (CCSSO), as a method that requires American students to conform to uniform, one size fits all, achievement goals to make them more competitive in a global marketplace; and WHEREAS, the NGA and the CCSSO received tens of millions of dollars from private third parties to advocate for and develop the CCSS strategy and subsequently created the CCSS through a process that was not subject to any freedom of information acts or other sunshine laws; and WHEREAS, even though federal law prohibits the federalizing of curriculum, the Obama Administration accepted the CCSS plan and used 2009 Stimulus Bill money to reward the states that were most committed to the president's CCSS agenda, but they failed to give states, their legislatures, and their citizens time to evaluate the CCSS before having to commit to them; and WHEREAS, the NGA and CCSSO in concert with the same corporations developing the CCSS assessments have created new textbooks, digital media, and other teaching materials aligned to the standards, which must be purchased and adopted by local school districts in order that students may effectively compete on CCSS assessments; and WHEREAS, the CCSS program includes federally funded testing and the collection and sharing of massive amounts of personal student and teacher data; and WHEREAS, the CCSS effectively removes educational choice and competition since all schools and all districts must use Common Core assessments based on the Common Core standards to allow all students to advance in the school system and to advance to higher education pursuits: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the Senate of the Eighty-Ninth Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the House of Representatives concurring therein, that the South Dakota Legislature does not believe in a one size fits all approach to education and supports providing broad education choices to parents and children at the state and local level, which is best based on a free market approach to education for students to achieve individual excellence; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Legislature recognizes the CCSS for what it is, an inappropriate overreach to standardize and control the education of our children so they will conform to a preconceived normal; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Legislature rejects the collection of personal student data for any noneducational purpose without the prior written consent of an adult student or a child student's parent, and that it rejects the sharing of such personal data, without the prior written consent of an adult student or a child student's parent, with any person or entity other than schools or education agencies within the state; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Legislature recognizes the need to repeal the numerous federal regulations that interfere with state and local control of public schools. Therefore, the Legislature rejects this CCSS plan which creates and fits the country with a nationwide straitjacket on academic freedom and achievement."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 5965, "action_date": "2014-02-11T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 30211, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/30211.pdf", "status_text": "First read and referred to", "journal_page": 287, "committee_id_action": 229, "committee_id_assigned": 207, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 5965, "action_date": "2014-02-20T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 30236, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/30236.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 207, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 5965, "action_date": "2014-02-20T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 30659, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/30659.pdf", "status_text": "Motion to amend", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 207, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 5965, "action_date": "2014-02-20T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 30659, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/30659.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass Amended", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 207, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "F", "vote": {"vote_id": 16309, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [846, 465, 438], "Excused": [847], "Nay": [475, 493, 490]}}, {"bill_id": 5965, "action_date": "2014-02-20T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 30659, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/30659.pdf", "status_text": "Tabled", "journal_page": 378, "committee_id_action": 207, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 16313, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [846, 465, 438, 475, 490], "Excused": [847], "Nay": [493]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/5965"}
