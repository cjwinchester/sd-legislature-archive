BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 47-8-17 be amended to read as follows: 47-8-17. If a foreign corporation makes a contract with a resident of South Dakota to be performed in whole or in part by either party in South Dakota, or if such foreign corporation commits a tort in whole or in part in South Dakota against a resident of South Dakota, such acts shall be deemed to be doing business in South Dakota by the foreign corporation and shall be deemed equivalent to the appointment by the foreign corporation of the secretary of state of the State of South Dakota and his successors to be its true and lawful attorney upon whom may be served all lawful process in any actions or proceedings against the foreign corporation arising from or growing out of such contract or tort. The making of the contract or the committing of the tort shall be deemed to be the agreement of the foreign corporation that any process against it which is so served upon the secretary of state shall be of the same legal force and effect as if served personally within the State of South Dakota. A foreign corporation without a certificate of authority, by virtue of its acceptance of the privilege extended by law to nonresidents and others to operate, conduct, engage in, and carry on business in this state, constitutes an appointment by the foreign corporation of the secretary of state as its agent on whom all process and any action or proceeding against it, arising out of the transaction, operation, or connected with the transaction of business in this state, may be served with the same legal force and effect as if served personally within the State of South Dakota. Any corporation that sells, consigns, or leases by any means whatsoever tangible or intangible personal property through brokers, jobbers, wholesalers, or distributors to any person, firm, or corporation in this state, is conclusively presumed to be both engaged in substantial and not an isolated activity within this state, and in operating, conducting, engaging in, or carrying on a business in this state."}, {"bill_id": 16972, "bill_version_id": 93081, "bill_version": "Enrolled", "bill_version_date": "2002-01-29T09:32:40-06:00", "bill_text": ""}], "amendments": [],
