BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 13-27-1 be amended to read as follows: 13-27-1. (Text of section effective July 1, 2010) Any person having control of a child, who is not younger than five or older than six years old by the first day of September, or any child who, by the first day of September, is at least six years old, but who has not exceeded the age of eighteen sixteen, shall cause the child to regularly attend some public or nonpublic school for the entire term during which the public school in the district in which the person resides, or the school to which the child is assigned to attend, is in session, until the child reaches the age of eighteen sixteen years, unless the child has graduated or is excused as provided in this chapter. However, the requirements of this section are met if a child who is at least sixteen years of age enrolls in a general education development test preparation program that is school-based or for which a school contracts and the child successfully completes the test or reaches the age of eighteen years. A child is eligible to enroll in a school-based or school-contracted general education development test preparation program or take the general education development test if the child is sixteen or seventeen years of age, and the child presents written permission from the child's parent or guardian and one of the following: (1) Verification from a school administrator that the child will not graduate with the child's cohort class because of credit deficiency; (2) Authorization from a court services officer; (3) A court order requiring the child to enter the program; (4) Verification that the child is under the direction of the Department of Corrections; or (5) Verification that the child is enrolled in Job Corps as authorized by Title I-C of the Workforce Investment Act of 1998, as amended to January 1, 2009. Any child who is sixteen or seventeen years of age and who completes the general education development test preparation program may take the general education development test immediately following release from the school program or when ordered to take the test by a court. Any such child who fails to successfully complete the test shall re-enroll in the school district and may continue the general education development preparation program or other suitable program as determined by the school district. All children shall attend kindergarten prior to age seven. Any child who transfers from another state may proceed in a continuous educational program without interruption if the child has not previously attended kindergarten."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 1856, "action_date": "2010-01-28T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 11385, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/11385.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 219, "committee_id_action": 86, "committee_id_assigned": 73, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 1856, "action_date": "2010-02-17T07:30:00-06:00", "document_id": 12218, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/12218.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 73, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 1856, "action_date": "2010-02-22T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 12623, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/12623.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 73, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 1856, "action_date": "2010-02-22T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 12711, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/12711.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to the 41st legislative day", "journal_page": 500, "committee_id_action": 73, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 6878, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [825, 793, 834, 783, 789], "Yea": [813, 817, 757, 819, 841, 833, 763, 828, 801], "Excused": [829]}}]}
