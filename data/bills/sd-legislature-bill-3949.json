If the grant, denial, or renewal of a license, resident license, or certificate, or permit to practice medicine allopathic or osteopathic medicine was previously treated as a contested case resulting in a final decision, the provisions of chapter 1-26 concerning contested cases do not apply unless the Board of Examiners determines that there has been a substantial change of circumstance since the proceedings in the prior contested case. Section 16. That \u00a7 36-4-32 be amended to read as follows: 36-4-32. In case any person holding a license, resident license, or certificate, or permit to practice medicine allopathic or osteopathic medicine, surgery and obstetrics shall by any final order or adjudication of any court of competent jurisdiction be adjudged to be mentally incompetent or insane, the license, resident license, or certificate, or permit shall be suspended by the board after proceedings in compliance with chapter 1-26, and anything in this chapter to the contrary notwithstanding, such suspension shall continue until the licensee, resident licensee, or certificate holder, or permit holder is found or adjudged by such court to be restored to reason or until the holder of the license, resident license, or certificate, or permit is duly discharged as restored to reason in any other manner provided by law and has appeared before the board at a regular or special meeting of the board to apply for such reinstatement. The board may, in its discretion, establish such probationary conditions as it deems necessary for the best interests of licensee, resident licensee, or certificate holder, or permit holder. Section 17. That \u00a7 36-4-34 be amended to read as follows: 36-4-34. If it appears from evidence satisfactory to the Board of Examiners that any person has violated the provisions of this chapter or that any licensee, resident licensee, or certificate holder, or permit holder under this chapter has been guilty of unprofessional or dishonorable conduct or is incompetent, the board may apply for an injunction in any court of competent jurisdiction to restrain the person or licensee, resident licensee, or certificate holder, or permit holder from continuing to practice allopathic or osteopathic medicine, osteopathy, surgery, or obstetrics in any of their branches in this state. Application for an injunction is an alternate to criminal proceedings, and the commencement of one proceeding by the board constitutes an election."}, {"bill_id": 3949, "bill_version_id": 26437,
