BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 13-10-6 be amended to read as follows: 13-10-6. For the purpose of continuing a fund for the payment of pensions to retired employees of a school district that has established such system, the school district may levy an annual tax not exceeding thirty cents per thousand dollars of taxable valuation of the school district for the current year. The levy may not be included in determining the tax levy limitation of the school district provided by law. Moneys collected from the tax shall be kept by the business manager in a special pension fund and may not be used for any other purpose except upon discontinuance of the pension system by the school district, in which case any unexpended balance shall be transferred to the general fund. For taxes payable in 2011, the total amount of revenue payable from the levy provided in this section may not increase more than the lesser of three percent or the index factor, as defined in \u00a7 10-13-38, over the maximum amount of revenue that could have been generated for the taxes payable in 2010. After applying the index factor, a school district may increase the revenue payable from taxes on real property above the limitations provided by this section by the percentage increase of value resulting from any improvements or change in use of real property, annexation, minor boundary changes, and any adjustments in taxation of real property separately classified and subject to statutory adjustments and reductions under chapters 10-4, 10-6, 10-6A, and 10-6B, except \u00a7 10-6-31.4, only if assessed the same as property of equal value. For taxes payable in 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015, to 2019, inclusive, the total amount of revenue payable from the levy provided in this section may not increase more than the lesser of three percent or the index factor, as defined in \u00a7 10-13-38, over the maximum amount of revenue that could have been generated for the taxes payable in 2010 plus any unused index factor from the previous years. After applying the index factor, a school district may increase the revenue payable from taxes on real property above the limitations provided by this section by the percentage increase of value resulting from any improvements or change in use of real property, annexation, minor boundary changes, and any adjustments in taxation of real property separately classified and subject to statutory adjustments and reductions under chapters 10-4, 10-6, 10-6A, and 10-6B, except \u00a7 10-6-31.4, only if assessed the same as property of equal value. Any school district created or reorganized after January 1, 2009, is exempt from the limitation provided by this section for a period of two years immediately following its creation.
