WHEREAS, tribal historic preservation offices were established through federal legislation in 1996 and funded through the United States National Park Service; and WHEREAS, tribal historic preservation offices were created primarily to allow tribes to take the role as cultural resource managers of their own tribal cultural properties. Through their historic preservation offices, tribes are able to negotiate with federal agencies in protecting and preserving their cultural resources; and WHEREAS, tribal historic preservation offices deal with federal agencies on a government-to-government basis and extend into many states. If cultural sites are found, the office is notified. Tribal offices are involved in findings that result from federal projects or undertakings, and tribal historic preservation offices have an interest in cultural landscapes and sites wherever Native American people have had historic and cultural ties; and WHEREAS, one issue that frequently involves tribal historic preservation offices is the disposition and repatriation of human remains and cultural artifacts associated with the tribe; and WHEREAS, both state and tribal historic preservation offices could benefit from closer coordination and communication; and WHEREAS, tribal historic preservation offices have not received adequate federal funding. In addition, there have been disparities in funding for state and tribal historic preservation offices, as tribal offices assumed some of the workload for state offices, but have not received sufficient levels of federal funding: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the Senate of the Eighty-Third Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the House of Representatives concurring therein, that the South Dakota Legislature recognizes and appreciates the role of tribal historic preservation offices in South Dakota and in other states and urges the federal government to provide adequate funding for them. The Legislature supports federal funding of tribal historic preservation offices at the same level as state historic preservation offices, as tribal historic preservation offices have been charged with the same obligations and responsibilities under the law as state historic preservation offices."}, {"bill_id": 4667, "bill_version_id": 1577, "bill_version": "Enrolled", "bill_version_date": "2008-01-23T08:32:53.14-06:00", "bill_text": ""}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 4667, "action_date": "2008-01-08T12:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 560, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/560.pdf", "status_text": "First read and referred to", "journal_page": 11, "committee_id_action": 28, "committee_id_assigned": 3, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 4667, "action_date": "2008-01-15T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 694, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/694.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 3, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 4667, "action_date": "2008-01-15T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 1012, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/1012.pdf", "status_text": "Adopt Resolution", "journal_page": 111, "committee_id_action": 3, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 168, "president_vote": null, "Excused": [598], "Yea": [562, 613, 577, 539, 569, 588]}}, {"bill_id": 4667, "action_date": "2008-01-16T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 1255, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/1255.pdf", "status_text": "Adopt Resolution", "journal_page": 131, "committee_id_action": 28, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 273, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [557, 576, 621, 553, 596, 560, 590, 598, 592, 530, 601, 567, 535, 533, 582, 562, 622, 584, 569, 573, 618, 610, 629, 613, 632, 577, 588, 539, 627, 548, 550, 541, 607], "Excused": [604], "Nay": [545]}}, {"bill_id": 4667, "action_date": "2008-01-17T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 1372, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/1372.pdf", "status_text": "First Reading", "journal_page": 175, "committee_id_action": 27, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 4667, "action_date": "2008-01-22T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 1529, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/1529.pdf", "status_text": "Concurred in Resolution", "journal_page": 196, "committee_id_action": 27, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 429, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [602, 579, 609, 614, 625, 593, 586, 570, 597, 532, 608, 623, 574, 534, 555, 542, 568, 552, 575, 580, 572, 624, 595, 529, 594, 631, 565, 620, 556, 585, 589, 633, 543, 558, 605, 628, 630, 571, 581, 544, 546, 537, 536, 578, 612, 551, 599, 617, 554, 547, 583, 538, 603, 615, 600, 531, 540, 566, 549, 619, 626, 611, 587, 559, 564, 561, 591], "Nay": [616, 563], "Excused": [606]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/4667"}
