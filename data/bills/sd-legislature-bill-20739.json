For the purposes of this Act, the term, complication associated with abortion, means any adverse physical, emotional, behavioral, familial, or psychological reaction that is statistically associated with abortion, which means there is less than a five percent chance that the results were due to sampling error. Section 3. Except in the case of a medical emergency, in addition to whatever requirements exist under the common or statutory law of this state, it is an act of medical negligence to perform an abortion unless: (1) Before the physician performs an abortion, a qualified person has evaluated the woman to identify the presence of any risk factors and informed her and the physician of the results of this evaluation in writing, which includes at least a checklist identifying both the positive and negative results of the evaluation for each risk factor; (2) In the event that any risk factors were identified, the patient has been fully informed by a qualified person about each complication associated with abortion that is associated with each risk factor that was identified. In the event that risk factors are known to be interrelated and may compound the risk of adverse reactions, these interrelated effects shall also be explained; (3) In the event that any risk factors were identified, the qualified person who has provided the screening and counseling provides a written statement to the patient and the physician certifying, to the best of the qualified person's knowledge, that the patient fully understands and appreciates the significance of the risk factors discussed and her increased exposure to any related adverse reactions. The risk factors and associated complications associated with abortion shall be listed in this certificate. Section 4. Nothing in this Act may be construed to render any of the requirements otherwise imposed by common law or existing statutory law inapplicable to abortion procedures or diminish the nature or the extent of those requirements.
