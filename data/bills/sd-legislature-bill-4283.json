However, no such grant may exceed fifty percent of the state sales and use tax collected from such project. Section 5.

If the municipality has adopted a resolution to approve the municipal sales and use tax being deposited in the economic development grant fund pursuant to section 3 of this Act, an application and business plan shall be submitted to the Board of Economic Development.

Moreover, any such claim is barred from any future grant eligibility. Section 10. No document or record in support of any claim for grant may be considered by the GOED if the document or record in support of any claim for a grant is received twelve months after the thirty-six month time period of section 5 of this Act.
