BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 15-26A-26 be amended to read as follows: 15-26A-26. If the appeal is from a judgment directing the payment of money, the conditions of the bond required by \u00a7 15-26A-25 shall be the payment of the judgment or that part of the judgment which is affirmed together with interest thereon from the date of the judgment. The amount of the bond may not exceed twenty-five million dollars regardless of the amount of judgment. However, if an appellee proves by a preponderance of the evidence that an appellant is dissipating assets outside the ordinary course of business to avoid payment of a judgment, the court may require the appellant to execute a bond in the amount of the judgment. 350 copies of this document were printed by the South Dakota Legislative Research Council at a cost of $.027 per page. .
