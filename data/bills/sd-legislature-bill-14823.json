BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. There is hereby established the South Dakota Public Defender Commission to provide, supervise, and coordinate legal representation at public expense for indigent persons who are charged with a crime which is punishable as a Class A, Class B, or Class 1 felony, including appeals from convictions for such felonies, and who is not entitled to legal defense by a county public defender. The commission shall consist of five members, one of whom shall be the chair. The chair and one other member shall be appointed by the Governor, two members shall be appointed by the Supreme Court, and one member shall be appointed by the president of the State Bar of South Dakota. The chair, the member appointed by the president of the State Bar of South Dakota, and at least one member appointed by the Supreme Court shall be attorneys admitted to the practice of law in this state. Members' terms shall be five years, but the terms of the initial members shall be determined by lot so that the term of one member expires each year. Section 2. The South Dakota Public Defender Commission shall appoint the state public defender, who shall serve at the pleasure of the commission, and who shall be experienced in the defense of criminal cases. The state public defender may employ, with the approval of the commission, necessary assistant public defenders and other employees at salaries approved by the commission, which assistant public defenders shall serve at the pleasure of the state public defender. The state public defender shall serve full-time and may not engage in the private practice of law. Assistant public defenders and other employees may serve full-time or part-time as determined by the state public defender. Section 3. The state public defender may employ law students authorized by the Supreme Court to engage in a limited form of the practice of law and may enter into agreements with law schools to provide clinical training for their students under the provisions of the Higher Education Act of 1965 and other similar federal programs. Section 4. Any person who is charged with a crime punishable as a Class A, Class B, or Class 1 felony, or who is party to an appeal concerning such charge and who requests appointment of counsel may be represented by the state public defender. Upon a request for the appointment of counsel, the court shall proceed to make appropriate inquiry into the financial circumstances of the applicant who shall submit, unless waived in whole or in part by the court, a financial statement under oath or affirmation setting forth the applicant's assets and liabilities, sources of income, and such other information as may be required by the court. A refusal to execute a financial statement as provided in this section constitutes a waiver of the right to the appointment of the state public defender. Section 5. The court may appoint counsel other than the state public defender to represent indigent defendants charged with a crime described in section 1 of this Act in situations in which there are multiple defendants requiring separate representation or other exigent circumstances which in the opinion of the court require appointment of other than the state public defender. Section 6. One-half of the annual budget of the commission shall be paid by the fund established pursuant to \u00a7 7-16B-13 in accordance with rules, consistent with the factors provided for in subdivisions 7-16B-20(1) and (2), promulgated by the commission pursuant to chapter 1- 26 which shall provide for quarterly assessments to all counties which do not provide a public defender to represent a person charged with a crime punishable as a Class A, Class B, or Class 1 felony.
