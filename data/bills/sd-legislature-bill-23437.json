Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of South Dakota: Section 1. An interim juvenile placement committee is established to consider and develop alternatives for placement of juvenile offenders, develop findings, report on the findings, and recommend legislation. The speaker shall appoint five members of the House of Representatives. The president pro tempore shall appoint five members of the Senate. The Governor shall appoint five individuals with knowledge and experience in juvenile justice. If there is a vacancy on the committee, the vacancy may be filled in the same manner as the original appointment. The committee shall be under the supervision of the Executive Board of the Legislative Research Council and staffed and funded as an interim legislative committee. The committee shall deliver its report and recommended legislation to the Legislature by January 1, 2023. Section 2. That \u00a7 23-1A-2.1 be REPEALED: The attorney general may revise the uniform traffic ticket created pursuant to chapter 23-1A to be used for juvenile cited violations. Section 3. That \u00a7 26-7A-10 be AMENDED: 26-7A-10. If a state's attorney is informed by a law enforcement officer or any other person that a child is, or appears to be, within the purview of this chapter and chapter 26-8A, 26-8B, or 26-8C, the state's attorney shall make a preliminary investigation to determine whether further action shall should be taken. On the basis of the preliminary investigation, the state's attorney may: (1) Decide that no further action is required; (2) If the report relates to an apparent abused or neglected child and if additional information is required, refer the matter to the Department of Social Services for further investigation and recommendations; (3) If the report relates to a juvenile cited violation, proceed on the citation; (4) If the report relates to an apparent child in need of supervision, or an apparent delinquent child, or a juvenile cited violation, refer the matter to a court services officer for any informal adjustment to the supervision of the court that is practicable without a petition or refer the matter to a court-approved juvenile diversion program for any informal action outside the court system that is practicable without the filing of a petition; or (5)(4) File a petition to commence appropriate proceedings in any case that the youth does not meet the criteria provided in \u00a7 26-7A-11.1. Section 4. That \u00a7 26-7A-11 be AMENDED: 26-7A-11. A report of a preliminary investigation involving any apparent child in need of supervision, or any apparent delinquent child, or any juvenile cited violation, may be referred to a court services officer for informal adjustment or to a court-approved juvenile diversion program for informal action pursuant to subdivision 26-7A-10(4) under \u00a7 26-7A-10 only if: (1) The child and the child's parents, guardian, or other custodian were informed of their constitutional and legal rights, including being represented by an attorney at every stage of the proceedings if a petition is filed; (2) The facts are admitted and establish prima facie jurisdiction; and (3) Written consent is obtained from the child's parents, guardian, or custodian and from the child if the child is of sufficient age and understanding. Efforts to effect informal adjustment or informal action may extend no longer than four six months from the date of the consent. The state's attorney may include in the referral to a court-approved juvenile diversion program a requirement that restitution as defined in subdivision 23A-28-2(4) be imposed as a condition of the diversion program. Section 5. That \u00a7 26-7A-11.1 be REPEALED: Any apparent child in need of supervision or any apparent delinquent child shall be referred for informal adjustment or informal action pursuant to subdivision 26-7A-10(4) if the following criteria are met: (1) The child has no prior adjudications; (2) The child has had no informal adjustment or informal action within the last twelve months; (3) The child is an apparent child in need of supervision pursuant to \u00a7 26-8B-2 or an apparent delinquent pursuant to \u00a7 26-8C-2 and the alleged conduct constitutes a misdemeanor; (4) The child's alleged conduct did not include use of violence or force against another; and (5) All of the requirements in \u00a7 26-7A-11 are met. If the state's attorney has good cause to believe that informal adjustment or informal action is insufficient to meet the purposes of this chapter and chapters 26-8B and 26-8C, the state's attorney may file a delinquency or child in need of supervision petition pursuant to subdivision 26-7A-10(5). The petition shall include notice of the departure from informal adjustment or informal action and notice to the child of the child's right to move for informal adjustment or informal action. Upon motion of the child and upon a finding that no good cause exists, the court may refer the child to informal adjustment or informal action pursuant to subdivision 26-7A-10(4). Section 6. That \u00a7 26-7A-125 be REPEALED: The Supreme Court shall establish rules, pursuant to \u00a7 16-3-1, to develop a graduated sanctions and incentives procedure and grid to guide court services officers in determining the appropriate response to a violation of terms or conditions of probation in juvenile cases. If the graduated sanctions program includes detention, a stay may not exceed forty-eight hours, and may not exceed twenty-four hours for children in need of supervision pursuant to \u00a7 26-8B-3. The Unified Judicial System shall collect data related to the use of sanctions, grid compliance and program outcomes, and shall include a process for reviewing sanctions that are challenged by the juvenile. The system of graduated sanctions shall be created with the following objectives: (1) Responding to violations of probation quickly, consistently, and proportionally; (2) Reducing the time and resources expended by the court to respond to violations; and (3) Reducing the likelihood of a new delinquent act. Section 7. That \u00a7 26-7A-126 be REPEALED: The following allegations of delinquency and children in need of supervision shall be treated as juvenile cited violations by law enforcement: (1) Petty theft in the second degree pursuant to \u00a7 22-30A-17.3; (2) Intentional damage to property, four hundred dollars or less, pursuant to \u00a7 22-34-1; (3) Purchase, possession, or consumption of alcoholic beverage by person under twenty-one years pursuant to \u00a7 35-9-2 in accordance with subdivision 26-8B-2(5); and (4) Truancy pursuant to subdivision 26-8B-2(1). The issuing officer shall notify the child and the child's parent, guardian, or custodian that a hearing on the citation for a cited violation shall be held before a judicial circuit court judge within ten days of issuance of the citation or on the next available court date and be treated as a confidential juvenile matter. The hearing shall be held pursuant to \u00a7 26-7A-36 and the case records shall be treated as confidential consistent with the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 26-7A-114, 26-7A-115, 26-7A-116, 26-7A-120, and 26-7A-27. A cited violation is not an adjudication or a child in need of supervision or delinquency proceeding. In lieu of a citation, pursuant to subdivision 26-7A-126(4), a school official may file a report with the state's attorney. A report may also be filed with the state's attorney in lieu of a citation if the conduct occurs in conjunction with another offense that is not subject to the juvenile cited violation process. Section 8. That \u00a7 26-7A-127 be REPEALED: If a state's attorney is informed that a citation or report has been issued for a juvenile cited violation, the state's attorney may take any action permitted pursuant to \u00a7 26-7A-10, except that a state's attorney may only file a petition pursuant to subdivision 26-7A-10(5) if: (1) The child is cited or a report is filed pursuant to subdivision 26-7A-126(1), (2), or (4); or (2) The child is cited pursuant to subdivision 26-7A-126(3), and has two or more prior judgments for the same violation. If the state's attorney intends to proceed on a petition for a violation of the provisions in \u00a7 26-7A-126 pursuant to subdivision (1) or (2) in this section, the provisions of \u00a7 26-7A-11.1 apply. Section 9. That \u00a7 26-7A-128 be REPEALED: If the state's attorney elects to proceed on the citation pursuant to subdivision 26-7A-10(3), the child shall be asked for an admission or denial of the alleged violation. If the child admits to the violation, the court shall accept the admission and enter a judgment pursuant to \u00a7 26-7A-129. If the child denies committing the violation, the case may be tried according to procedure adopted by the presiding judge of each judicial circuit and approved by the Supreme Court, but a jury trial may not be granted. If the child fails to appear in court at the time set in the citation or set by subsequent postponement, the court may either issue a summons to appear and set a new date for hearing to show cause, the court may consider that failure to appear constitutes an admission to the allegations contained in the complaint and may accordingly enter a judgment for payment, or may grant permission to the state's attorney to file a petition pursuant to subdivision 26-7A-10(5). If the child fails to comply with the terms of the judgment, the court may issue a summons to appear and show cause, or assess against the child's parents or guardians the amount of the citation and any restitution owed pursuant to \u00a7 26-7A-129 or may grant permission to the state's attorney to file a petition pursuant to subdivision 26-7A-10(5). Section 10. That \u00a7 26-7A-129 be REPEALED: If a child is found to be in violation of the citation, the court shall enter a judgment against the child for one or more of the following: (1) Require the child to complete a court-approved juvenile diversion program or informal adjustment administered by a court services officer; (2) A fine and court costs not to exceed one hundred dollars; (3) Community service; (4) Restitution as defined in subdivision 23A-28-2(4) and as determined appropriate by the court; or (5) Suspension or revocation of the child's driving privilege if the judgment is entered on a violation pursuant to subdivision 26-7A-126(3). The court may set a hearing to review compliance with the judgment. If a child is unable to pay a fine, court costs, or restitution as ordered by the court, any party may request that the court order community service in lieu of the monetary judgment. At no time may a court order a child to probation or detention upon entry of a judgment on a cited violation. A judgment on a cited violation shall be a confidential matter pursuant to subsection 15-15A-7(p) but the state's attorney may maintain a nonpublic record of the judgment for purposes of determining eligibility under \u00a7 26-7A-127. Section 11. That \u00a7 26-8B-1 be AMENDED: 26-8B-1. It is the purpose of this chapter, in conjunction with chapter 26-7A, to establish an effective state and local system for children in need of supervision, including a focus on community-based rehabilitation. Section 12. That \u00a7 26-8B-4 be AMENDED: 26-8B-4. Following adjudication of a child as a child in need of supervision, the court may continue the case and may require a court services officer to present to the court a plan of disposition. If a community response team as defined in \u00a7 26-8D-1 has been established, prior to any disposition to the Department of Corrections, the court may seek a recommendation for a viable community alternative disposition from the team. If the team is unable to provide any recommendation within seven days of the referral, the court may exercise its discretion and make a disposition decision without the input of the team, pursuant to \u00a7 26-8B-6. In all cases, the court may adopt the recommendation of the team in part, in full, or reject the recommendation of the team in its entirety. Section 13. That \u00a7 26-8B-6 be AMENDED: 26-8B-6. If a child has been adjudicated as a child in need of supervision, the court shall enter a decree of disposition according to the least restrictive alternative available in keeping with the best interests of the child. The decree shall contain one or more of the following: (1) The court may place the child on probation pursuant to \u00a7 26-8B-8 or under protective supervision in the custody of one or both parents, guardian, custodian, relative, or another suitable person under conditions imposed by the court; (2) The court may require as a condition of probation that the child participate in a supervised community service report for assignment to a supervised work program, provided the child is not placed in a detention facility and is not deprived of the schooling that is appropriate to the child's age, needs, and specific rehabilitative goals. The supervised community service work program shall be of a constructive nature designed to promote rehabilitation, shall be appropriate to the age level and physical ability of the child, and shall be combined with counseling by a court services officer or other guidance personnel. The supervised community service program assignment shall be made for a period of time consistent with the child's best interests, but may not exceed ninety days; (3) If the court finds that the child has violated a valid court order, the court may place the child in a detention facility for not more than seven ninety days, including any period of temporary custody pursuant to \u00a7 26-8B-3, for purposes of disposition if: (a) The child is not deprived of the schooling that is appropriate for the child's age, needs, and specific rehabilitative goals; (b) The child had a due process hearing before the order was issued; and (c) A plan of disposition from a court services officer is provided to the court. The issued order must identify the violated court order, determine detention is the best available placement, specify the length of time the child is to be held in detention, and outline the plan for release of the child from detention; (4) The court may commit the child to the Department of Corrections for placement in a juvenile correctional facility, foster home, group home, group care center, residential treatment center, or other community-based services, if those community-based services were not provided prior to commitment, pursuant to chapter 26-11A. Prior to placement in a juvenile correctional facility, an interagency team comprised of representatives from the Department of Human Services, Department of Social Services, Department of Education, the Department of Corrections, and the Unified Judicial System shall make a written finding that placement at a Department of Corrections facility is the least restrictive placement commensurate with the best interests of the child. Subsequent placement in any other Department of Corrections facility may be authorized without an interagency review; (5) The court may require the child to pay restitution, as defined in \u00a7 23A-28-2 and under conditions set by the court if payment can be enforced without serious hardship or injustice to the child; (5)(6) The court may place a child in an alternative educational program; (6)(7) The court may order the child to be examined and treated at the Human Services Center; (7)(8) The court may impose a fine not to exceed five hundred dollars; (8)(9) The court may order the suspension or revocation of the child's right to apply for a driving privilege, suspend or revoke an existing driving privilege, or restrict the privilege in such manner as the court sees fit or as required by \u00a7 32-12-52.4, including requiring that financial responsibility be proved and maintained; or (9)(10) The court may assess or charge the same costs and fees as permitted by \u00a7\u00a7 16-2-41, 23-3-52, 23A-27-26, 23A-28B-42, and 23A-27-27 against the child, parent, guardian, custodian, or other party responsible for the child; or (10) The court may only commit a child to the Department of Corrections if the judge finds that: (a) No viable alternatives exist; (b) The Department of Corrections is the least restrictive alternative; and (c) The court finds from evidence presented at the dispositional hearing or from the pre-dispositional report that the youth presents a significant risk of physical harm to another person. Any finding made pursuant to this section shall be made in the written decree. After disposition, but prior to placement in a juvenile correctional facility, a state interagency team comprised of representatives from the Department of Human Services, the Department of Social Services, the Department of Education, the Department of Corrections, and the Unified Judicial System shall make a written finding that placement at a Department of Corrections facility is the least restrictive placement commensurate with the best interests of the child. Subsequent placement in any other Department of Corrections facility may be authorized without an interagency review. No adjudicated child in need of supervision may be incarcerated in a detention facility except as provided in subdivision (3) or (4) of this section and \u00a7 26-7A-20. Section 14. That \u00a7 26-8B-8 be AMENDED: 26-8B-8. The terms and, conditions, and duration of probation of a child in need of supervision shall be specified by rules or orders of the court and by a court services officer. The duration of juvenile probation shall be specified by order of the court but may not exceed six months unless: (1) The child is placed in the intensive juvenile probation program; or (2) The child's probation is extended as provided under this section. If the child is placed on intensive juvenile probation, the duration of probation ordered by the court may be up to twelve months. If the child is placed on juvenile probation, a court services officer may request two extensions up to six months each or one extension up to six months for intensive juvenile probation. The court may authorize the same in accordance with Unified Judicial System procedure if the extension is necessary for the child to complete evidence-based treatment as required by the case plan. If evidence-based treatment is not available, an extension may be granted if the youth is engaged in alternative court-approved treatment that will not be completed before the previously ordered term of probation expires. The total duration of probation, including juvenile intensive probation and extensions in all cases, may not exceed eighteen months unless the court provides written authorization to allow a child to complete evidence-based treatment that will not be completed before probation expires. Probation may not be extended solely to collect restitution. If probation is terminated with restitution owing, Unified Judicial System procedure may govern the collection. Each child placed on probation shall be given a written statement of the terms and conditions of probation and the probation policy. The terms and conditions, as well as the probation extension policy, shall be explained to the child. The court shall review the terms and conditions of probation and the progress of each child placed on probation at least once every six months. The court may release a child from probation or modify the terms and conditions of the child's probation at any time, but any child who has complied satisfactorily with the terms, conditions, and duration of probation shall be released from probation and the jurisdiction of the court terminated. If the duration of probation previously prescribed has expired, the court shall release the child from probation and terminate jurisdiction. Section 15. That \u00a7 26-8B-9 be AMENDED: 26-8B-9. The following provisions apply if the child is alleged to have violated the terms and conditions of probation and a formal petition is filed with the court: (1) The court shall set a hearing on the alleged violation and shall give five days' notice to the child, to the child's parents, guardian, or custodian, and to any other parties to the proceedings; (2) The child and the child's parents, guardian, or custodian shall be given a written statement concerning the alleged violation; (3) The child may be represented by legal counsel at the probation violation hearing and the child is entitled to the issuance of compulsory process for the attendance of witnesses; (4) If the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the child violated the terms and conditions of probation, the court may modify the terms and conditions of probation, revoke probation, or take other action as permitted by this chapter or chapter 26-7A, according to the least restrictive alternative which is in the best interests of the child and, the public, except commitment to the Department of Corrections. The court may only commit a child to the Department of Corrections if the court finds that the violation committed constitutes a new law violation and finds that the aggravated circumstances provided in subdivision 26-8B-6(10) exist and the state; and (5) For the purposes of this section, a new law violation is defined as delinquent behavior pursuant to \u00a7 26-8C-2, a Class 1 misdemeanor violation of title 32, or a violation of \u00a7 32-23-21; and (6) If the court finds that the child did not violate the terms and conditions of probation as alleged, the court shall dismiss the proceedings and continue the child on probation under the terms, and conditions, and duration previously prescribed. If the duration of probation previously prescribed has expired, the court shall release the child from probation and terminate jurisdiction. Section 16. That \u00a7 26-8C-1 be AMENDED: 26-8C-1. It is the purpose of this chapter, in conjunction with chapter 26-7A, to establish an effective state and local system for delinquent children including a focus on community-based rehabilitation. Section 17. That \u00a7 26-8C-5 be AMENDED: 26-8C-5. Following adjudication of a child as a delinquent child, the court may continue the case and may require a court services officer to present to the court a plan of disposition. Where a community response team as defined in \u00a7 26-8D-1 has been established, prior to any disposition to the Department of Corrections, the court may seek a recommendation for a viable community alternative disposition from the team. If the team is unable to provide any recommendation within seven days of the referral, the disposing court may exercise its discretion and make a disposition decision without the input of the team, pursuant to \u00a7 26-8C-7. In each case, the court may adopt the recommendation of the team in part, in full, or reject the recommendation of the team in its entirety. Section 18. That \u00a7 26-8C-7 be AMENDED: 26-8C-7. If a child has been adjudicated as a delinquent child, the court shall enter a decree of disposition according to the least restrictive alternative available in keeping with the best interests of the child. The decree shall contain one or more of the following: (1) The court may require the child to pay restitution, as defined in subdivision 23A-28-2(4) and under conditions set by the court, if payment can be enforced without serious hardship or injustice to the child; (2) The court may make any one or more of the dispositions in \u00a7 26-8B-6, except that a delinquent child may be incarcerated in a detention facility established pursuant to provisions of chapter 26-7A for not more than ninety days, which may be in addition to any period of temporary custody; (3) The court may impose a fine not to exceed one thousand dollars; (3)(4) The court may place the child on probation under the supervision of a court services officer or another designated individual pursuant to \u00a7 26-8C-14; (4) The court may require a child.

That \u00a7 26-7A-10 be AMENDED: 26-7A-10. If a state's attorney is informed by a law enforcement officer or any other person that a child is, or appears to be, within the purview of this chapter and chapter 26-8A, 26-8B, or 26-8C, the state's attorney shall make a preliminary investigation to determine whether further action shall should be taken. On the basis of the preliminary investigation, the state's attorney may: (1) Decide that no further action is required; (2) If the report relates to an apparent abused or neglected child and if additional information is required, refer the matter to the Department of Social Services for further investigation and recommendations; (3) If the report relates to a juvenile cited violation, proceed on the citation; (4) If the report relates to an apparent child in need of supervision, or an apparent delinquent child, or a juvenile cited violation, refer the matter to a court services officer for any informal adjustment to the supervision of the court that is practicable without a petition or refer the matter to a court-approved juvenile diversion program for any informal action outside the court system that is practicable without the filing of a petition; or (5)(4) File a petition to commence appropriate proceedings in any case that the youth does not meet the criteria provided in \u00a7 26-7A-11.1. Section 4. That \u00a7 26-7A-11 be AMENDED: 26-7A-11. A report of a preliminary investigation involving any apparent child in need of supervision, or any apparent delinquent child, or any juvenile cited violation, may be referred to a court services officer for informal adjustment or to a court-approved juvenile diversion program for informal action pursuant to subdivision 26-7A-10(4) under \u00a7 26-7A-10 only if: (1) The child and the child's parents, guardian, or other custodian were informed of their constitutional and legal rights, including being represented by an attorney at every stage of the proceedings if a petition is filed; (2) The facts are admitted and establish prima facie jurisdiction; and (3) Written consent is obtained from the child's parents, guardian, or custodian and from the child if the child is of sufficient age and understanding. Efforts to effect informal adjustment or informal action may extend no longer than four six months from the date of the consent. The state's attorney may include in the referral to a court-approved juvenile diversion program a requirement that restitution as defined in subdivision 23A-28-2(4) be imposed as a condition of the diversion program. Section 5. That \u00a7 26-7A-11.1 be REPEALED: Any apparent child in need of supervision or any apparent delinquent child shall be referred for informal adjustment or informal action pursuant to subdivision 26-7A-10(4) if the following criteria are met: (1) The child has no prior adjudications; (2) The child has had no informal adjustment or informal action within the last twelve months; (3) The child is an apparent child in need of supervision pursuant to \u00a7 26-8B-2 or an apparent delinquent pursuant to \u00a7 26-8C-2 and the alleged conduct constitutes a misdemeanor; (4) The child's alleged conduct did not include use of violence or force against another; and (5) All of the requirements in \u00a7 26-7A-11 are met. If the state's attorney has good cause to believe that informal adjustment or informal action is insufficient to meet the purposes of this chapter and chapters 26-8B and 26-8C, the state's attorney may file a delinquency or child in need of supervision petition pursuant to subdivision 26-7A-10(5). The petition shall include notice of the departure from informal adjustment or informal action and notice to the child of the child's right to move for informal adjustment or informal action. Upon motion of the child and upon a finding that no good cause exists, the court may refer the child to informal adjustment or informal action pursuant to subdivision 26-7A-10(4). Section 6. That \u00a7 26-7A-125 be REPEALED: The Supreme Court shall establish rules, pursuant to \u00a7 16-3-1, to develop a graduated sanctions and incentives procedure and grid to guide court services officers in determining the appropriate response to a violation of terms or conditions of probation in juvenile cases. If the graduated sanctions program includes detention, a stay may not exceed forty-eight hours, and may not exceed twenty-four hours for children in need of supervision pursuant to \u00a7 26-8B-3. The Unified Judicial System shall collect data related to the use of sanctions, grid compliance and program outcomes, and shall include a process for reviewing sanctions that are challenged by the juvenile. The system of graduated sanctions shall be created with the following objectives: (1) Responding to violations of probation quickly, consistently, and proportionally; (2) Reducing the time and resources expended by the court to respond to violations; and (3) Reducing the likelihood of a new delinquent act. Section 7. That \u00a7 26-7A-126 be REPEALED: The following allegations of delinquency and children in need of supervision shall be treated as juvenile cited violations by law enforcement: (1) Petty theft in the second degree pursuant to \u00a7 22-30A-17.3; (2) Intentional damage to property, four hundred dollars or less, pursuant to \u00a7 22-34-1; (3) Purchase, possession, or consumption of alcoholic beverage by person under twenty-one years pursuant to \u00a7 35-9-2 in accordance with subdivision 26-8B-2(5); and (4) Truancy pursuant to subdivision 26-8B-2(1). The issuing officer shall notify the child and the child's parent, guardian, or custodian that a hearing on the citation for a cited violation shall be held before a judicial circuit court judge within ten days of issuance of the citation or on the next available court date and be treated as a confidential juvenile matter. The hearing shall be held pursuant to \u00a7 26-7A-36 and the case records shall be treated as confidential consistent with the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 26-7A-114, 26-7A-115, 26-7A-116, 26-7A-120, and 26-7A-27. A cited violation is not an adjudication or a child in need of supervision or delinquency proceeding. In lieu of a citation, pursuant to subdivision 26-7A-126(4), a school official may file a report with the state's attorney. A report may also be filed with the state's attorney in lieu of a citation if the conduct occurs in conjunction with another offense that is not subject to the juvenile cited violation process. Section 8. That \u00a7 26-7A-127 be REPEALED: If a state's attorney is informed that a citation or report has been issued for a juvenile cited violation, the state's attorney may take any action permitted pursuant to \u00a7 26-7A-10, except that a state's attorney may only file a petition pursuant to subdivision 26-7A-10(5) if: (1) The child is cited or a report is filed pursuant to subdivision 26-7A-126(1), (2), or (4); or (2) The child is cited pursuant to subdivision 26-7A-126(3), and has two or more prior judgments for the same violation. If the state's attorney intends to proceed on a petition for a violation of the provisions in \u00a7 26-7A-126 pursuant to subdivision (1) or (2) in this section, the provisions of \u00a7 26-7A-11.1 apply. Section 9. That \u00a7 26-7A-128 be REPEALED: If the state's attorney elects to proceed on the citation pursuant to subdivision 26-7A-10(3), the child shall be asked for an admission or denial of the alleged violation. If the child admits to the violation, the court shall accept the admission and enter a judgment pursuant to \u00a7 26-7A-129. If the child denies committing the violation, the case may be tried according to procedure adopted by the presiding judge of each judicial circuit and approved by the Supreme Court, but a jury trial may not be granted. If the child fails to appear in court at the time set in the citation or set by subsequent postponement, the court may either issue a summons to appear and set a new date for hearing to show cause, the court may consider that failure to appear constitutes an admission to the allegations contained in the complaint and may accordingly enter a judgment for payment, or may grant permission to the state's attorney to file a petition pursuant to subdivision 26-7A-10(5). If the child fails to comply with the terms of the judgment, the court may issue a summons to appear and show cause, or assess against the child's parents or guardians the amount of the citation and any restitution owed pursuant to \u00a7 26-7A-129 or may grant permission to the state's attorney to file a petition pursuant to subdivision 26-7A-10(5). Section 10. That \u00a7 26-7A-129 be REPEALED: If a child is found to be in violation of the citation, the court shall enter a judgment against the child for one or more of the following: (1) Require the child to complete a court-approved juvenile diversion program or informal adjustment administered by a court services officer; (2) A fine and court costs not to exceed one hundred dollars; (3) Community service; (4) Restitution as defined in subdivision 23A-28-2(4) and as determined appropriate by the court; or (5) Suspension or revocation of the child's driving privilege if the judgment is entered on a violation pursuant to subdivision 26-7A-126(3). The court may set a hearing to review compliance with the judgment. If a child is unable to pay a fine, court costs, or restitution as ordered by the court, any party may request that the court order community service in lieu of the monetary judgment. At no time may a court order a child to probation or detention upon entry of a judgment on a cited violation. A judgment on a cited violation shall be a confidential matter pursuant to subsection 15-15A-7(p) but the state's attorney may maintain a nonpublic record of the judgment for purposes of determining eligibility under \u00a7 26-7A-127. Section 11. That \u00a7 26-8B-1 be AMENDED: 26-8B-1. It is the purpose of this chapter, in conjunction with chapter 26-7A, to establish an effective state and local system for children in need of supervision, including a focus on community-based rehabilitation. Section 12. That \u00a7 26-8B-4 be AMENDED: 26-8B-4. Following adjudication of a child as a child in need of supervision, the court may continue the case and may require a court services officer to present to the court a plan of disposition. If a community response team as defined in \u00a7 26-8D-1 has been established, prior to any disposition to the Department of Corrections, the court may seek a recommendation for a viable community alternative disposition from the team. If the team is unable to provide any recommendation within seven days of the referral, the court may exercise its discretion and make a disposition decision without the input of the team, pursuant to \u00a7 26-8B-6. In all cases, the court may adopt the recommendation of the team in part, in full, or reject the recommendation of the team in its entirety. Section 13. That \u00a7 26-8B-6 be AMENDED: 26-8B-6. If a child has been adjudicated as a child in need of supervision, the court shall enter a decree of disposition according to the least restrictive alternative available in keeping with the best interests of the child. The decree shall contain one or more of the following: (1) The court may place the child on probation pursuant to \u00a7 26-8B-8 or under protective supervision in the custody of one or both parents, guardian, custodian, relative, or another suitable person under conditions imposed by the court; (2) The court may require as a condition of probation that the child participate in a supervised community service report for assignment to a supervised work program, provided the child is not placed in a detention facility and is not deprived of the schooling that is appropriate to the child's age, needs, and specific rehabilitative goals. The supervised community service work program shall be of a constructive nature designed to promote rehabilitation, shall be appropriate to the age level and physical ability of the child, and shall be combined with counseling by a court services officer or other guidance personnel. The supervised community service program assignment shall be made for a period of time consistent with the child's best interests, but may not exceed ninety days; (3) If the court finds that the child has violated a valid court order, the court may place the child in a detention facility for not more than seven ninety days, including any period of temporary custody pursuant to \u00a7 26-8B-3, for purposes of disposition if: (a) The child is not deprived of the schooling that is appropriate for the child's age, needs, and specific rehabilitative goals; (b) The child had a due process hearing before the order was issued; and (c) A plan of disposition from a court services officer is provided to the court. The issued order must identify the violated court order, determine detention is the best available placement, specify the length of time the child is to be held in detention, and outline the plan for release of the child from detention; (4) The court may commit the child to the Department of Corrections for placement in a juvenile correctional facility, foster home, group home, group care center, residential treatment center, or other community-based services, if those community-based services were not provided prior to commitment, pursuant to chapter 26-11A. Prior to placement in a juvenile correctional facility, an interagency team comprised of representatives from the Department of Human Services, Department of Social Services, Department of Education, the Department of Corrections, and the Unified Judicial System shall make a written finding that placement at a Department of Corrections facility is the least restrictive placement commensurate with the best interests of the child. Subsequent placement in any other Department of Corrections facility may be authorized without an interagency review; (5) The court may require the child to pay restitution, as defined in \u00a7 23A-28-2 and under conditions set by the court if payment can be enforced without serious hardship or injustice to the child; (5)(6) The court may place a child in an alternative educational program; (6)(7) The court may order the child to be examined and treated at the Human Services Center; (7)(8) The court may impose a fine not to exceed five hundred dollars; (8)(9) The court may order the suspension or revocation of the child's right to apply for a driving privilege, suspend or revoke an existing driving privilege, or restrict the privilege in such manner as the court sees fit or as required by \u00a7 32-12-52.4, including requiring that financial responsibility be proved and maintained; or (9)(10) The court may assess or charge the same costs and fees as permitted by \u00a7\u00a7 16-2-41, 23-3-52, 23A-27-26, 23A-28B-42, and 23A-27-27 against the child, parent, guardian, custodian, or other party responsible for the child; or (10) The court may only commit a child to the Department of Corrections if the judge finds that: (a) No viable alternatives exist; (b) The Department of Corrections is the least restrictive alternative; and (c) The court finds from evidence presented at the dispositional hearing or from the pre-dispositional report that the youth presents a significant risk of physical harm to another person. Any finding made pursuant to this section shall be made in the written decree. After disposition, but prior to placement in a juvenile correctional facility, a state interagency team comprised of representatives from the Department of Human Services, the Department of Social Services, the Department of Education, the Department of Corrections, and the Unified Judicial System shall make a written finding that placement at a Department of Corrections facility is the least restrictive placement commensurate with the best interests of the child. Subsequent placement in any other Department of Corrections facility may be authorized without an interagency review. No adjudicated child in need of supervision may be incarcerated in a detention facility except as provided in subdivision (3) or (4) of this section and \u00a7 26-7A-20. Section 14. That \u00a7 26-8B-8 be AMENDED: 26-8B-8. The terms and, conditions, and duration of probation of a child in need of supervision shall be specified by rules or orders of the court and by a court services officer. The duration of juvenile probation shall be specified by order of the court but may not exceed six months unless: (1) The child is placed in the intensive juvenile probation program; or (2) The child's probation is extended as provided under this section. If the child is placed on intensive juvenile probation, the duration of probation ordered by the court may be up to twelve months. If the child is placed on juvenile probation, a court services officer may request two extensions up to six months each or one extension up to six months for intensive juvenile probation. The court may authorize the same in accordance with Unified Judicial System procedure if the extension is necessary for the child to complete evidence-based treatment as required by the case plan. If evidence-based treatment is not available, an extension may be granted if the youth is engaged in alternative court-approved treatment that will not be completed before the previously ordered term of probation expires. The total duration of probation, including juvenile intensive probation and extensions in all cases, may not exceed eighteen months unless the court provides written authorization to allow a child to complete evidence-based treatment that will not be completed before probation expires. Probation may not be extended solely to collect restitution. If probation is terminated with restitution owing, Unified Judicial System procedure may govern the collection. Each child placed on probation shall be given a written statement of the terms and conditions of probation and the probation policy. The terms and conditions, as well as the probation extension policy, shall be explained to the child. The court shall review the terms and conditions of probation and the progress of each child placed on probation at least once every six months. The court may release a child from probation or modify the terms and conditions of the child's probation at any time, but any child who has complied satisfactorily with the terms, conditions, and duration of probation shall be released from probation and the jurisdiction of the court terminated. If the duration of probation previously prescribed has expired, the court shall release the child from probation and terminate jurisdiction. Section 15. That \u00a7 26-8B-9 be AMENDED: 26-8B-9. The following provisions apply if the child is alleged to have violated the terms and conditions of probation and a formal petition is filed with the court: (1) The court shall set a hearing on the alleged violation and shall give five days' notice to the child, to the child's parents, guardian, or custodian, and to any other parties to the proceedings; (2) The child and the child's parents, guardian, or custodian shall be given a written statement concerning the alleged violation; (3) The child may be represented by legal counsel at the probation violation hearing and the child is entitled to the issuance of compulsory process for the attendance of witnesses; (4) If the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the child violated the terms and conditions of probation, the court may modify the terms and conditions of probation, revoke probation, or take other action as permitted by this chapter or chapter 26-7A, according to the least restrictive alternative which is in the best interests of the child and, the public, except commitment to the Department of Corrections. The court may only commit a child to the Department of Corrections if the court finds that the violation committed constitutes a new law violation and finds that the aggravated circumstances provided in subdivision 26-8B-6(10) exist and the state; and (5) For the purposes of this section, a new law violation is defined as delinquent behavior pursuant to \u00a7 26-8C-2, a Class 1 misdemeanor violation of title 32, or a violation of \u00a7 32-23-21; and (6) If the court finds that the child did not violate the terms and conditions of probation as alleged, the court shall dismiss the proceedings and continue the child on probation under the terms, and conditions, and duration previously prescribed.

Where a community response team as defined in \u00a7 26-8D-1 has been established, prior to any disposition to the Department of Corrections, the court may seek a recommendation for a viable community alternative disposition from the team. If the team is unable to provide any recommendation within seven days of the referral, the disposing court may exercise its discretion and make a disposition decision without the input of the team, pursuant to \u00a7 26-8C-7. In each case, the court may adopt the recommendation of the team in part, in full, or reject the recommendation of the team in its entirety. Section 18. That \u00a7 26-8C-7 be AMENDED: 26-8C-7.

Each recipient and the recipient's officers, agents, and employees are immune from any cause of action for civil damages brought by the child, parents, guardians, or any third party if the cause of action arises from any act of commission or omission by the recipient or any of its officers, agents, or employees or any act of commission or omission by the child and the acts arise out of or are in connection with a community service program, except if the cause of action is the result of gross negligence or willful and wanton misconduct of the recipient or its officers, agents, or employees and except to the extent that the recipient has purchased liability insurance. Nothing in this section relieves any individual child from responsibility for the child's individual acts. Section 34. That \u00a7 26-8D-14 be REPEALED: If a judge orders more than fourteen days of detention in a thirty-day period pursuant to \u00a7 26-8C-7 or 26-8B-6, the court shall enter findings of fact and conclusions of law to include in the dispositional decree justifying the need for extended detention.

Section 37. That \u00a7 26-8D-17 be REPEALED: The Department of Corrections, pursuant to the provisions of chapter 26-11A and \u00a7 26-8C-7 or 26-8B-6, may place a child in a group care center operated and maintained by a nonstate entity only in accordance with a performance-based reimbursement rate structure as provided in the provider contract and as provided by this section. If a provider is able to substantially accomplish the treatment goals and release a child from group care within the performance expectation period, a performance-based reimbursement payment shall be included in the payment allocation. The maximum performance-based reimbursement payment shall be allocated when a provider is able to substantially accomplish the treatment goals and release a child within three months. A diminished performance-based reimbursement payment shall be allocated when a provider is able to substantially accomplish the treatment goals and release a child in more than three months but less than four months. The performance-based reimbursement payment is in addition to the provider reimbursement rate as established by the Department of Social Services. The Department of Corrections shall determine the need for placement in a group care facility upon admission and review the placement monthly thereafter. Upon finding that the child is no longer in need of placement, the child shall be released to aftercare pursuant to \u00a7 26-11A-12. If the child cannot be released to aftercare at no fault of the provider, a performance-based reimbursement payment shall be added to the payment allocation as long as the provider otherwise qualifies for that payment. If a provider terminates a child prior to substantial completion of the treatment goals and the Department of Corrections transfers the child to another facility, the transferring provider does not qualify for a performance-based payment under this section for that child. Juvenile corrections facilities maintained and operated by the Department of Corrections shall design and operate programs to achieve substantial accomplishment of treatment goals and the release to aftercare within three months. Specialized transition services are exempt from the performance-based reimbursement rate structure. After January 1, 2019, the Department of Corrections may promulgate rules, pursuant to chapter 1-26, to continue or create additional or alternative performance-based reimbursement period timeframes. Section 38. That \u00a7 26-8D-18 be REPEALED: The Department of Corrections, pursuant to the provisions of chapter 26-11A and \u00a7 26-8C-7 or 26-8B-6, may place a child in a residential treatment center or intensive residential treatment center only in accordance with a performance-based reimbursement rate structure as provided in the provider contract and provided by this section. If a provider is able to substantially accomplish the treatment goals and release a child from residential or intensive residential treatment within the performance expectation period, a performance-based reimbursement payment shall be added to the payment allocation. For those providers that substantially meet the treatment goals and release within three months, a maximum performance-based reimbursement payment shall be added to the payment allocation. For those providers that substantially meet the treatment goals and release within five, seven, or nine months, a diminished performance-based reimbursement payment, which decreases as length of stay increases, shall be added to the payment allocation. The provider contracts shall provide how the Department of Corrections may use state general fund dollars in the performance expectation allocation. The performance-based reimbursement payment is in addition to the provider reimbursement rate as established by the Department of Social Services. The Department of Corrections shall evaluate monthly the need for continued placement in a residential treatment center or intensive residential treatment center. Upon a finding that the child is no longer in need of placement, the child shall be released to aftercare pursuant to \u00a7 26-11A-12 or specialized transition services. If the child cannot be released to aftercare at no fault of the provider, a performance-based reimbursement payment shall be added to the payment allocation as long as the provider otherwise qualifies for that payment. If a provider terminates a child prior to substantial completion of the treatment goals and the Department of Corrections transfers the child to another facility, the transferring provider does not qualify for additional performance-based reimbursement payment under this section for that child. After January 1, 2019, the Department of Corrections may promulgate rules, pursuant to chapter 1-26, to continue or create additional or alternative performance-based reimbursement period timeframes. Section 39. That \u00a7 26-8D-19 be REPEALED: The Department of Corrections shall report semiannually to the oversight council the number of children committed, number of recommitments, the average length of stay in residential placement in total and by provider, and average length of commitment among children discharged from the Department of Corrections.

Section 41. That \u00a7 26-8D-21 be REPEALED: The juvenile justice detention cost-sharing fund is hereby created in the Department of Corrections for the purpose of assisting counties with increased costs due to increased juvenile detention expenses paid by counties. Section 42. That \u00a7 26-8D-22 be REPEALED: Any county that provides the Department of Corrections with documentation showing juvenile detention bed days paid by the county for calendar years 2013, 2014, and 2015 by March 1, 2016, is considered a participating county. All other counties are nonparticipating counties. A nonparticipating county may become a participating county in subsequent years by submitting the data in this section and complying with the requirements in \u00a7 26-8D-23. Section 43. That \u00a7 26-8D-23 be REPEALED: Beginning on March 1, 2017, and March first of each year thereafter, each participating county shall submit to the Department of Corrections the number of juvenile detention bed days paid by the county in the preceding calendar year. Only a participating county is eligible for reimbursement from the juvenile justice detention cost-sharing fund. The participating counties shall be determined on an annual basis. Section 44. That \u00a7 26-8D-24 be REPEALED: The Department of Corrections shall compare the number of detention bed days each county paid in the preceding calendar year to the average number of detention bed days paid in calendar years 2013, 2014, and 2015. If the days paid in the calendar year in question exceed the average, the Department of Corrections shall pay the county two hundred dollars per day for each day exceeding the average. If the amount owed the participating counties exceeds the amount of money in the fund, the amount reimbursed per bed day shall be prorated to fulfill all requests. Section 45. That \u00a7 26-11A-8.1 be REPEALED: For any child in the custody of the Department of Corrections and placed in a residential facility, state-run or private, the department shall participate in a monthly treatment team meeting with the residential facility. The department shall: (1) Review progress on the treatment plan goals and evaluate the effectiveness of the service; (2) Determine whether any less restrictive treatment alternative is appropriate and available; and (3) Develop an aftercare plan designed to facilitate release that identifies release options and timeframes, if appropriate. Each treatment plan shall be designed to achieve release at the earliest possible time and to maximize the child's development and acquisition of skills that enables the child to successfully transition to community living. The Department of Corrections shall train department staff on effective participation in treatment team meetings. Section 46. That \u00a7 26-11A-15 be AMENDED: 26-11A-15. If the independent hearing officer finds probable cause that the terms and conditions of aftercare have been violated by committing an act subject to transfer proceedings pursuant to \u00a7 26-11-3.1, a crime of violence pursuant to subdivision 22-1-2(9), sex offense pursuant to \u00a7 22-24B-1, felony sexual registry offense pursuant to chapter 22-24B, or burglary in the second degree pursuant to \u00a7 22-32-3; or that the juvenile presents a significant risk of physical harm to another person and has committed a new law violation, an aftercare revocation hearing shall be held before a member of the Board of Pardons and Paroles created in \u00a7 24-13-1 within thirty days of the temporary detention or shelter hearing. For the purposes of this section, a new law violation is defined as delinquent behavior pursuant to \u00a7 26-8C-2, a Class 1 misdemeanor violation of title 32, or a violation of \u00a7 32-23-21. The juvenile, with the consent of a parent, guardian, or custodian, has the right to waive this hearing at any time after the juvenile is detained and after advisement that waiver of the right to appear before the Board of Pardons and Paroles may result in the juvenile being returned to placement. If the hearing officer does not find probable cause that the terms and conditions of aftercare have been violated by committing an act subject to transfer proceedings pursuant to \u00a7 26-11-3.1, a crime of violence pursuant to subdivision 22-1-2(9), sex offense pursuant to \u00a7 22-24B-1, felony sexual registry offense pursuant to chapter 22-24B, or burglary in the second degree pursuant to \u00a7 22-32-3; or that the juvenile presents a significant and likely risk of physical harm to another person and has committed a new law violation, the juvenile shall be returned to aftercare or released. The member of the board shall set the aftercare revocation hearing and shall give five days notice to the juvenile, to the juvenile's parents, guardian, or custodian, and to any other parties to the hearing. The juvenile and the juvenile's parents, guardian, or custodian, shall be given a written statement of the allegations against the juvenile. The juvenile shall have the opportunity to appear in person, present witnesses, or documentary evidence in the juvenile's behalf, and cross-examine witnesses unless the member of the board makes a written determination that doing so is not in the best interests of the juvenile. The juvenile may be represented by legal counsel at the hearing. Section 47. Sections 2 to 46, inclusive, of this Act are effective on July 1, 2023."}, {"bill_id": 23437, "bill_version_id": 235797, "bill_version": "House State Affairs Engrossed", "bill_version_date": "2022-03-03T16:11:39.657-06:00", "bill_text": "An Act to establish an interim committee regarding alternatives for placement of juvenile offenders.
