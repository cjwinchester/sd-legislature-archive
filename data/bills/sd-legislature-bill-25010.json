The department shall administer the fund and maintain separate accounts for each project. The secretary shall approve vouchers and the state auditor shall draw warrants to pay administrative costs and extraordinary expenses in accordance with this chapter. All money received by the department for the fund must be set forth in an informational budget pursuant to \u00a7 4-7-7.2 and be annually reviewed by the Legislature. Section 3. That a NEW SECTION be added to title 34A: The state or a political subdivision may submit a claim for an extraordinary expense to the director for disbursement from the fund in accordance with this chapter. Each claim under this section must be accompanied by a statement of the basis on which it is made, and true and accurate records and books of account regarding the extraordinary expense claimed, including copies of checks, vouchers, warrants, sales receipts, invoices, billings, payroll records, or similar documents for each extraordinary expense in sufficient detail to allow the director to reasonably review the claim. The state or a political subdivision receiving a disbursement from the fund for an approved claim under this section shall keep and maintain true and accurate records and books of account consistent with government accounting standards and in the same manner and for the same period as required by law and make them available for inspection by the director and a duly authorized representative of the pipeline company. On or before the first of February of each year, the director shall provide statements of claim activities for the preceding calendar year to the secretary, any applicable political subdivision, and the pipeline company.

That a NEW SECTION be added to title 34A: The state or a political subdivision may submit a request for pre-approval of an anticipated claim for extraordinary expense to the fund in accordance with this chapter. Each request for pre-approval submitted under this section must be accompanied by a statement of the basis on which the request is made and a description of the anticipated extraordinary expense in sufficient detail to allow the director to reasonably review the request. If a request submitted under this section is approved, the state or political subdivision must provide the director with the same documentation, as required for a claim submitted under section 3 of this Act, after the extraordinary expense is incurred. The director shall review the documents provided under this section to determine whether the expenditure is consistent with the pre-approval decision and issue an action notice regarding the director's determination. Section 5. That a NEW SECTION be added to title 34A: The director shall approve or deny, in whole or in part, any claim submitted under section 3 of this Act or any request submitted under section 4 of this Act. The director may condition any claim for extraordinary expense at the director's discretion.

An action notice may be accompanied by the records submitted in accordance with sections 3 and 4 of this Act. A claim submitted by the state or a political subdivision is not payable from the fund until the claim is approved by the director. The director shall authorize disbursements from the fund for payment of an approved claim to the state or a political subdivision within forty-five days from the date of the action notice. Section 6. That a NEW SECTION be added to title 34A: A claim under section 3 of this Act may be submitted to the director only after the project commencement date. A request under section 4 of this Act may be submitted on or after April 1, 2024.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the director may not approve any extraordinary expense claim that is not, or any request for pre-approval that will not be, incurred within one year after the project completion date, subject to section 16 of this Act. Section 7. That a NEW SECTION be added to title 34A: The department shall communicate with the pipeline company to review any claim or request for pre-approval made to the fund under sections 3 or 4 of this Act. A pipeline company shall designate in writing three official representatives who are authorized to coordinate with the department. Any official representative's concurrence with the director's action notice approving a claim is a waiver of the right of that pipeline company to contest the action notice and is a waiver of the informal review process by the secretary. Section 8. That a NEW SECTION be added to title 34A: If the state or a political subdivision receives payment from the fund for an extraordinary expense, and subsequently receives reimbursement through restitution, judgment, settlement, contribution, or other funding for the expense from any other source, except civil recoveries, the reimbursement must be deposited into the fund.

Any reimbursement from federal sources or civil recoveries must be deposited only as allocated by the secretary. For the purposes of this section, the term \"special fee\" means a fee billed to and paid by a pipeline company to defray administrative costs and extraordinary expenses. Section 9. That a NEW SECTION be added to title 34A: A pipeline company that disputes the approval or denial, in whole or in part, of a claim under section 5 of this Act may, within ten days of the date of the action notice, submit its objection in good faith, together with a statement of the basis for the objection, and request a review from the secretary. The secretary shall make an expeditious review of the director's action notice and may approve, modify, condition, or deny the claim, in whole or in part. The secretary's review must be exhausted before any appeal to the Office of Hearing Examiners. A pipeline company may appeal the secretary's decision, if the pipeline company has properly preserved its appeal, by giving written notice to the secretary within ten days of the date of the secretary's decision. The pipeline company may commence one administrative appeal annually arising out of all decisions, joined for judicial efficiency, dated during the preceding calendar year from which the pipeline company wishes to appeal. The pipeline company shall file a written notice of appeal with the Office of Hearing Examiners. Copies of the written notice must be served on the secretary and any other interested party no later than the first of March or the appeal is barred. A written notice of appeal must identify each disputed and properly preserved claim with a decision in the prior calendar year. An appeal under this section must be conducted by a hearing examiner in accordance with chapter 1-26D. The hearing examiner, after hearing the evidence, shall make proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, and issue a proposed decision. The secretary shall accept, reject, or modify the hearing examiner's findings, conclusions, and decision, which then constitutes the final agency decision. Alternatively, the secretary may appoint the hearing examiner to make the final agency decision. The secretary may arrange for assistance from private counsel throughout the administrative appeal process. The final agency decision may be appealed to circuit court in accordance with chapter 1-26. A pipeline company has standing to appeal under this section. The appeal under this section is the exclusive remedy of a pipeline company regarding the disbursement of a claim of extraordinary expense and constitutes a limited express waiver of sovereign immunity only to the extent necessary under this section. The venue for any disputed claim and appeal under this section is in state circuit court in Hughes County. Pre-judgment interest shall accrue from the date of the secretary's final decision on all disputed claims at the Category B rate of interest specified in \u00a7 54-3-16. Section 10. That a NEW SECTION be added to title 34A: Within twenty days of a project commencement date, the pipeline company shall make a deposit to the fund of four million dollars.

Section 11. That a NEW SECTION be added to title 34A: The secretary may instruct the director to: (1) Withhold, delay, suspend, or reduce any monthly billing to a pipeline company, if the secretary has cause to anticipate the receipt of an additional deposit from a source other than a pipeline company; or (2) For good cause shown, review any claim that is submitted to the director more than forty-five days from the date the extraordinary expense was incurred. Section 12. That a NEW SECTION be added to title 34A: Nothing in this Act prevents the state and a pipeline company from entering into any contract or other agreement, provided the terms of the contract or agreement are not inconsistent with this chapter. Section 13. That a NEW SECTION be added to title 34A: The secretary may promulgate rules in accordance with chapter 1-26 to implement the provisions of sections 1 to 14, inclusive, of this Act. Section 14. That a NEW SECTION be added to title 34A: Sections 1 to 14, inclusive, of this Act are to be repealed October 1, 2026. All claims must be submitted by that date.
