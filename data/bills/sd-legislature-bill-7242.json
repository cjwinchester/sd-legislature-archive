BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That the code be amended by adding a NEW SECTION to read: An employer shall make reasonable accommodations for any employee related to pregnancy, childbirth, or a related condition. The term, reasonable accommodations, includes more frequent or longer breaks, time off to recover from childbirth, adjustment of seating, temporary transfer to a less strenuous or hazardous position, job restructuring, private nonbathroom space for breastfeeding, assistance with manual labor, modified work schedules, or any other reasonable request directly related to pregnancy, childbirth, or a related condition. The employer shall engage in a timely and good faith process with the employee to determine effective accommodations. However, no employer is required by this Act to create additional employment, unless the employer does so for other classes of employees that need accommodation. Additionally, no employer is required to discharge any employee, transfer any employee with more seniority, or promote an unqualified employee for purposes of the accommodation. Section 2. That the code be amended by adding a NEW SECTION to read: No employer may take adverse action against an employee who requests or uses a reasonable accommodation related to pregnancy, childbirth, or a related condition, or deny employment opportunities to an otherwise qualified employee if the denial is based on the need of the employer to make reasonable accommodations for the employee. If another reasonable accommodation can be provided, no employer may force an employee to take vacation or unpaid leave, or to accept an accommodation if the employee chooses not to accept it."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 7242, "action_date": "2016-01-28T13:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 38415, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/38415.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 214, "committee_id_action": 325, "committee_id_assigned": 310, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 7242, "action_date": "2016-02-19T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 39450, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/39450.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 310, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 7242, "action_date": "2016-02-19T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 39649, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/39649.pdf", "status_text": "Motion to amend", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 310, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 7242, "action_date": "2016-02-19T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 39649, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/39649.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to the 41st legislative day", "journal_page": 465, "committee_id_action": 310, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 21159, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [1063, 1056, 968, 1023, 1069, 1051, 965, 1053, 1064, 1052, 1034], "Nay": [1002, 982]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/7242"}
