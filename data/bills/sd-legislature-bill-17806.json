BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 32-12-12 be amended to read as follows: 32-12-12. A restricted minor's permit may be issued, upon application and payment of the proper fees as provided in \u00a7 32-12-16, to a minor at least fourteen years of age but less than eighteen years of age who has successfully passed all applicable tests and completed the requirements of an instruction permit as provided in \u00a7 32-12-11 or 32-12-11.1 and has not been convicted of a traffic violation during the past six months. For any such minor who has successfully completed a driver education course that has been approved by the Department of Education and Cultural Affairs or a driver education course that the secretary of commerce and regulation has determined has been approved by a state government agency in another state, the required minimum time period for holding the instruction permit in order to qualify for the restricted minor's permit is ninety continuous days. A restricted minor's permit entitles the holder, while having the permit in immediate physical possession, to operate a motor vehicle during the hours of 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. standard time if the motor vehicle is being operated with the permission of the holder's parents or guardian and during the hours of 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. if the motor vehicle is being operated under the direction of the holder's parent or guardian who is occupying a seat beside the holder. A restricted minor's permit holder is entitled to operate a motor vehicle during the hours of 8 p.m. to 11 p.m. standard time if the motor vehicle is being operated with the permission of the holder's parents or guardian and the holder is taking the most direct route home from school or work. The restrictions as to time of operation and operation under the direction of a parent or guardian do not apply to the holder of a valid restricted minor's permit operating a self-propelled agricultural machine which is not subject to registration under chapter 32-5."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 17806, "action_date": "2003-01-29T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 96046, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/96046.pdf", "status_text": "First read in Senate and referred to", "journal_page": 231, "committee_id_action": 799, "committee_id_assigned": 783, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 17806, "action_date": "2003-02-04T08:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 96498, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/96498.pdf", "status_text": "Hog Housed", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 783, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 17806, "action_date": "2003-02-04T08:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 96498, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/96498.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 783, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 17806, "action_date": "2003-02-06T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 96686, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/96686.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass Amended,", "journal_page": 346, "committee_id_action": 783, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 56153, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [2832, 2834, 2878, 2881, 2903, 2897, 2935]}}, {"bill_id": 17806, "action_date": "2003-02-06T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 96686, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/96686.pdf", "status_text": "Place on Consent Calendar", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 783, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 17806, "action_date": "2003-02-06T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 96686, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/96686.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 783, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 17806, "action_date": "2003-02-10T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 96908, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/96908.pdf", "status_text": "Remove from Consent Calendar", "journal_page": 387, "committee_id_action": 799, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 17806, "action_date": "2003-02-11T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 97002, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/97002.pdf", "status_text": "Motion to Amend,", "journal_page": 408, "committee_id_action": 799, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 17806, "action_date": "2003-02-13T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 97182, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/97182.pdf", "status_text": "Motion to Amend,", "journal_page": 449, "committee_id_action": 799, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 17806, "action_date": "2003-02-13T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 97182, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/97182.pdf", "status_text": "Tabled amendment", "journal_page": 451, "committee_id_action": 799, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 54553, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [2832, 2840, 2847, 2849, 2853, 2856, 2868, 2878, 2882, 2886, 2935], "Yea": [2834, 2838, 2850, 2851, 2852, 2854, 2865, 2876, 2880, 2881, 2883, 2887, 2891, 2897, 2901, 2903, 2904, 2908, 2916, 2921, 2926, 2927, 2928], "Excused": [2835]}}, {"bill_id": 17806, "action_date": "2003-02-13T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 97182, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/97182.pdf", "status_text": "Motion to Amend,", "journal_page": 452, "committee_id_action": 799, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 17806, "action_date": "2003-02-13T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 97182, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/97182.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass Amended,", "journal_page": 452, "committee_id_action": 799, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "F", "vote": {"vote_id": 54554, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [2832, 2847, 2849, 2853, 2856, 2865, 2868, 2878, 2882, 2883, 2886, 2897, 2901, 2908, 2916, 2921, 2926, 2927, 2928], "Yea": [2834, 2838, 2840, 2850, 2851, 2852, 2854, 2876, 2880, 2881, 2887, 2891, 2903, 2904, 2935], "Excused": [2835]}}]}
