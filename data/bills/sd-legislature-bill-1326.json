WHEREAS, there are currently no horse processing facilities in operation in the United States, and federal legislation was introduced to prohibit the transport or sale of horses and other equines for slaughter or processing; and WHEREAS, the equine industry faces an unprecedented crisis as thousands of unwanted horses are exposed to abandonment and neglect because of the cessation of horse slaughter in the United States, and efforts to prohibit the transport and export of horses for slaughter only exacerbate this problem; and WHEREAS, there is a critical need for humane horse processing facilities in the United States. The nation's overburdened horse rescue and adoption facilities cannot begin to handle the influx of additional abandoned horses each year that results from the cessation of equine slaughter, processing, and transport activity; and WHEREAS, in the United States, the harvest of animals under federal inspection is highly regulated to provide for humane handling of the animals and for a safe and wholesome product. Horse processing in the United States was the most tightly regulated of any animal harvest. Horse processing facilities cannot be established in the United States unless federal inspection for such facilities is reinstated; and WHEREAS, the North Dakota Legislature is currently considering HB 1496 to authorize and fund a feasibility study for an equine processing facility to meet the needs of the equine industry in the current crisis; and WHEREAS, the Illinois Legislature is considering HB 0583 to reinstate certain inspection and regulation activity related to horse slaughter and processing facilities as well as other provisions to facilitate the resumption of such activity in Illinois; and WHEREAS, the Montana Legislature is considering HB 418, a measure to encourage private horse slaughter plant development. The bill would prohibit state courts from granting injunctions designed to stop or delay construction of horse slaughter or processing facilities based on permit or licensing challenges or on environmental grounds; and WHEREAS, the Midwestern Legislative Conference of the Council of State Governments at its 2007 and 2008 meetings passed resolutions in support of horse processing and related activities in the United States: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the Senate of the Eighty-fourth Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the House of Representatives concurring therein, that the South Dakota Legislature supports actions proposed by the state legislatures in North Dakota, Montana, Illinois, and other states to facilitate the resumption of equine processing and slaughter in the United States and urges the Congress and the United States Department of Agriculture to reinstate USDA's inspection program for horse slaughter facilities and to lift restrictions on horse slaughter and processing activities and facilities in the United States."}, {"bill_id": 1326, "bill_version_id": 9292, "bill_version": "Enrolled", "bill_version_date": "2009-03-12T11:49:52.537-05:00", "bill_text": ""}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 1326, "action_date": "2009-03-09T14:00:00-05:00", "document_id": 8998, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/8998.pdf", "status_text": "First Reading", "journal_page": 681, "committee_id_action": 54, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 1326, "action_date": "2009-03-10T11:00:00-05:00", "document_id": 9077, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/9077.pdf", "status_text": "Adopt Resolution", "journal_page": 702, "committee_id_action": 54, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 5231, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [653, 680, 682, 685, 702, 700, 655, 673, 663, 677, 675, 634, 697, 659, 690, 636, 667, 656, 669, 661, 686, 701, 662, 703, 664, 638, 648, 640, 689, 705, 642, 671], "Nay": [704, 649], "Excused": [694]}}, {"bill_id": 1326, "action_date": "2009-03-11T11:00:00-05:00", "document_id": 9220, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/9220.pdf", "status_text": "First Reading", "journal_page": 771, "committee_id_action": 56, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 1326, "action_date": "2009-03-12T10:00:00-05:00", "document_id": 9282, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/9282.pdf", "status_text": "Concurred in Resolution", "journal_page": 791, "committee_id_action": 56, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 5340, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [716, 720, 666, 688, 676, 670, 726, 715, 699, 674, 635, 692, 708, 651, 643, 712, 709, 660, 693, 644, 724, 727, 721, 652, 737, 672, 698, 717, 654, 711, 719, 683, 695, 696, 722, 645, 637, 665, 687, 678, 650, 646, 668, 639, 735, 679, 734, 714, 731, 736, 713, 710, 728, 657, 641, 658, 647, 691, 723, 718, 684, 733, 732, 707, 681], "Excused": [706, 738], "Nay": [725, 730, 729]}}]}
