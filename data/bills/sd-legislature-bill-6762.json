BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 54-11-10 be repealed. 54-11-10. Upon written notice, a credit card issuer may change the terms of any credit card agreement, if such right of amendment has been reserved, regardless of whether the card holder can use the card for new purchases. However, the following changes to the credit card agreement, effective as to existing balances, do not become binding on the parties if the card holder, within twenty-five days of the effective date of the change, furnishes written notice to the issuer, at the address designated by the issuer, that the card holder does not agree to abide by such changes: (1) Modifying the circumstances under which a finance charge will be imposed; (2) Altering the method used to calculate finance charges; or (3) Increasing finance charges, fees, and other costs. Any other change to the credit card agreement modifying the manner in which the issuer and card holder resolve disputes arising out of their relationship do not become binding on the parties if the card holder, within twenty-five days of the effective date of the change, furnishes written notice to the issuer, at the address designated by the issuer, that the card holder does not agree to abide by such changes. Use of the card after the effective date of the change of terms is deemed to be an acceptance of the new terms, even if the twenty-five-day period has not expired. Unless otherwise required by 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 226, in effect on February 22, 2010, a written change of terms notice is not required if the proposed change in terms has been communicated by the issuer to the card holder and the card holder agrees. Section 2. That \u00a7 54-11-11 be repealed. 54-11-11. In lieu of the card holder's right to reject certain changes in terms within twenty-five days pursuant to \u00a7 54-11-10, the issuer may require the card holder to provide written notice of such rejection not less than five days prior to the effective date of the change if the issuer has sent notice of the proposed change in terms under \u00a7\u00a7 54-11-10 and 54-11-11 to the card holder not less than thirty days prior to the effective date of the change. The issuer may provide the card holder an alternative means by which to communicate the card holder's rejection of the change in terms, so long as the alternative means is not more burdensome to the card holder. Section 3. That chapter 54-11 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: A credit card issuer may change the terms of any credit card agreement if such right of amendment has been reserved. A credit card issuer shall provide notice of such change, and the right to reject such change, in accordance with, and solely to the extent required by 12 C.F.R. 1026, in effect on January 1, 2015. No credit card issuer may make a change that is specifically prohibited by 12 C.F.R. 1026."}, {"bill_id": 6762, "bill_version_id": 36189, "bill_version": "Enrolled", "bill_version_date":
