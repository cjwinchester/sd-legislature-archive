BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That the code be amended by adding a NEW SECTION to read: Notwithstanding any contrary provision in chapter 24-13, 24-15, or 24-15A, an inmate who: (1) Has a terminal illness; (2) Is seriously ill and not likely to recover; (3) Requires extensive medical care or significant chronic medical care; (4) Is at least sixty-five years of age, has served at least ten consecutive years of the inmate's sentence incarcerated, whose current sentences are for convictions of a Class 3 felony or below and whose medical care needs are at least double the average annual medical cost of the inmate population; or (5) Is at least seventy years of age and has served at least thirty consecutive years of the inmate's sentence incarcerated; and (6) Is not serving a capital punishment sentence; is eligible for compassionate parole consideration. Section 2. That the code be amended by adding a NEW SECTION to read: The secretary of corrections may consider referrals for compassionate parole consideration from the inmate's health care provider or the warden. If the secretary determines the inmate meets the criteria for compassionate parole consideration as set forth in section 1 of this Act, the secretary may refer the inmate for a compassionate parole hearing. The executive director of the Board of Pardons and Paroles shall schedule a discretionary, compassionate parole hearing with the board within three months of receipt of the referral. Section 3. That the code be amended by adding a NEW SECTION to read: The Board of Pardons and Paroles shall consider the following factors in determining the grant or denial of a compassionate parole: (1) The inmate's assessed risk level; (2) The inmate's conduct in prison; (3) The inmate's conduct while on extended confinement, if applicable; (4) Sentence served and sentence remaining; (5) Offense and chronicity of criminal behavior; (6) Prognosis and incapacitation level; (7) The inmate's compliance with health care ordered by a health care provider; (8) Release plan including provisions for health care; (9) Input, if any, of the sentencing judge, the prosecuting attorney, and the victim; (10) If the care and supervision that the inmate requires and is anticipated to require can be provided in a more medically appropriate or cost effective manner than the Department of Corrections; (11) Allowing a geriatric or terminally ill person to live at a location outside of prison prior to death; and (12) The ability to adequately monitor the inmate, after release, to ensure public safety.

If the inmate no longer meets the criteria for compassionate parole as set forth in section 1 of this Act, the inmate's health care provider or the warden shall notify the secretary of corrections. The secretary may remove the inmate from compassionate parole consideration. An inmate removed from compassionate parole consideration is subject to applicable parole provisions under chapters 24-13, 24-15, and 24-15A notwithstanding the provisions of this Act or a pending compassionate parole hearing.
