BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. Any purchase of more than twenty acres of land, for whatever purpose, by whatever funding source, shall only be contracted for by the Department of Game, Fish and Parks subject to subsequent legislative approval by specific statutory enactment. Within sixteen months from the date of any contract to purchase twenty or more acres of land, the secretary of the department shall have legislation introduced in the Legislature providing for specific legislative approval of the purchase. Failure of the Legislature to enact specific statutory approval for any such purchase within twenty-one months of the date of the contract renders the contract void. 250 copies of this document were printed by the South Dakota Legislative Research Council at a cost of $.04 per page. .
