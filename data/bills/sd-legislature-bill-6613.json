BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 22-14-9 be amended to read as follows: 22-14-9. Any person, other than a law enforcement officer or parole agent acting under color of authority, who: (1) Carries a pistol or revolver, loaded or unloaded, concealed on or about his or her person without a permit as provided in chapter 23-7; or (2) Carries a pistol or revolver, loaded or unloaded, concealed in any vehicle while operating the vehicle, without a permit as provided in chapter 23-7; is guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor. The provisions of this section do not apply to a person who is eighteen years of age or older who is able to lawfully possess a pistol or revolver pursuant to the laws of this state, regardless of whether the person is a resident of this state. Section 2. That \u00a7 22-14-9.1 be amended to read as follows: 22-14-9.1. No person may possess a concealed pistol in accordance with chapter 23-7 or this chapter unless that person also has in his or her physical possession a valid South Dakota permit to carry a concealed pistol or a permit effective pursuant to \u00a7 23-7-7.3. Any violation of this section is a petty offense. However, if within twenty-four hours of being charged with a violation of this section, the person produces a permit to carry a concealed pistol which was valid at the time of the alleged offense in the office of the officer making the demand, the charge shall be dismissed. The mere possession or carrying of a pistol, openly or concealed, with or without a permit as provided in chapter 23-7, is not reasonable suspicion or probable cause for a law enforcement officer to disarm or seize an otherwise law abiding person. Section 3. That \u00a7 22-14-27 be amended to read as follows: 22-14-27. It is not a defense to a prosecution under \u00a7 22-14-23 that the defendant was the holder of a concealed weapons permit issued pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 23-7-7 and 23-7-7.1, or that the defendant falls within the provisions of \u00a7 22-14-9."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 6613, "action_date": "2015-01-27T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 33848, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/33848.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 177, "committee_id_action": 286, "committee_id_assigned": 282, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 6613, "action_date": "2015-01-29T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 34099, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/34099.pdf", "status_text": "Referred to", "journal_page": 226, "committee_id_action": 286, "committee_id_assigned": 279, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 6613, "action_date": "2015-02-09T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 34630, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/34630.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 279, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 6613, "action_date": "2015-02-09T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 34694, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/34694.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to the 41st legislative day", "journal_page": 338, "committee_id_action": 279, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 18361, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [915, 884, 947, 882, 879, 953, 881, 869, 912, 874, 954, 924], "Excused": [921]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/6613"}
