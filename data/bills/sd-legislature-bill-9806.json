Qualified beneficiaries shall bear the cost of any laboratory fees associated with enrollment in specific courses. Each qualified beneficiary shall be classified as a resident for tuition purposes, regardless of the beneficiary's actual legal residence. The cost of participation in contracts authorized in this section shall be based on the current and projected fees included in the plan within the Board of Regents system, the number of credit hours or semesters included in the plan, and the number of years expected to elapse between the purchase of the plan on behalf of a qualified beneficiary and the exercise of the benefits provided in the plan by the beneficiary.

Dormitory residence plans shall be purchased in increments of two semesters. The cost of participation in the dormitory residence plan shall be based primarily on the average current and projected housing fees within the Board of Regents system and state technical institutes, respectively, and the number of years expected to elapse between the purchase of the plan on behalf of a qualified beneficiary and the exercise of the benefits provided in the plan by the beneficiary. Qualified beneficiaries shall have the highest priority in the assignment of housing within university and technical institute residence halls. Each state postsecondary institution and technical institute may specify the residence halls or other university-held residences eligible for inclusion in the plan. In addition, any state postsecondary institution or state technical institution may request immediate termination of a dormitory residence contract based on a violation or multiple violations of rules of the residence hall or other university-held residences. In the event that sufficient housing is not available for all qualified beneficiaries, the board shall refund the purchaser or qualified beneficiary an amount equal to the fees charged for dormitory residence during that semester. Section 17. That the code be amended by adding a NEW SECTION to read: A qualified beneficiary may apply the benefits of an advance payment contract toward any eligible educational institution as defined in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 529 of the Internal Revenue Code. The board shall transfer or cause to be transferred to the institution designated by the qualified beneficiary an amount not to exceed the redemption value of the advance payment contract at a state postsecondary institution or state technical institute. If the cost of registration or housing fees at the institution are less than the corresponding fees at a state postsecondary institution, the amount transferred may not exceed the actual cost of registration and housing fees. A transfer authorized under this section may not exceed the number of semester credit hours or semesters of dormitory residence contracted on behalf of a qualified beneficiary. Section 18. That the code be amended by adding a NEW SECTION to read: The board shall develop advance payment contracts for registration and may develop advance payment contracts for dormitory residence as provided in section 13 of this Act. Advance payment contracts are exempt from title 58 and shall include the following: (1) The amount of the payment or payments and the number of payments required from a purchaser on behalf of a qualified beneficiary; (2) The terms and conditions under which purchasers shall remit payments, including the date or dates upon which each payment is due; (3) Provisions for late payment charges and for default; (4) Provisions for penalty fees for withdrawals from the fund; (5) The name and date of birth of the qualified beneficiary on whose behalf the contract is drawn, and the terms and conditions under which another person may be substituted as the qualified beneficiary; (6) The name of any person who may terminate the contract.

Time expended by a qualified beneficiary as an active duty member of any of the armed services of the United States shall be added to the period of time specified by the board. A purchaser or qualified beneficiary whose advance payment contract is terminated pursuant to this section is not entitled to a refund. The board shall retain any moneys paid by the purchaser for an advance payment contract that has been terminated in accordance with this section and the moneys may be transferred to the needs based grant program created in chapter 13-55A; and (12) Any other terms and conditions determined by the board to be necessary or proper. Section 19. That the code be amended by adding a NEW SECTION to read: A refund may not exceed the amount paid into the fund by the purchaser except as provided in subdivisions (2), (3), and (6) of section 18 of this Act. If the beneficiary is awarded a scholarship, the terms of which cover the benefits included in the advance payment contracts, moneys paid for the purchase of the advance payment contracts shall be refunded to the purchaser in semester installments coinciding with the tuition owed by the beneficiary in an amount that, in total, does not exceed the redemption value of the advance payment contract at a state postsecondary institution. If the beneficiary dies or becomes disabled, moneys paid for the purchase of advance payment contracts shall be refunded to the purchaser in an amount not to exceed the redemption value of the advance payment contract at a state postsecondary institution. If an advance payment contract is converted from one registration plan to a plan of lesser value, the amount refunded may not exceed the difference between the amount paid for the original contract and the amount that would have been paid for the contract to which the plan is converted had the converted plan been purchased under the same payment plan at the time the original advance payment contract was executed. A refund may not be authorized through an advance payment contract for any school year partially attended, but not completed. For purposes of this section, a school year partially attended, but not completed, means any one semester in which the student is still enrolled at the conclusion of time allotted for dropping a course, but withdraws before the end of the semester. If a beneficiary does not complete a South Dakota Opportunity University Plan or South Dakota Opportunity Technical Institution Plan for reasons other than specified in this section, the purchaser shall receive a refund of the amount paid into the fund for the remaining unattended years of the advance payment contract under rules promulgated by the board. Section 20. That the code be amended by adding a NEW SECTION to read: Information that identifies the purchasers or beneficiaries of any plan under this Act, including any advance payment account activities, is confidential. However, the board may authorize the program's records administrator to release information to a state postsecondary institution or state technical institution in which a beneficiary may enroll or is enrolled. The institution shall maintain the confidentiality of the information. Section 21. That the code be amended by adding a NEW SECTION to read: If the board determines the prepaid program is not financially feasible, the board may discontinue providing the program. Any qualified beneficiary who has been accepted by and is enrolled or is within two years of enrollment in an eligible state postsecondary institution at the time of the discontinuance may exercise all the benefits for which the beneficiary contracted. All other contract holders shall receive a refund of the amount paid in and an additional amount in the nature of interest at a rate that corresponds, at a minimum, to the prevailing interest rates for savings accounts provided by banks and savings and loan associations. Section 22. That the code be amended by adding a NEW SECTION to read: A nonprofit organization described in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code and exempt from taxation under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code may purchase advance payment contracts for a scholarship program that has been approved by the board and is operated by the purchasing organization.

Section 26. There is hereby appropriated from the general fund, after the transfer of earnings from the education enhancement trust fund created in Article XII, Section 6 of the South Dakota Constitution, pursuant to \u00a7 4-5-29.2, the sum of one million two hundred thousand dollars ($1,200,000), or so much thereof as may be necessary, to the Prepaid College Board established in section 3 of this Act to provide the initial funding for the prepaid college program established in section 2 of this Act..
