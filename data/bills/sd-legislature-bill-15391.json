Any person confined in the state penitentiary for a conviction of murder or any felony under chapter 22-22 may petition a court of competent jurisdiction to order deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) testing on evidence relevant to that person's case and on a sample drawn from that person. The court shall schedule a hearing on the petition within one hundred twenty days. The court on hearing the petition shall consider: (1) The likelihood of sufficient DNA being recovered from the evidence to generate a sufficient sample for testing; and (2) The likelihood that the results of DNA testing, if results do not match the DNA of the petitioner, would, if introduced at trial, produce sufficient reasonable doubt to prevent conviction. If the court finds sufficient evidence, it shall order DNA testing to be done at the state's expense. The sample from the petitioner shall be collected by a health professional licensed or certified to do so. The sample from the evidence shall be collected by a competent professional. If the court determines that the results of testing, if introduced at trial, might reasonably produce sufficient doubt regarding the petitioner's guilt or result in a reversal of the petitioner's conviction, the court shall immediately order a trial de novo. If the test results do not result in a new trial or if the petitioner is reconvicted and that conviction, if appealed, is upheld, the petitioner shall reimburse the state for the costs of the services and testing.

Any court or law enforcement agency of the state shall preserve any DNA evidence in its possession that it knows or should know exists, if that evidence is relevant to any conviction of murder or of any felony under chapter 22-22. No court or law enforcement agency needs to preserve DNA evidence if the conviction has been overturned and the state has exhausted its appeals or declined to appeal, the convicted person has completed the sentence and has not indicated any intention to appeal, or the convicted person has died without filing an appeal.
