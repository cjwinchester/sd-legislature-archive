BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. During the 1997 legislative interim, the Executive Board of the Legislative Research Council shall conduct an interim study of the social, economic, political, and cultural impacts of video gaming, casino gaming, and lotteries as currently practiced in this State. The committee shall devote special attention to the following: (1) What is the relationship between the benefits of gaming to the State and its communities, including the city of Deadwood and the nine tribes, the benefits to the segments of private industry and business involved in state gaming, the social and economic damages to problem gamblers and their families, and societal costs as measured in the increased demand for social services whether provided by private charities or public welfare institutions; (2) What is the degree to which gaming fosters criminal activity, including juvenile crime; (3) What relationship does the concentration of casino gaming in the city of Deadwood and on the nine tribal reservations bear to the equitable distribution of both the benefits and detriments of gaming as a statewide phenomenon; and (4) What impact might the abolition or reduction of gaming activities have on the State and its communities, including the city of Deadwood and the nine tribes, private industry and business involved in gaming activities, and all South Dakotans, but problem gamblers and their families in particular, and how might any adverse impacts be mitigated or resolved. Section 2. In conducting this study, the committee may work with similar federal, state, or private initiatives to the extent that such other studies may reflect the South Dakota experience. The committee shall solicit the testimony of a broad spectrum of governmental, tribal, municipal, business, and private experiences and may utilize any available funding to bring in appropriate professional expertise."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 12950, "action_date": "1997-01-31T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 72893, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/72893.pdf", "status_text": "First read in Senate and referred to", "journal_page": 262, "committee_id_action": 545, "committee_id_assigned": 527, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 12950, "action_date": "1997-02-05T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 72287, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/72287.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 527, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 12950, "action_date": "1997-02-05T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 72287, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/72287.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to another day", "journal_page": 318, "committee_id_action": 527, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 12950, "action_date": "1997-02-07T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 72309, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/72309.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 527, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 12950, "action_date": "1997-02-10T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 72316, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/72316.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 527, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 12950, "action_date": "1997-02-10T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 72316, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/72316.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass,", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 527, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "F", "vote": {"vote_id": 36197, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [1911, 1956, 1986, 1969, 1927], "Yea": [1915, 1912, 1930, 1946]}}, {"bill_id": 12950, "action_date": "1997-02-10T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 72316, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/72316.pdf", "status_text": "Tabled", "journal_page": 368, "committee_id_action": 527, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 36715, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [1911, 1956, 1986, 1969, 1927], "Nay": [1915, 1912, 1930, 1946]}}]}
