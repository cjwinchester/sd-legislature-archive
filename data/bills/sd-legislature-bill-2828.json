At the same time that foundation program state aid is distributed to school districts pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 13-13-10.1 to 13-13-41, inclusive, the secretary of the Department of Education shall distribute funds to sparse school districts by multiplying the result of the calculation in either subdivision 13-13-78(2) or subdivision 13-13-78(3) by seventy-five percent of the per student allocation as defined in \u00a7 13-13-10.1. However, no sparse school district may receive a sparsity benefit in any year that exceeds one hundred twenty-three thousand seven hundred fifty dollars. If the appropriation is insufficient to fully fund all sparse school districts as per the calculation in either subdivision 13-13-78(2) or subdivision 13-13-78(3), each eligible district shall receive a prorata share of the total appropriated amount. 135 copies were printed on recycled paper by the South Dakota Legislative Research Council at a cost of $.075 per page. .
