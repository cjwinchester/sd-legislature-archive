WHEREAS, the State Penitentiary, built as a federal prison in 1881, has been placed on the Register of Historic Places; and WHEREAS, years of neglect and lack of proper maintenance have brought about the current deteriorating condition of the State Penitentiary's historic wall; and WHEREAS, inmate labor today should be used to restore the wall just as inmate labor was used over a century ago to construct the very wall which would confine them; and WHEREAS, studies have shown that the demolition and replacement of the entire wall is unnecessary and a wasteful use of state revenue; and WHEREAS, security of the general public, prison staff, and inmates must not be compromised: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the House of Representatives of the Seventy- fifth Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the Senate concurring therein, that the Department of Corrections do further study and conduct public hearings before dismantling any more of the existing wall at the State Penitentiary, institute a systematic program of regular preventive maintenance to ensure the long preservation of this historic site, and provide that any Sioux quartzite stone salvaged from the wall be warehoused for further public use in Minnehaha County."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 15235, "action_date": "2000-01-21T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 85751, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/85751.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 651, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 15235, "action_date": "2000-01-24T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 85760, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/85760.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 651, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 15235, "action_date": "2000-01-26T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 85784, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/85784.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 651, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 15235, "action_date": "2000-01-26T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 85784, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/85784.pdf", "status_text": "Adopt Resolution", "journal_page": 243, "committee_id_action": 651, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 45421, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [2313, 2337, 2345, 2351, 2360, 2388, 2393], "Nay": [2333, 2353, 2363, 2372, 2319], "Excused": [2368]}}, {"bill_id": 15235, "action_date": "2000-01-27T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 85644, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/85644.pdf", "status_text": "Adopt Resolution", "journal_page": 266, "committee_id_action": 656, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "F", "vote": {"vote_id": 45996, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [2305, 2308, 2309, 2319, 2323, 2324, 2325, 2327, 2328, 2332, 2333, 2334, 2336, 2342, 2349, 2350, 2353, 2354, 2356, 2361, 2363, 2366, 2370, 2372, 2373, 2377, 2379, 2383, 2384, 2385, 2387, 2393, 2397, 2406, 2407, 2408, 2351], "Yea": [2312, 2313, 2314, 2315, 2316, 2317, 2318, 2321, 2337, 2338, 2341, 2343, 2345, 2348, 2355, 2359, 2360, 2362, 2367, 2368, 2371, 2374, 2378, 2382, 2388, 2390, 2392, 2394, 2396, 2401, 2402, 2403], "Excused": [2404]}}]}
