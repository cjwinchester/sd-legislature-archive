The interest rate used in determining minimum nonforfeiture amounts shall be an annual rate of interest determined as the lesser of three percent per annum and the following, which shall be specified in the contract if the interest rate will be reset: (1) The five\u2011year constant maturity treasury rate reported by the Federal Reserve as of a date, or average over a period, rounded to the nearest one\u2011twentieth of one percent, specified in the contract no longer than fifteen months prior to the contract issue date or redetermination date pursuant to this section; (2) Reduced by one hundred twenty\u2011five basis points; (3) Where the resulting interest rate is not less than one percent fifteen-hundredths of one percent; and (4) The interest rate shall apply for an initial period and may be redetermined for additional periods. The redetermination date, basis, and period, if any, shall be stated in the contract. The basis is the date or average over a specified period that produces the value of the five\u2011year constant maturity treasury rate to be used at each redetermination date.
