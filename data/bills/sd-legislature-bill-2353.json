Notwithstanding \u00a7 32-25-7 or chapter 1-26, the secretary of transportation may establish limited speed zones through highway work areas on the state trunk highways if the secretary of public safety and the secretary of transportation, after consultation with the director of the highway patrol, agree the limited speed zones are necessary for the protection of life and property.

Such signs shall be posted only during the hours when work is actually being performed. The location and duration of this posting shall be filed with the secretary of transportation. A violation of the speed limit established under the provisions of this section is a Class 2 misdemeanor. Any fine for a violation of this section while workers are present shall be double the usual fine for speeding but may not exceed the maximum fine for a Class 2 misdemeanor as provided by \u00a7 22-6-2. Signs showing that any such a fine will be double the usual speeding fine shall be erected in advance of the regulatory speed limit signs. Section 2. That \u00a7 32-25-7.2 be repealed. 32-25-7.2. Notwithstanding the provisions of \u00a7 32-25-7 or of any rule promulgated pursuant to that section, the secretary of transportation may establish limited speed zones on the state trunk highways if highway work being performed necessitates maintaining head to head traffic through or around the construction area and if the secretary of public safety and the secretary of transportation, after consultation with the director of the highway patrol, agree the limited speed zones are necessary for the safety of the traveling public. The beginning and end of each limited speed zone established under this section shall be conspicuously posted with signs showing the maximum speed permissible. The signs shall be posted during the period of time the highway work being performed necessitates maintaining head to head traffic through or around the construction area.
