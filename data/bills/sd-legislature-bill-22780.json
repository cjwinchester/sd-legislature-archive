WHEREAS, the First Amendment to the United States Constitution protects the right of the people to petition their government; and WHEREAS, the right to petition the government often involves transmitting information and articulating how a legislative decision will likely affect a particular issue, cause, circumstance, or group of people; and WHEREAS, given the realities of work commitments and travel constraints, the right of the people to petition their government is often exercised, on their behalf, by lobbyists; and WHEREAS, lobbying has, since its earliest days, been a mechanism by which the people could, directly or indirectly, participate in the legislative decision-making process; and WHEREAS, the right of the people to petition their government does not, through a metamorphical process, extend to or become a right or obligation of the executive branch; and WHEREAS, Article II of the Constitution of South Dakota promotes a system of checks and balances through the creation of three distinct branches of government, each having specifically prescribed duties; and WHEREAS, while the Constitution of South Dakota assigns to the Legislature the power to legislate, it assigns to the executive branch only the duty to faithfully execute the law; WHEREAS, it is a direct conflict of interest for the executive branch to introduce legislation that, once enacted, is subject to the executive branch's independent exercise of enforcement authority; NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the House of Representatives of the Ninety-Seventh Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the Senate concurring therein, that the executive branch is urged to serve as a transparent resource in the provision of accurate and objective information to the Legislature, but to refrain from utilizing public resources, directly or indirectly, to introduce legislation or lobby members of the Legislature, in an attempt to seek, or promote, a specific legislative outcome."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 22780, "action_date": "2022-01-27T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 230262, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/230262.pdf", "status_text": "First Reading House", "journal_page": 136, "committee_id_action": 1008, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 22780, "action_date": "2022-01-31T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 231012, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/231012.pdf", "status_text": "Referred to", "journal_page": 156, "committee_id_action": 1008, "committee_id_assigned": 1016, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 22780, "action_date": "2022-02-09T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 232708, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/232708.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 1016, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 22780, "action_date": "2022-02-09T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 232709, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/232709.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 1016, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "F", "vote": {"vote_id": 73119, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [3912, 3923, 3941, 3965, 3989, 3995, 3957, 3982], "Yea": [3916, 3942, 3946, 3954, 4011]}}, {"bill_id": 22780, "action_date": "2022-02-09T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 232709, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/232709.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to the 41st legislative day", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 1016, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 73120, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [3912, 3916, 3923, 3941, 3965, 3989, 3995, 3957, 3982], "Nay": [3942, 3946, 3954, 4011]}}]}
