The court shall order a court services officer or the director of a medical facility responsible for administering to monitor compliance of the regimen imposed on an acquitted person conditionally discharged under \u00a7 23A-26-12.5 . The person appointed by the court shall notify the prosecuting attorney and the court having jurisdiction over the person of any failure of the person to comply with the regimen. Upon such notice, or upon other probable cause to believe that the person has failed to comply with the prescribed regimen of medical, psychiatric, or psychological care or treatment, the person may be arrested, and, upon arrest, shall be taken without unnecessary delay before the court having jurisdiction over him or her . The court shall, after hearing, determine whether the person should be remanded to a suitable facility on the ground that, in light of his the failure to comply with the prescribed regimen of medical, psychiatric, or psychological care or treatment, his or her continued release would create a substantial risk of bodily injury to another person or serious damage to property of another."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 21021, "action_date": "2007-01-16T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 110292, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/110292.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 80, "committee_id_action": 923, "committee_id_assigned": 921, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 21021, "action_date": "2007-01-19T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 110442, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/110442.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 921, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 21021, "action_date": "2007-01-19T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 110442, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/110442.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to 41st legislative day", "journal_page": 126, "committee_id_action": 921, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 66053, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [3579, 3598, 3599, 3638, 3651, 3672, 3673, 3676, 3582], "Nay": [3592, 3594, 3619, 3632]}}]}
