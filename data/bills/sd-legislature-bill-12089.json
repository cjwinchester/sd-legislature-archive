Section 3. That a NEW SECTION be added: 34-54-3. Processors that provide facial recognition services--Requirements. A processor that provides facial recognition services shall make available an application programming interface or other technical capability, chosen by the processor, to enable a controller or third party to conduct legitimate, independent, and reasonable tests of those facial recognition services for accuracy and unfair performance differences across distinct subpopulations. The subpopulations may be defined by race, skin tone, ethnicity, gender, age, disability status, or other protected characteristic that is objectively determinable or self-identified by the persons portrayed in the testing dataset. If the results of that independent testing identify material unfair performance differences across subpopulations, and those results are disclosed directly to the processor, who, acting reasonably, determines that the methodology and results of that testing are valid, the processor shall develop and implement a plan to mitigate the identified performance differences. Nothing in this section prevents a processor from prohibiting the use of the processor's facial recognition service by a competitor for competitive purposes. A processor that provides facial recognition services shall provide documentation that includes general information that explains the capabilities and limitations of the services in plain language and enables testing of the services in accordance with this section. A processor that provides facial recognition services shall prohibit, in the contract by which the controller is permitted to use the facial recognition service, the use of facial recognition services by the controller to unlawfully discriminate under federal or state law against persons or groups of persons. Section 4. That a NEW SECTION be added: 34-54-4. Notice--Requirements--Contents.

Section 9. That a NEW SECTION be added: 34-54-9. Personal rights--Request to controller--Process. A person may exercise the rights set forth in this section by submitting a request, at any time, to a controller specifying which rights the person wishes to exercise. Except as provided in this chapter, the controller shall comply with a request to exercise the rights pursuant to this section. The processor shall assist the controller by appropriate technical and organizational measures, insofar as this is possible, for the fulfillment of the controller\u2019s obligation to respond to any person's requests to exercise the person's rights pursuant to this section.

A controller shall inform a person of any action taken on a request under this section without undue delay and in any event within thirty days of receipt of the request. That period may be extended by sixty additional days if reasonably necessary, taking into account the complexity and number of requests. The controller shall inform the person of any extension within thirty days of receipt of the request, together with the reasons for the delay. If a controller does not take action on the request of a person, the controller shall inform the person without undue delay and at the latest within thirty days of receipt of the request of the reasons for not taking action. Information provided under this section shall be provided by the controller free of charge to the person. If requests from a person are manifestly unfounded or excessive, in particular because of their repetitive character, the controller may either: (i) charge a reasonable fee to cover the administrative costs of complying with the request; or (ii) refuse to act on the request. The controller bears the burden of demonstrating the manifestly unfounded or excessive character of the request. A controller is not required to comply with a request to exercise any of the rights under this section if the controller is unable to determine, using commercially reasonable efforts, that the request is being made by the person who is entitled to exercise such rights. In any such case, the controller may request the provision of additional information reasonably necessary to determine that the request is being made by the person who is entitled to exercise such rights.

The attorney general has exclusive authority to enforce this chapter by bringing an action in the name of the state, or as parens patriae on behalf of any person residing in the state, to enforce this chapter. A violation of this chapter may not serve as the basis for, or be subject to, a private right of action under this chapter or under any other law. This may not be construed to relieve any party from any duties or obligations imposed under other laws, the state Constitution, or the United States Constitution. Any controller or processor that violates this chapter is subject to an injunction and liable for a civil penalty of not more than two thousand five hundred dollars for each violation or seven thousand five hundred dollars for each intentional violation. If more than one controller or processor, or both a controller and a processor, contribute to the same violation of this chapter, the liability for the violation shall be allocated among the parties according to principles of comparative fault. Section 11. That a NEW SECTION be added: 34-54-13. Meaningful human review. An agency or controller using a facial recognition service to make decisions that produce legal effects concerning persons or similarly significant effects concerning persons shall ensure that those decisions are subject to meaningful human review. Any decision that produces legal effects concerning a person or similarly significant effects concerning a person shall include denial of consequential services or support, such as financial and lending services, housing, insurance, education enrollment, criminal justice, employment opportunities, health care services, and access to basic necessities such as food and water.
