BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 32-22-24 be amended to read as follows: 32-22-24. The maximum axle and axle group loadings as set forth in \u00a7 32-22-16 shall be reduced during the period of each year from February fifteenth to April thirtieth, inclusive. The proper highway authority, responsible for maintenance of the highways, shall set reduced load limits during this period and may increase, lessen, or remove these restrictions if highway conditions warrant. That authority may be exercised without formal resolution if the highway authority erects or causes to be erected and maintained signs designating the restrictions. If highway and climatic conditions warrant, the proper highway authority may extend the time period mentioned in this section by ordinance or resolution. Nothing in this requirement, however, removes or interferes with the proper highway authority imposing restrictions as set forth in \u00a7\u00a7 32-14-6, 32-14-7, and 32-22-25. Moreover, during the time period mentioned in this section the transportation commission may, pursuant to \u00a7 32-22-42, allow the issuance of overweight permits to heavier vehicles to permit such vehicles to be operated on those highways which the commission designates as capable of handling heavier loads. If the highway authority is a county or a township, the authority may issue, during the time period mentioned in this section, overweight permits pursuant to \u00a7 32-22-40 to permit heavier vehicles to be operated on those highways that the authority designates as capable of handling heavier loads. A violation of this section is a Class 2 misdemeanor."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 1963, "action_date": "2010-01-28T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 11385, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/11385.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 226, "committee_id_action": 86, "committee_id_assigned": 81, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 1963, "action_date": "2010-02-11T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 11867, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/11867.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 81, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 1963, "action_date": "2010-02-11T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 12123, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/12123.pdf", "status_text": "Tabled", "journal_page": 365, "committee_id_action": 81, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 6367, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [813, 835, 843, 816, 742, 839, 836, 762, 746, 838, 777, 759], "Excused": [801]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/1963"}
