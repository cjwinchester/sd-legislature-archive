BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 12-2-4 be amended to read as follows: 12-2-4. Notwithstanding \u00a7 12-2-3, the county auditor may, upon request of the superintendent of an election precinct, if an emergency exists by reason of mechanical failure of a voting machine or an unanticipated shortage of ballots or like unforeseen event warrants it, extend the polling hours for that precinct until the emergency situation has been resolved. The governing body holding a local election may delay the opening of any polling place for any election except a primary or general election for one week if weather conditions make it impossible to open at the correct time. The polling place shall then remain open for the same number of hours as it would normally have been open. If the emergency situation is not resolved within two hours, except for a primary or general election, the polling place shall remain closed for one week and reopen at the time of the closure of the polling place. Section 2. That chapter 12-2 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: No earlier than twenty-four hours before the polls open, the person in charge of the election may call a special emergency meeting, pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 1-25-1 and 1-25-1.1, of the local governing board to postpone any election, except a primary or general election, for one week if the weather conditions put into question the opening of a polling place. The polling place shall then remain open for the same number of hours as it would normally have been open. Absentee voting shall continue pursuant to chapter 12-19. Section 3. That chapter 12-2 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: The person in charge of the election shall use any and all means necessary to notify the voters in the jurisdiction of the postponement of an election pursuant to this chapter. If the postponement misses the deadline for the official newspaper, a notice shall be posted in three of the most public places within the jurisdiction. Section 4. Whereas, this Act is necessary for the support of the state government and its existing public institutions, an emergency is hereby declared to exist, and this Act shall be in full force and effect from and after its passage and approval."}, {"bill_id": 5341, "bill_version_id": 30247, "bill_version": "Enrolled", "bill_version_date": "2014-02-12T09:30:44.4-06:00", "bill_text": ""}], "amendments":
