The department may examine the books and records of the seller and purchaser for this purpose. The failure of the claimant to furnish the books or records for examination shall constitute a waiver of all rights to the refund on account of the transaction questioned. Section 16. That \u00a7 10-47B-154 be repealed. 10-47B-154. The Legislature finds that not all motor fuel taxes which qualify for the nonhighway agricultural motor fuel tax refund are, in fact, refunded under the procedure set forth in this chapter. The Legislature further finds that a certain amount of these unclaimed tax refunds from the sale of motor fuel for nonhighway agricultural uses should be utilized for agricultural purposes in a manner which benefits both agriculture and the citizens of the state by preserving its natural resources. Therefore, the Legislature declares that an amount equal to thirty-five percent of the claimed refunds authorized by \u00a7 10-47B-119, not to exceed one million five hundred thousand dollars in any single fiscal year, represents the amount of unclaimed tax refunds from the sale of motor fuel tax for nonhighway agricultural uses. The Legislature further declares that it is the policy of this state to use these funds, representing the unclaimed tax refunds from the sale of motor fuel for nonhighway agricultural purposes, to implement the coordinated natural resources conservation program."}, {"bill_id": 2701, "bill_version_id": 17813, "bill_version": "Enrolled", "bill_version_date": "2011-03-03T09:45:44.553-06:00",
