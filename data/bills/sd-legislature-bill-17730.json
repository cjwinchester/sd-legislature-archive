In implementing the terms of \u00a7 13-11-9, a separate weighted average tax levy of the receiving districts shall be calculated for agricultural property and for nonagricultural property for each sending school district as follows: (1) The levy per thousand dollars of taxable valuation for agricultural property for each receiving school district shall be multiplied by the number of children from the sending school district to whom the receiving school district is providing educational services; (2) Add together the products from subdivision (1) for each receiving school district; (3) Divide the sum from subdivision (2) by the total number of students that the contracting school district is sending to the receiving school districts pursuant to \u00a7 13-15-1.3. The quotient is the weighted average tax levy per one thousand dollars of taxable valuation for agricultural property; (4) The weighted average tax levy per thousand dollars of taxable valuation for nonagricultural acreage, owner-occupied, single-family dwellings, and nonagricultural land property shall be obtained by adjusting the quotient in subdivision (3) in accordance with the provisions of \u00a7 10-12-31 repeating the procedure outlined in subdivisions (1) to (3), inclusive, for each class of property ; and (5) The sum of the levies assessed for all funds in the sending district shall be equal to or greater than the sum of all levies for all funds in the receiving district.
