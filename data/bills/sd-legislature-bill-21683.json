Upon the filing of a petition for the adoption of a minor child the petitioner therein shall notify the Department of Social Services, by mailing to the department a copy of the petition. The petitioner also shall notify the department of the date fixed for hearing the petition, or mail to the department a copy of the order fixing the date of the hearing. The department, except in the case of a stepparent adopting a stepchild, shall then approve or disapprove the report of the child welfare agency, if any, showing whether the proposed adoption is in a suitable home for the child, why the parent or parents wish to give up the child, and whether the child is suitable for adoption. The department shall make a recommendation as to the desirability of the adoption. The department may appear in any procedure the same as the party in interest, and may request a postponement of hearing on the petition in the event more time is needed for its investigation. This section only applies to a child in the custody of the department."}, {"bill_id": 21683, "bill_version_id": 113016, "bill_version": "Enrolled", "bill_version_date": "2007-02-28T09:28:49-06:00",
