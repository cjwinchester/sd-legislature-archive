Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of South Dakota: Section 1. That \u00a7 32-23-4.5 be AMENDED: 32-23-4.5. Any conviction for, or plea of guilty to, an offense in another state which that, if committed in this state, would be a violation of \u00a7 22-16-41, 22-18-36, or 32-23-1, 22-18-36, or 22-16-41, and occurring within ten years prior to the date of the violation being charged, or twenty-five years if the requirements of \u00a7 32-23-4.9 have been satisfied, must be used to determine if the violation of \u00a7 32-23-1 being charged is a second, third, or subsequent offense. Section 2. That \u00a7 32-23-4.9 be AMENDED: 32-23-4.9. If a conviction for a violation of \u00a7 32-23-1 is for a sixth or subsequent offense, or subsequent offense, and the person had at least five convictions of \u00a7 32-23-1 occurring within twenty-five years of the violation being charged, and at least two of those prior convictions having occurred within ten years, the violation is an aggravated offense and the person is guilty of a Class 4 felony. If a person is convicted of an aggravated violation of \u00a7 32-23-1 and the person has at least six convictions of \u00a7 32-23-1 occurring within fifteen years of the violation being charged, the court must sentence the person to at least six years in a state correctional facility, one of which must be served on parole, unless refused pursuant to \u00a7 24-15A-15. Any term of parole must include at least one of the following: enrollment in an alcohol or drug accountability program, an ignition interlock, a breath alcohol interlock, an alcohol monitoring bracelet, or another enhanced monitoring tool. The court may suspend this sentence only if the court orders the person to participate in and complete a drug court program, DUI court program, veterans treatment court program, or mental health court program, as a condition of probation. The court, in pronouncing sentencing, shall revoke the person's driver license for a period of not less than three years from the date the sentence is imposed or three years from the date of initial release from imprisonment, whichever is later. If the person is returned to imprisonment prior to the completion of the period of driver license revocation, time spent imprisoned does not count toward fulfilling the period of revocation. If the person is convicted of driving without a license during that period, the court must sentence the person to the county jail for not less than twenty days, which sentence may not be suspended. Notwithstanding \u00a7 23A-27-19, the court retains jurisdiction to modify the conditions of the license revocation for the term of such the revocation. Upon the person's successful completion of a court-approved chemical dependency counseling program and proof of financial responsibility pursuant to \u00a7 32-35-113, the court may permit the person to operate a vehicle for the purposes of employment, 24/7 sobriety testing, attendance at school, child care delivery or pickup, or attendance at counseling programs. For each person convicted under this section and placed on probation, parole, or released from prison due to a suspended sentence, the person's supervision must include at least one of the following: enrollment in an alcohol or drug accountability program, an ignition interlock, a breath alcohol interlock, an alcohol monitoring bracelet, or another enhanced monitoring tool. The Unified Judicial System shall oversee supervision of supervise the offender if the sentence does not include a term of imprisonment in a state correctional facility. The Department of Corrections shall oversee supervision of supervise the offender if the sentence includes a term of imprisonment in a state correctional facility. Any offender supervised pursuant to this section is not excluded from earned discharge credit as otherwise authorized by statute. If, during the period of supervision imposed under this section, the person being supervised violates conditions, the person must be penalized according to the graduated sanctions policy to be as established by the Supreme Court or the Department of Corrections, respectively in chapter 23A-48. Section 3. That \u00a7 32-23-4.1 be REPEALED: Except as authorized under \u00a7 32-23-4.9, no previous conviction for, or plea of guilty to, a violation of \u00a7 32-23-1, 22-18-36, or 22-16-41 occurring more than ten years prior to the date of the violation being charged may be used to determine that the violation being charged is a second, third, or subsequent offense. Any period of time during which the defendant was incarcerated for a previous violation may not be included when calculating if the time period provided in this section has elapsed. Section 4. That \u00a7 16-22-23 be AMENDED: 16-22-23. The oversight council shall meet within ninety days after appointment and shall meet at least semiannually thereafter. The oversight council terminates five years after its first meeting, unless the Legislature, by joint resolution, continues the oversight council for a specified period of time.
