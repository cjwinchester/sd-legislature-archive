That chapter 58-5A be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: If a proposed acquisition of control requires the approval of more than one director or commissioner, the public hearing referred to in \u00a7 58-5A-10 may be held on a consolidated basis upon request of the person filing the statement referred to in \u00a7 58-5A-2, 58-5A-3, or section 2 of this Act. The statement shall be filed with the NAIC within five days of making the request for public hearing. A director or commissioner may opt out of a consolidated hearing, and shall provide notice to the applicant within ten days of the receipt of the statement. A hearing conducted on a consolidated basis shall be public and shall be held within the United States before the directors or commissioners of the states in which the insurers are domiciled. The directors or commissioners shall hear and receive evidence. A director or commissioner may attend the hearing, in person or by telecommunication. Section 23. That \u00a7 58-5A-47 be amended to read as follows: 58-5A-47. Sections The provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 58-5A-46 to 58-5A-53, inclusive, apply to any acquisition in which there is a change in control of an insurer authorized to do business in this state except the following: (1) An acquisition subject to approval or disapproval by the director pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 58-5A-2 to 58-5A-12, inclusive, 58-5A-15, 58-5A-16, 58-5A-18, 58-5A-19, and 58-5A-31; (2) A purchase of securities solely for investment purposes as long as the securities are not used by voting or otherwise to lessen the competition in any insurance market in this state to the detriment of policyholders or consumers. If a purchase of securities results in a presumption of control under pursuant to subdivision 58-5A-1(2), it is not solely for investment purposes unless the director or commissioner of the insurer's state of domicile accepts a disclaimer of control or affirmatively finds that control does not exist and the disclaimer or affirmative finding is communicated by the domiciliary director or commissioner to the director of this state; (3)(2) The acquisition of any person by another person if both persons are neither directly nor through affiliates primarily engaged in the business of insurance, if pre-acquisition notification is filed with the director in accordance with the provisions of \u00a7 58-5A-48 thirty days prior to the proposed effective date of the acquisition. Pre-acquisition notification is not required for exclusion from this subdivision if the acquisition would otherwise be excluded from this subdivision by any other subdivision of this section; (4)(3) The acquisition of already affiliated persons; (5)(4) An acquisition if, as an immediate result of the acquisition, (a) In no market would the combined market share of the involved insurers exceed five percent of the total market; (b) There would be no increase in any market share; or (c) In no market would the combined market share of the involved insurers exceed twelve percent of the total market, and the market share increase by more than two percent of the total market. For the purpose of this subdivision, a market means direct written insurance premium in this state for a line of business as contained in the annual statement required to be filed by insurers licensed to do business in this state; (6)(5) An acquisition for which a pre-acquisition notification would be required pursuant to this section due solely to the resulting effect on the ocean marine insurance line of business; and (7)(6) An acquisition of an insurer whose domiciliary director or commissioner affirmatively finds that the insurer is in failing condition; there is a lack of feasible alternatives to improving the condition; the public benefits of improving the insurer's condition through the acquisition exceed the public benefits that would arise from not lessening competition; and the findings are communicated by the domiciliary director or commissioner to the director of this state. Section 24. That \u00a7 58-5A-48 be amended to read as follows: 58-5A-48. An acquisition covered by pursuant to the provisions of \u00a7 58-5A-47 may be subject to an order pursuant to \u00a7 58-5A-69 unless the acquiring or acquired person files a pre-acquisition notification and the waiting period has expired. The director shall give confidential treatment to information submitted under this section in the same manner as provided in \u00a7 58-5A-41. The notification shall be as follows: (1) The pre-acquisition notification of this chapter shall be in a form and contain information as prescribed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners relating to those markets which, under subdivision 58-5A-47(5) 58-5A-47(4), cause the acquisition not to be exempted from the provisions of this section. The director may require additional material and information to determine whether the proposed acquisition, if consummated, would violate the competitive standard of \u00a7\u00a7 58-5A-49 and 58-5A-50. The required information may include an opinion of an economist as to the competitive impact of the acquisition in this state accompanied by a summary of the education and experience of the person indicating his ability to render an informed opinion; (2) The waiting period required shall begin on the date of receipt of the director of a pre-acquisition notification and shall end on the earlier of the thirtieth day after the date of the receipt, or termination of the waiting period by the director. Prior to the end of the waiting period, the director on a one-time basis may require the submission of additional needed information relevant to the proposed acquisition, in which event the waiting period shall end on the earlier of the thirtieth day after receipt of the additional information by the director or termination of the waiting period by the director. Section 25. That chapter 58-5A be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Any document, material, or other information in the possession or control of the NAIC, shared pursuant to this chapter, is confidential by law and privileged, is not subject to subpoena, open records laws, and is not subject to discovery or admissible as evidence in any private civil action. Section 26. That chapter 58-5A be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: If the director determines that any person fails to comply with the provisions of \u00a7 58-5A-3, 58-5A-4, 58-5A-8, 58-5A-9, 58-5A-45, or section 2 of this Act preventing the full understanding of the enterprise risk to the insurer by the affiliates or by the insurance holding company system, the violation may serve as an independent basis for disapproving dividends or distributions. The director may place the insurer under an order of supervision pursuant to the provisions of chapter 58-29B. Section 27. That \u00a7 58-5A-41 be amended to read as follows: 58-5A-41. All information, documents, and copies thereof obtained by or disclosed to the director or any other person in the course of an examination or investigation made pursuant to this chapter shall be given confidential treatment and shall not be subject to subpoena and shall not be made public by the director or any other person, except to insurance departments of other states, without the prior written consent of the insurer to which it pertains unless the director, after giving the insurer and its affiliates who would be affected thereby, notice and opportunity to be heard, determines that the interests of policyholders, shareholders or the public will be served by the publication thereof, in which event he may publish all or any part thereof in such manner as he may deem appropriate. Documents, materials, or other information including filings in the possession or control of the Division of Insurance that are obtained by or disclosed to the director or any other person in the course of an examination or investigation made pursuant to this chapter and all information reported pursuant to this chapter shall be confidential by law and privileged, are not subject to open records, freedom of information, sunshine, or other related laws, are not subject to subpoena, and are not subject to discovery or admissible in evidence in any private civil action. However, the director is authorized to use the documents, materials, or other information in the furtherance of any regulatory or legal action brought as a part of the director's official duties. The director may not otherwise make the documents, materials, or other information public without the prior written consent of the insurer to which it pertains unless the director, after giving the insurer and its affiliates who would be affected thereby notice and opportunity to be heard, determines that the interest of policyholders, shareholders, or the public will be served by the publication thereof, in which event the director may publish all or any part in such manner as may be deemed appropriate. Section 28. That chapter 58-5A be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: No waiver of any applicable privilege or claim of confidentiality in the documents, materials, or information may occur as a result of disclosure to the director pursuant to this section or as a result of sharing as authorized pursuant to this chapter."}, {"bill_id": 6298, "bill_version_id": 35146,
