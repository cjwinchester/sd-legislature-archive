Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of South Dakota: Section 1. The legislature of South Dakota finds that schoolchildren and school employees are best served by a moment of silence at the start of every school day to afford them a reprieve from the frenzy of daily life and to set a tone of decorum that will be conducive to learning. Section 2. That chapter 13-1 be amended with a NEW SECTION: Each school district shall require students and school employees to have a moment of silence lasting up to one minute each morning that school is in session. Students and school employees may engage in voluntary prayer, reflection, meditation, or other quiet, respectful activity during the moment of silence. No school employee may dictate the action to be taken by students or school employees during the moment of silence. No student may interfere with another student\u2019s engagement in the moment of silence. Nothing in this Act may be construed to permit schools to conduct the moment of silence as a religious exercise."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 22967, "action_date": "2022-01-11T12:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 226347, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/226347.pdf", "status_text": "First Reading House", "journal_page": 7, "committee_id_action": 1008, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 22967, "action_date": "2022-01-12T13:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 226713, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/226713.pdf", "status_text": "Referred to", "journal_page": 21, "committee_id_action": 1008, "committee_id_assigned": 1005, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 22967, "action_date": "2022-01-21T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 228059, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/228059.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 1005, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 22967, "action_date": "2022-01-21T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 228070, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/228070.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to the 41st legislative day", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 1005, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 71532, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [3914, 3931, 3967, 3976, 3997, 3983], "Yea": [3928, 3929, 3948, 3955, 3960, 3971, 3972, 4001, 3944]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/22967"}
