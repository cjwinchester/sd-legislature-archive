BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That subsection (g) of \u00a7 47-31A-305 be repealed. (g) The director may, by rule or order, require as a condition of registration by qualification or coordination: (1) That any security issued within the past three years or to be issued to a promoter for a consideration substantially different from the public offering price, or to any person for a consideration other than cash, be deposited in escrow; and (2) That the proceeds from the sale of the registered security in this state be impounded until the issuer receives a specified amount from the sale of security either in this state or elsewhere. The director may, by rule or order, determine the conditions of any escrow order required hereunder, but he may not reject a depository solely because of location in another state. The director may, by rule or order, require as a condition of registration that any security issued within the past three years or to be issued to a provider for a consideration substantially different from the public offering price, or to any person for a consideration other than cash, be deposited in escrow, or that the proceeds from the sale of the registered security in this state be impounded until the issuer receives a specified amount from the sale of the security either in this state or elsewhere; or he may impose both requirements. The director may, by rule or order, determine the conditions of any escrow or impounding required hereunder. If it is determined that a security has been escrowed by the director for three consecutive years after voluntary dissolution, revocation of the corporate charter, or the issuer fails to meet the terms of the escrow, the director may destroy the stock; however, the director shall maintain a permanent record of all stock destroyed. The record shall include: (1) Name of issuer; (2) Stock certificate number; (3) Number of shares represented by the certificate; (4) Name of owner of the stock certificate; and (5) CUSIP number if applicable. Section 2. That subsection (E) of \u00a7 47-31A-306 (a) be repealed. (E) The offering is being made on terms that are unfair, unjust and inequitable; Section 3. That subsection (F) of \u00a7 47-31A-306 (a) be repealed. (F) The offering has been or would be made with unreasonable amounts of underwriters' and sellers' discounts, commissions or other compensation, or promoters' profits or participation, or unreasonable amounts or kinds of options;"}, {"bill_id": 16938, "bill_version_id": 94053, "bill_version": "Enrolled", "bill_version_date": "2002-02-11T09:42:57-06:00", "bill_text": ""}], "amendments": [],
