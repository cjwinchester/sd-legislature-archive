BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. Any teacher in a South Dakota elementary or secondary public school who teaches a class to students using remote video technology is entitled to an award that is in addition to the teacher's regular salary. If the teacher teaches a class using remote video technology that is one semester in length, the award is one thousand five hundred dollars. If a teacher teaches a class using remote video technology that lasts the entire school year, the award is three thousand dollars. The Department of Education and Cultural Affairs shall pay one-third of each award. The school district that employs the teacher using the remote video technology and any other school districts that benefit from the remote class shall pay the remaining two-thirds of the award on an equal basis. Section 2. Any money that is appropriated for state aid for general education that is not expended or legally obligated shall be transferred to the remote teaching fund which is hereby created as a separate fund in the state treasury. Any money in the remote teaching fund is continuously appropriated to the Department of Education and Cultural Affairs to pay for the state's share of the awards provided by this Act. Section 3. The Department of Education and Cultural Affairs may promulgate rules, pursuant to chapter 1-26, to implement procedures to identify each teacher entitled to an award pursuant to this Act, to determine the amount of the award to which each teacher is entitled, and also to calculate and collect the amount of money owed by each affected school district. Section 4. The secretary of the Department of Education and Cultural Affairs shall approve vouchers and the state auditor shall draw warrants to pay expenditures authorized by this Act."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 18226, "action_date": "2003-01-31T13:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 96312, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/96312.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 243, "committee_id_action": 798, "committee_id_assigned": 787, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 18226, "action_date": "2003-02-06T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 96703, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/96703.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to 41st legislative day", "journal_page": 328, "committee_id_action": 787, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 56171, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [2837, 2841, 2855, 2871, 2892, 2896, 2898, 2920, 2930], "Nay": [2839, 2895, 2934, 2872], "Excused": [2857, 2877]}}, {"bill_id": 18226, "action_date": "2003-02-06T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 96703, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/96703.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 787, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/18226"}
