A public nuisance may be abated without civil action by any public body or officer as authorized thereto by law. Any private person may likewise abate a public nuisance which is specially injurious to him or any private nuisance injurious to him in any manner by removing, or, if necessary, destroying that which constitutes the nuisance, without committing a breach of the peace or doing unnecessary injury. If a private nuisance results from a mere omission of the wrongdoer, and cannot be abated without entering upon his land, reasonable notice shall be given to him before entering to abate it. Every municipality , county, or township may defray the cost of abating a public nuisance by taxing the cost thereof by special assessment against the real property on which the nuisance occurred. When If the nuisance abated is an unsafe or dilapidated building, junk, trash, debris, or similar nuisance arising from the condition of the property, the municipality , county, or township may commence a civil action against the owner of the real property for its costs of abatement in lieu of taxing the cost by special assessment. Any private person may also abate a public nuisance which is specially injurious to such person or any private nuisance injurious to such person by removing or if necessary destroying that which constitutes the nuisance without committing a breach of the peace or doing unnecessary injury. If a private nuisance results from a mere omission of the wrongdoer, and cannot be abated without entering upon the wrongdoer's land, reasonable notice shall be given to the wrongdoer before entering to abate it. Section 2. That \u00a7 22-36-1 be amended to read as follows: 22-36-1. Any person who maintains or commits any public nuisance, the punishment for which is not otherwise prescribed, or who intentionally does not perform any legal duty relating to the removal of a public nuisance, is guilty of a Class 2 misdemeanor. However, if any person has been served with personal notice by a law enforcement agency concerning the condition of such person's property and that person fails to abate the public nuisance within
