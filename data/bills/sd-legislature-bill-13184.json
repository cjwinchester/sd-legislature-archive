WHEREAS, the accumulation of sediment being deposited by the Bad River has led to a significant rise in the bed of the Missouri River as it flows through the Pierre-Fort Pierre area; and WHEREAS, this long-standing problem has resulted in a significant increase in local groundwater levels, causing a chronic, continuous problem for residents in low-lying areas of the two communities; and WHEREAS, the problem has caused several flooding incidents in southeast Pierre including a life-threatening situation on January 10, 1997, when an ice jam forced Missouri River water into streets and intersections causing damage to a variety of personal property throughout the neighborhood; and WHEREAS, high river elevations resulting from increased releases from the Oahe Dam have brought groundwater to damaging levels, flooding basements, forcing sump pumps to run continuously and lowering property values; and WHEREAS, the threat of ice jam surface flooding forces the United States Army Corps of Engineers to curtail power generation in times of greatest electric power demand; and WHEREAS, the Western Area Power Administration has indicated that demands for electric power beginning in the years 2000 to 2005 will necessitate usage of the Oahe Dam to generate electric power at times of peak demand, thereby increasing the probability and duration of ice jam-induced surface flooding; and WHEREAS, residents of southeast Pierre have joined together to form the Southeast Pierre Property Owners Association in an attempt to find intermediate and long-term solutions to these water-related problems; and WHEREAS, the Southeast Pierre Property Owners Association is now working with the state's congressional delegation, along with state and local officials, on the best possible solution to this problem; and WHEREAS, members of the Southeast Pierre Property Owners Association voted unanimously on April 7, 1997, that the association should pursue a federal legislative effort, as offered by members of the state's congressional delegation, that would require the United States Army Corps of Engineers to relocate the neighborhood and its residents: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the Senate of the Special Session of the Seventy-second Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the House of Representatives concurring therein, that the Legislature supports the efforts of the Southeast Pierre Property Owners Association, and the cities of Pierre and Fort Pierre, in their quest to find intermediate and long-term solutions to this serious problem."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 13184, "action_date": "1997-04-14T14:00:00-05:00", "document_id": 76181, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/76181.pdf", "status_text": "Adopt Resolution", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 573, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 38120, "president_vote": null, "Excused": [1989, 2013, 2060, 2065, 2084], "Yea": [1990, 1994, 1998, 2006, 2010, 2016, 2017, 2020, 2024, 2025, 2030, 2032, 2033, 2035, 2037, 2040, 2043, 2044, 2050, 2051, 2061, 2064, 2070, 2074, 2077, 2081, 2082, 2083, 2086, 2091]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/13184"}
