Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of South Dakota: Section 1. That \u00a7 22-49-1 be AMENDED: 22-49-1. No person may recruit, harbor, transport, provide, receive, purchase, or obtain, by any means, another person knowing that force, fraud, or coercion will be used to cause the person to engage in prostitution, the production of pornography, sexual exploitation as defined in \u00a7 22-22-24.3, forced labor, or involuntary servitude. No person may benefit financially or by receiving anything of value from participation in a venture that has engaged in acts set forth in this section. Any violation of this section constitutes the crime of human trafficking. If the victim is under eighteen years of age, the crime of human trafficking need not involve force, fraud, or coercion. For purposes of this section and \u00a7 22-49-3, the term, coercion, may include: (1) The use of a plan, statement, or pattern of behavior, with the intent of causing a person to believe that failure to perform an act will result in the use of physical force or violence against the person or will result in the person's restraint, isolation, confinement, or abduction; (2) Inducing a person to provide commercial sexual activity as payment toward or in satisfaction of a real or purported debt; and (3) The use of a person's physical or mental impairment, if that impairment has a substantial adverse effect on the person's cognitive or volitional function. Section 2. That \u00a7 22-49-2 be AMENDED: 22-49-2. If a person is guilty of human trafficking under \u00a7 22-49-1, and the act: (1) Involves committing or attempting to commit kidnapping; (2) Involves a victim under the age of eighteen years; (3) Involves prostitution or, procurement for prostitution, the production of pornography, or sexual exploitation as defined under \u00a7 22-22-24.3; or (4) Results in the death of a victim; the person has committed human trafficking in the first degree. A violation of the provisions of this section is a Class 2 felony. Consent to performing any act prescribed in \u00a7 22-49-1 by a minor or a minor's parent, guardian, or custodian, or any mistake as to the minor's age is not a defense to a charge of violating this section. Notwithstanding the provisions of \u00a7 22-4-1, any attempt to commit a violation of this section against a victim who is a minor is punishable in the same manner as the completed violation. Section 3. That \u00a7 22-49-3 be AMENDED: 22-49-3. A person is guilty of human trafficking in the second degree if that person: (1) Recruits, harbors, transports, provides, receives, purchases, or obtains, by any means, another person knowing that force, fraud, or coercion, as defined in \u00a7 22-49-1, will be used to cause the person to engage in prostitution, the production of pornography, sexual exploitation as defined under \u00a7 22-22-24.3, forced labor, or involuntary servitude; or (2) Benefits financially or by receiving anything of value from participation in a venture that has engaged in acts set forth in this section. Human trafficking in the second degree is a Class 4 felony. Section 4. That chapter 22-22 be amended with a NEW SECTION: A person is guilty of grooming if the person knowingly: (1) Contacts or attempts to contact a minor with the intent to gain the trust of the minor or establish a relationship for the purpose of making it more likely that the minor can later be enticed, induced, or encouraged into conduct amount to sexual exploitation as defined under \u00a7 22-22-24.3; (2) Develops a relationship or initiates communications with a minor for the purpose of having the minor engage in conduct amounting to sexual exploitation as defined under \u00a7 22-22-24.3; or (3) Exposes a minor to sexually explicit language or visual imagery for the purpose of encouraging or making it more likely that the minor will engage in conduct amounting to sexual exploitation as defined under \u00a7 22-22-24.3.
