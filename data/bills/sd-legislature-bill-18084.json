That chapter 13-43 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Any person employed to teach in a public school in this state or draw wages as a teacher shall be highly qualified. For purposes of this Act, a teacher is highly qualified if: (1) The teacher is fully licensed or certified by the Department of Education and Cultural Affairs for the subject being taught and demonstrates competency; and (2) The teacher fulfilled all of the licensure and certification requirements and no requirements were waived on an emergency, temporary, or provisional basis. Section 2. However, a school district may employ short-term substitute teachers who are not highly qualified. A short-term substitute teacher is a person hired by the school district to substitute on an intermittent basis for various highly qualified teachers. A short-term substitute teacher is not responsible for preparing lesson plans, developing curriculum, or assigning grades. No short-term substitute may provide instruction in place of the same teacher for more than twenty consecutive days."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 18084, "action_date": "2003-01-30T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 96215, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/96215.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 225, "committee_id_action": 798, "committee_id_assigned": 787, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 18084, "action_date": "2003-02-06T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 96703, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/96703.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 787, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 18084, "action_date": "2003-02-11T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 96955, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/96955.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 787, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 18084, "action_date": "2003-02-13T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 97153, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/97153.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to 41st legislative day", "journal_page": 429, "committee_id_action": 787, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 54537, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [2837, 2841, 2871, 2895, 2896, 2898, 2920, 2877, 2872], "Nay": [2839, 2855, 2930, 2934], "Excused": [2857, 2892]}}, {"bill_id": 18084, "action_date": "2003-02-13T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 97153, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/97153.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 787, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/18084"}
