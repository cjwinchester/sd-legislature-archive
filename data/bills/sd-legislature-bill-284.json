WHEREAS, climate change is one of the major challenges of the 21st century, having significant negative global environmental, economic, and social repercussions. Meeting governments' obligations on climate change will require a range of strategies, including incentives, flexible market-based approaches, and legal requirements; and WHEREAS, several states have established carbon dioxide reduction targets, either by executive order or statute, and formed climate task forces to advise on policies and strategies for meeting such targets; and WHEREAS, further targets need to be set soon in order to provide investment certainty for low-carbon energy sources, low greenhouse-gas emitting technologies, and renewable energy, and to avoid investing in incompatible energy infrastructure; and WHEREAS, South Dakota and the Midwest region can draw on the most effective aspects of other jurisdictions' experiences in crafting a coordinated, regional approach to the limiting of greenhouse gas emissions that takes advantage of our region's strengths and is environmentally effective, fair, and cost efficient; and WHEREAS, it is important to differentiate between the advantages and disadvantages of cap and trade emissions systems, which have been proposed or adopted by many government jurisdictions, and upstream carbon offset programs (UCOP), which may provide significant economic and organizational advantages in comparison with cap and trade systems; and WHEREAS, a cap and trade system establishes a cap on overall carbon emissions, usually expressed as a one-time percentage reduction to be achieved in a specified time period, often five years, with emission allowance allocations either distributed free to large emitters or auctioned out by the state; and WHEREAS, the cap and trade system is often subject to severe price distortions because of the difficulty of properly assigning emission allowance allocations, particularly in changing economic conditions over longer time periods. Cap and trade systems also involve complex planning and organizational challenges that can be avoided or minimized by market-driven approaches; and WHEREAS, an upstream carbon offset program (UCOP) is a market-driven method that sets an annual emission reduction target based on predictions of economic activity one year into the future. UCOP projections are more precise than the five-year predictions under cap and trade systems, and UCOP does not use the allowance allocations associated with cap and trade systems; and WHEREAS, a UCOP system is flexible and fully market-based, with the state playing policy-setting, regulatory, and oversight roles, rather than the more cumbersome and bureaucratic requirements necessary for the implementation of a cap and trade system; and WHEREAS, a UCOP system would allow South Dakota to institute a more efficient and flexible program than the cap and trade systems found in other jurisdictions and would ensure that investments that generate emission reductions would be made in South Dakota, rather than in other states. UCOP could benefit South Dakota's economy and boost the state's technology development; and WHEREAS, moving beyond the fossil fuel-based economy represents a historic economic opportunity. Cost-effectiveness and flexibility should be characteristics of all measures considered, with the eventual long-term goal being the development of a functioning global carbon market. South Dakota can play a significant role in these developments, both in our state and in our region: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the Senate of the Eighty-Third Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the House of Representatives concurring therein, that the South Dakota Legislature urges the development of a system for the reduction of carbon emissions and greenhouse gases through the use of market-based carbon trading models, including upstream carbon offset programs rather than cap and trade systems; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Legislature urges the State of South Dakota, the governments of surrounding states, and the Midwest Governor's Association to consider the implementation of upstream carbon trading programs in their efforts to reduce carbon greenhouse gas emissions."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 284, "action_date": "2008-02-11T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 2905, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/2905.pdf", "status_text": "First read and referred to", "journal_page": 396, "committee_id_action": 28, "committee_id_assigned": 10, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 284, "action_date": "2008-02-13T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 2911, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/2911.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 10, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 284, "action_date": "2008-02-13T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 3088, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/3088.pdf", "status_text": "Adopt Resolution", "journal_page": 480, "committee_id_action": 10, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 1805, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [557, 530, 567, 577, 588, 598], "Nay": [569, 629, 553]}}, {"bill_id": 284, "action_date": "2008-02-14T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 3229, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/3229.pdf", "status_text": "Adopt Resolution", "journal_page": 507, "committee_id_action": 28, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "F", "vote": {"vote_id": 1942, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [557, 576, 621, 553, 596, 560, 590, 598, 545, 592, 601, 582, 569, 618, 629, 613, 632, 588, 627, 548], "Yea": [604, 530, 567, 535, 533, 562, 622, 584, 573, 610, 577, 539, 550, 541, 607]}}]}
