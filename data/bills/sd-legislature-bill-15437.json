Such bond, securities, cash, or letter of credit shall be maintained unimpaired as long as the provider continues to do business in this state.

If the provider's parent company's Form 10-K is filed to meet the provider's financial stability requirement, then the parent company shall agree to guarantee the obligations of the obligor relating to service contracts sold by the provider in this state. Section 7. A provider shall maintain a funded reserve account for its liability under its contracts issued and outstanding in this state. No reserve may at any time be less than forty percent of all fees received, less claims paid, on in-force contracts. Any reserve account is subject to examination and review by the Division of Insurance upon request. Section 8. No provider may use in its name, contracts, or literature: (1) The words insurance, casualty, guarantee, or surety business; or (2) A name deceptively similar to the name or description of any insurance or surety corporation or any other provider. Section 9. A provider is considered to be the agent of the insurer that issued the reimbursement insurance policy.
