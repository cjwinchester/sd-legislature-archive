BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 58-14-7 be amended to read: 58-14-7. Credit for reinsurance shall be allowed a domestic ceding insurer as either an asset or a deduction reduction from liability on account of reinsurance ceded only when the reinsurer meets any one of the requirements of \u00a7\u00a7 58-14-8 to, 58-14-9, 58-14-10, 58-14-11, 58-14-14, inclusive or section 12 of this Act. If meeting the requirements of subdivision 58-14-10(1) \u00a7 58-14-10 or \u00a7\u00a7 58-14-11 to 58-14-13, inclusive, the requirements of subdivision 58-14-15(1) \u00a7 58-14-15 shall also be met. Credit shall be allowed under \u00a7 58-14-8, 58-14-9, or 58-14-10 only as respects cessions of those kinds or classes of business which the assuming insurer is licensed or permitted to write or assume in its state of domicile or, in the case of a United States branch of an alien assuming insurer, in the state through which it is entered and licensed to transact insurance or reinsurance. Section 2. That \u00a7 58-14-9 be amended to read: 58-14-9. Credit shall be allowed if the reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer which that is accredited as a reinsurer in this state. For a reinsurer to be accredited, it the reinsurer shall: (1) File with the director evidence of its submission to this state's jurisdiction; (2) Submit to this state's authority to examine its books and records; (3) Be licensed to transact insurance or reinsurance in at least one state, or, in the case of a United States branch of an alien assuming insurer, be entered through and licensed to transact insurance or reinsurance in at least one state; and (4) File annually with the director a copy of its annual statement filed with the insurance department of its state of domicile and a copy of its most recent audited financial statement; and (5) Demonstrate to the satisfaction of the director that the reinsurer has adequate financial capacity to meet reinsurance obligations and is otherwise qualified to assume reinsurance from domestic insurers. An assuming insurer is deemed to meet this requirement as of the time of the assuming insurer's application if the assuming insurer maintains a surplus as regards policyholders in an amount not less than twenty million dollars and the assuming insurer's accreditation has not been denied by the director within ninety days after submission of the assuming insurer's application. The director, after reviewing the documents submitted, may approve or disapprove the reinsurer. If no action is taken by the director within ninety days of the insurer's application to provide reinsurance, the reinsurer may provide reinsurance in this state if it maintains a surplus as regards policyholders in an amount which is not less than twenty million dollars. If the director approves the application, the reinsurer may do business in this state if it maintains a surplus as regards policyholders in an amount not less than one million dollars. The director may set the surplus requirements. No credit may be allowed a domestic ceding insurer if the assuming insurers' insurer's accreditation has been revoked by the director after notice and hearing. To qualify as an accredited reinsurer, an assuming insurer shall meet all of the requirements of this section. If the director determines that the assuming insurer has failed to continue to meet any of these qualifications, he may upon written notice and hearing revoke accreditation. The director may deny accreditation if the director determines that accreditation would not be in the best interest of the ceding insurer and policyholders. Section 3. That \u00a7 58-14-11 be amended to read: 58-14-11. Credit shall also be allowed if the reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer which that maintains a trust fund in a qualified United States financial institution for the payment of the valid claims of its the assuming insurer's United States policyholders and ceding insurers, their assigns and successors in interest. The assuming insurer shall report annually to the director information substantially the same as that required to be reported on the national association of insurance commissioners National Association of Insurance Commissioners annual statement form by licensed insurers to enable the director to determine the sufficiency of the trust fund. The assuming insurer shall submit to examination of the assuming insurer's books and records by the director and bear the expense of examination. Credit for reinsurance may not be granted pursuant to this section unless the form of the trust and any amendments to the trust have been approved by the commissioner of the state where the trust is domiciled, or the commissioner of another state has accepted principal regulatory oversight of the trust pursuant to the terms of the trust instrument. In the case of a single assuming insurer, the trust shall consist of a trust account equal to the assuming insurer's liabilities attributable to business written in the United States and, in addition, the assuming insurer shall maintain a trust surplus of not less than twenty million dollars. In the case of a group including incorporated and individual unincorporated underwriters, the trust shall consist of a trust account representing the group's liabilities attributable to business written in the United States and, in addition, the group shall maintain a trust surplus of which one hundred million dollars shall be held jointly for the benefit of United States ceding insurers of any member of the group. The incorporated members of the group may not engage in any business other than underwriting as a member of the group and are subject to the same level of solvency regulation and control by the group's domiciliary regulator as are the unincorporated members. The group shall make available to the director an annual certification of the solvency of each underwriter by the group's domiciliary regulator and its independent public accountants. Section 4. That chapter 58-14 be amended by adding a NEW SECTION to read: The trust fund in \u00a7 58-14-11 for a single assuming insurer shall consist of funds in trust in an amount not less than the assuming insurer's liabilities attributable to reinsurance ceded by United States ceding insurers, and, in addition, the assuming insurer shall maintain a trusteed surplus of not less than twenty million dollars, except as provided in this section. At any time after a single assuming insurer has permanently discontinued underwriting new business secured by the trust for at least three years, the director with principal regulatory oversight of the trust may authorize a reduction in the required trusteed surplus, but only after a finding, based on an assessment of the risk, that the new required surplus level is adequate for the protection of United States ceding insurers, policyholders, and claimants in light of reasonably foreseeable adverse loss development. The risk assessment may involve an actuarial review, including an independent analysis of reserves and cash flows, and shall consider all material risk factors, including when applicable the lines of business involved, the stability of the incurred loss estimates, and the effect of the surplus requirements on the assuming insurer's liquidity or solvency. The minimum required trusteed surplus may not be reduced to an amount less than thirty percent of the assuming insurer's liabilities attributable to reinsurance ceded by the United States ceding insurers covered by the trust. Section 5. That \u00a7 58-14-12 be amended to read: 58-14-12. In the case of a group of incorporated insurers underwriters, the trust in \u00a7 58-14-11 shall be in an amount equal to not less than the group's several liabilities attributable to business ceded by United States ceding insurers to any member of the group pursuant to reinsurance contracts issued in the name of the group. In addition, the group shall maintain a joint trusteed surplus of which one hundred million dollars shall be held jointly for the benefit of United States ceding insurers of any member of the group as additional security for any liabilities, and each member of the group shall make available to the director an annual certification of the member's solvency by the member's domiciliary regulator and financial statements of each underwriter member of the group prepared by its independent public accountant within ninety days after its financial statements are due to be filed with the group's domiciliary regulator. The group shall maintain a trust fund in an amount not less than the group's several liabilities attributable to business ceded by United States domiciled ceding insurers to any member of the group pursuant to reinsurance contracts issued in the name of the group. A group of incorporated insurers underwriters under this section are those under common administration which comply with the filing requirements contained in \u00a7 58-14-11, which that has continuously transacted an insurance business outside the United States for at least three years immediately prior to making application for accreditation, which that submits to this state's authority to examine its books and records and bears the expense of the examination, and which that has aggregate policyholders' surplus of at least ten billion dollars. Section 6. That chapter 58-14 be amended by adding a NEW SECTION to read: In the case of a group including incorporated and individual unincorporated underwriters, the trust in \u00a7 58-14-11 shall consist of a trusteed account in an amount not less than the respective underwriters' several liabilities attributable to business ceded by United States domiciled ceding insurers to any underwriter in the group. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this chapter, the trust in \u00a7 58-14-11 for reinsurance ceded under reinsurance agreements with an inception date on or before June 30, 1993, and not amended or renewed after that date, shall consist of a trusteed account in an amount not less than the respective underwriters' several insurance and reinsurance liabilities attributable to business written in the United States. In addition to these trusts, the group shall maintain in trust a trusteed surplus of which one hundred million dollars shall be held jointly for the benefit of United States domiciled ceding insurers of any member of the group for all years of account. The incorporated members of the group with a trust under \u00a7 58-14-11 may not be engaged in any business other than underwriting as a member of the group and shall be subject to the same level of regulation and solvency control by the group's domiciliary regulator as are the unincorporated members. Within ninety days after its financial statements are due to be filed with the group's domiciliary regulator, the group shall provide to the director an annual certification by the group's domiciliary regulator of the solvency of each underwriter member or, if a certification is unavailable, financial statements, prepared by independent public accountants, of each underwriter member of the group. Section 7. That \u00a7 58-14-13 be amended to read: 58-14-13. The trust in \u00a7\u00a7 58-14-11 and 58-14-12 shall be established in a form approved by the director. The form of the trust in \u00a7 58-14-11 and any trust amendments shall be filed with the director of each state in which the ceding insurer beneficiaries of the trust are domiciled. The trust instrument shall provide that contested claims shall be valid and enforceable upon the final order of any court of competent jurisdiction in the United States. The trust shall vest legal title to its assets in the trustees of the trust for its United States policyholders and ceding insurers, their assigns and successors in interest.

Section 8. That \u00a7 58-14-14 be amended to read: 58-14-14. Credit shall be allowed if the reinsurance is ceded to an assuming insurer not meeting the requirements of \u00a7 58-14-8, 58-14-9, 58-14-10 or \u00a7\u00a7, 58-14-11 to 58-14-13, inclusive, or section 12 of this Act but only with respect to the insurance of risks located in foreign or alien jurisdictions where the reinsurance is required by applicable law or regulation of that jurisdiction. Section 9. That \u00a7 58-14-15 be amended to read: 58-14-15. If the assuming insurer is not licensed, certified, or accredited to transact insurance or reinsurance in this state, the credit permitted by \u00a7\u00a7 58-14-10 to 58-14-13, inclusive, or 58-14-11 may not be allowed unless the assuming insurer agrees in the reinsurance agreements: (1) That in the event of the failure of the assuming insurer to perform its the assuming insurer's obligations under the terms of the reinsurance agreement, the assuming insurer, at the request of the ceding insurer, shall submit to the jurisdiction of any court of competent jurisdiction in any state of the United States, comply with all requirements necessary to give the court jurisdiction, and abide by the final decision of any court or of any appellate court in the event of an appeal; and (2) To designate the director or a designated attorney as its true and lawful attorney upon whom may be served any lawful process in any action, suit or proceeding instituted by or on behalf of the ceding company.

At any time after a single assuming insurer has permanently discontinued underwriting new business secured by the trust for at least three years, the director with principal regulatory oversight of the trust may authorize a reduction in the required trusteed surplus, but only after a finding, based on an assessment of the risk, that the new required surplus level is adequate for the protection of United States ceding insurers, policyholders, and claimants in light of reasonably foreseeable adverse loss development. The risk assessment may involve an actuarial review, including an independent analysis of reserves and cash flows, and shall consider all material risk factors, including when applicable the lines of business involved, the stability of the incurred loss estimates, and the effect of the surplus requirements on the assuming insurer's liquidity or solvency.
