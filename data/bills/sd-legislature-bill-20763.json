Upon notice of that amount by the state investment officer, the state treasurer shall transfer the amount from the education enhancement trust fund to the state general fund as soon as practicable after July first of the next fiscal year. Section 13. The state treasurer shall transfer from the state general fund an amount equal to one percent of the fair value of the education enhancement trust fund to the sparse school district fund which is hereby created in the state treasury.

In order to qualify for a grant, a school district shall submit to the department a school district improvement plan outlining the steps the district will undertake to reach adequate yearly progress, and the plan shall be approved by the secretary of education. However, no grant may be awarded to a school district in an amount that exceeds what that school district would have received if it had achieved adequate yearly progress. Section 5. There is hereby appropriated from the state general fund the sum of one million five hundred thousand dollars ($ 1,500,000 ), or so much thereof as may be necessary, to the Department of Education for distribution to sparse school districts pursuant to this Act.

At the same time that foundation program state aid is distributed to school districts pursuant to \u00a7 \u00a7 13-13-10.1 to 13-13-41, inclusive, the secretary of the Department of Education shall distribute funds to sparse school districts by multiplying either the sparsity average daily membership calculation or the sparsity adjusted average daily membership calculation in section 6 of this Act by the per student allocation as defined in \u00a7 13-13-10.1. However, no sparse school district may receive a sparsity benefit in any year that exceeds two hundred fifty thousand dollars. Section 8. Sections 6 and 7 of this Act are repealed on June 30, 2009.
