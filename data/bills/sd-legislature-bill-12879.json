Section 11. The administering insurer shall pay an agent's referral fee of twenty-five dollars to each agent who refers an applicant to the guaranteed access program if the applicant is accepted. The selling or marketing of the program plan is not limited to the administering insurer or its agents. The administering insurer shall pay the referral fees from moneys received as premiums for the program plan. Section 12. The schedule of premiums to be charged eligible persons for coverage under the program's health benefit plan may not exceed one hundred thirty-five percent of the average of the premium rates charged by the five largest insurers in this state, as determined by the director from information provided by all insurers annually. The director shall prescribe the information required and the procedure for reporting it by rules promulgated pursuant to chapter 1-26. Section 13. An eligible person may enroll in the program plan by applying to the administering insurer and paying the program plan premium to the administering insurer. The application shall include the following information: (1) The name, address, and age of the applicant; (2) The name, address, and age of any dependents who are to be insured; (3) Written evidence that the applicant was rejected for health insurance by at least one insurer within the previous six months or that restrictive riders or waiting periods for preexisting conditions were required by the insurer that substantially reduced the coverage compared with that of a person considered to be a standard risk; and (4) A designation of the coverage desired. Section 14. Within thirty days after receipt of an application for enrollment, the administering insurer shall either reject the application for failing to comply with the requirements of section 8 of this Act or forward the eligible person a notice of acceptance and billing information. Coverage is effective immediately upon receipt of the first month's premium for the plan and is retroactive to the date of the application. An eligible person may not purchase more than one policy under the program. Section 15. A person who obtains coverage under the program plan may not be covered for maternity for the first two hundred seventy days. A person may not be covered for any other preexisting condition for the first one hundred eighty days of coverage under the program plan if the person was diagnosed or treated for that condition during the ninety days immediately preceding the date of the application. The waiting periods in this section do not apply to a person being treated by nonelective procedures who has lost dependent status under a parent's or guardian's policy that was in effect for the twelve months immediately preceding the date of the application or to a person who is being treated by nonelective procedures for a congenital or genetic disease. Section 16. Coverage under this chapter terminates under the following circumstances: (1) At the request of the covered person; (2) For failure to pay the required premium, subject to a thirty-one-day grace period; (3) The lifetime maximum benefit amount has been reached; (4) The covered person qualifies for health benefits under other plans or policies; or (5) The covered person ceases to be a resident of this state. Section 17. Not less than eighty-seven and one-half percent of the program plan premium may be used to pay claims and not more than twelve and one-half percent may be used for payment of the administering insurer's direct and indirect expenses as specified in section 24 of this Act. The program shall hold at interest any income in excess of the costs incurred by the program in providing reinsurance or administrative services and shall use it to offset past and future losses due to claims or shall allocate it to reduction of premiums. Section 18. Each member of the program shall share the losses due to claims and the expenses of conducting meetings of the program and the board. The difference between the total claims expense of the program plan and the premium payments allocated to the payment of benefits is the liability of the program members. The program members shall share in the excess costs of the program plan in an amount equal to the ratio of a member's total annual premium volume for health insurance charges received from or on behalf of state residents to the total health insurance premium contract charges received by program members, as determined by the director. Each member's liability may be determined retroactively, and payment is due to the administering insurer within thirty days after notice of the assessment is given. Failure by a member to remit to the administering insurer the full amount assessed within thirty days after notice is grounds for termination of membership. Section 19. The administering insurer of the South Dakota guaranteed access program is the administering insurer of the Comprehensive Health Association of North Dakota. The administering insurer shall perform all administrative and claims payment functions for the program plan. Section 20. The administering insurer shall provide an individual certificate to all eligible persons enrolled in the program plan. The certificate shall set forth a statement of the insurance protection to which the person is entitled, the method and place of filing claims, and to whom benefits are payable. The certificate shall indicate that coverage was obtained through the program. Section 21. The administering insurer shall submit to the program and the director a semiannual report of the operation of the program plan. The board shall determine the specific information to be contained in the report before the effective date of the program plan. Section 22. The administering insurer shall publicize the existence of the guaranteed access program in this state, the eligibility requirements for the program, and the procedures for enrollment in the program and shall maintain public awareness of the program. Section 23. The administering insurer shall pay all claims pursuant to this Act and shall indicate that the claim was paid by the program plan. Each claim payment shall include information specifying the procedure for resolving a dispute over the amount of payment. Section 24. The program shall reimburse the administering insurer for its direct and indirect expenses from the premiums received for the program plan. Direct and indirect expenses include a prorated reimbursement for the portion of the administering insurer's administrative, printing, claims administration, management, and building overhead expenses which are assignable to the maintenance and administration of the program plan. The board shall approve cost accounting methods consistent with generally accepted accounting principles to substantiate the administering insurer's cost reports. Direct and indirect expenses may not include costs directly related to the original submission of policy forms prior to selection as the administering insurer. Section 25. When carrying out its duties under this Act, the administering insurer is an agent of the program and the director, and it is civilly liable for its actions, subject to the laws of this state."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 12879, "action_date": "1997-02-03T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 72894, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/72894.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 264, "committee_id_action": 544, "committee_id_assigned": 532, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 12879, "action_date": "1997-02-18T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 72384, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/72384.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 532, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 12879, "action_date": "1997-02-18T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 72384, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/72384.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass,", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 532, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "F", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 12879, "action_date": "1997-02-18T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 72384, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/72384.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass,", "journal_page": 554, "committee_id_action": 532, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 35730, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [1917, 1922, 1970, 1975, 1890, 1961, 1968], "Nay": [1894, 1941, 1973, 1988, 1904, 1967]}}, {"bill_id": 12879, "action_date": "1997-02-19T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 72918, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/72918.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to another day", "journal_page": 593, "committee_id_action": 544, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 12879, "action_date": "1997-02-20T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 72920, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/72920.pdf", "status_text": "Motion to Amend,", "journal_page": 617, "committee_id_action": 544, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 37338, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [1886, 1887, 1888, 1890, 1891, 1892, 1896, 1897, 1898, 1900, 1902, 1903, 1904, 1906, 1907, 1913, 1914, 1916, 1917, 1918, 1921, 1922, 1923, 1926, 1934, 1936, 1937, 1940, 1941, 1942, 1943, 1944, 1947, 1948, 1949, 1952, 1954, 1957, 1958, 1961, 1962, 1963, 1967, 1968, 1970, 1973, 1974, 1975, 1980, 1982, 1983, 1984, 1987, 1988, 1924], "Nay": [1894, 1895, 1909, 1910, 1929, 1931, 1933, 1950, 1951, 1953, 1966, 1985], "Absent": [1899, 1964, 1971]}}, {"bill_id": 12879, "action_date": "1997-02-20T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 72920, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/72920.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass Amended,", "journal_page": 618, "committee_id_action": 544, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "F", "vote": {"vote_id": 37385, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [1886, 1887, 1888, 1890, 1892, 1896, 1897, 1898, 1902, 1913, 1914, 1917, 1922, 1923, 1926, 1937, 1940, 1942, 1947, 1948, 1949, 1954, 1957, 1961, 1962, 1970, 1971, 1974, 1975, 1980, 1983, 1984], "Nay": [1891, 1894, 1895, 1899, 1900, 1903, 1904, 1906, 1907, 1909, 1910, 1916, 1918, 1921, 1929, 1931, 1933, 1934, 1936, 1941, 1943, 1944, 1950, 1951, 1952, 1953, 1958, 1963, 1964, 1966, 1967, 1968, 1973, 1985, 1988, 1924], "Absent": [1982], "Excused": [1987]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/12879"}
