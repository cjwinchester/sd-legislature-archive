Any insurer writing workers' compensation insurance in this state shall offer to conduct or contract for annual workplace safety review services, including review reports with written recommendations for improved safety procedures, to each of its insureds whose policy premium is five thousand dollars or more. A copy of the written recommendations shall be sent by the insurance company to the Department of Labor annually. No written recommendation prepared by an insurer pursuant to this section is subject to discovery or disclosure under chapter 15-6 or any other provision of law or admissible as evidence in any action of any kind in any court or arbitration forum. However, the recommendation may be disclosed to a subsequent insurer of the employer.
