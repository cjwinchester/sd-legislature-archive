BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 41-6-18.1 be amended to read as follows: 41-6-18.1. It is a Class 2 misdemeanor for a nonresident to hunt, take, or kill migratory waterfowl without a special nonresident waterfowl license, a fall three-day temporary nonresident waterfowl license, early fall Canada goose temporary nonresident license, or a spring snow goose temporary nonresident license, a migratory bird certification permit, and a federal migratory bird stamp, or in violation of the conditions of the licenses or the rules of the Game, Fish and Parks Commission. A special nonresident waterfowl license, except as otherwise provided in this title, entitles the licensee to hunt migratory waterfowl for ten five consecutive days. Four dollars received from the sale of each special nonresident waterfowl license shall be placed in the land acquisition and development fund. The moneys from this fund shall be used to acquire by purchase or lease real property to be used primarily for game production. This license shall be in such form as the Game, Fish and Parks Commission shall prescribe. The provision in this section limiting the validity of a special nonresident waterfowl license to ten five consecutive days does not apply in Union, Clay, Bon Homme, Yankton, and Charles Mix counties; and in such counties, the special nonresident waterfowl license is valid during the same period as is a resident waterfowl license. The Game, Fish and Parks Commission may issue no more than four two thousand special nonresident waterfowl licenses in a calendar year. Section 2. That \u00a7 41-6-18.1 be amended to read as follows: 41-6-18.1. It is a Class 2 misdemeanor for a nonresident to hunt, take, or kill migratory waterfowl without a special nonresident waterfowl license, a fall three-day temporary nonresident waterfowl license, or a spring snow goose temporary nonresident license, a migratory bird certification permit, and a federal migratory bird stamp, or in violation of the conditions of the licenses or the rules of the Game, Fish and Parks Commission. A special nonresident waterfowl license, except as otherwise provided in this title, entitles the licensee to hunt migratory waterfowl for ten five consecutive days. Four dollars received from the sale of each special nonresident waterfowl license shall be placed in the land acquisition and development fund.

The Game, Fish and Parks Commission may issue no more than four two thousand special nonresident waterfowl licenses in a calendar year. Section 3. That \u00a7 41-6-18.4 be amended to read as follows: 41-6-18.4. The Game, Fish and Parks Commission may shall promulgate rules in accordance with chapter 1-26 to authorize the department to issue up to two six thousand fall three-day temporary nonresident waterfowl licenses as provided in this section , up to two thousand early fall Canada goose temporary nonresident licenses, and a number of spring snow goose temporary nonresident licenses to be determined by the department, and to establish the fee therefor, validity of the licenses issued, types of waterfowl to be hunted, and areas in which hunting is permitted as provided in this section. The rules shall direct the department to make available for issuance six thousand fall three-day temporary nonresident waterfowl licenses, of which two thousand shall be designated for hunting in Hughes, Potter, Sully, Stanley, Lyman, and Brule counties. The other four thousand fall three-day temporary nonresident waterfowl licenses shall be available for hunting in any area of the state, including Hughes, Potter, Sully, Stanley, Lyman, and Brule counties if the two thousand licenses designated for those counties have been issued . The fall three-day temporary nonresident waterfowl licenses are valid only on private property, but are not valid on private property leased by the department for public hunting or on highways or other public rights-of-way within this state that otherwise meet the requirements of \u00a7 41-9-1.3. Revenue from the sale of fall three-day temporary nonresident waterfowl licenses shall be deposited in the department's land acquisition and development fund to be used to acquire, by lease, permit, or otherwise, interests in real property to be used for providing waterfowl hunting public access in the counties adjacent to the Missouri River . Revenue from the sale of early fall Canada goose temporary nonresident licenses shall be deposited in the department's land acquisition and development fund to be used to acquire by lease, permit, or otherwise, interests in real property to be used for providing waterfowl hunting public access. Before promulgating rules which permit the issuance of fall three-day temporary nonresident waterfowl licenses, the commission shall determine that adequate waterfowl hunting public access has been provided through the department's land acquisition and development fund or through other means. Section 4. That \u00a7 41-6-18.4 be amended to read as follows: 41-6-18.4.
