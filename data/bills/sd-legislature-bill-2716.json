WHEREAS, American agriculture has an impressive track record of successfully addressing the food, clothing, and fiber needs of a growing world population; and WHEREAS, this success has come through good management, new innovations, and scientific advancements, including proper use of biotechnology; and WHEREAS, the adoption of biotechnology by South Dakota farmers leads the nation. According to the United States Department of Agriculture National Agricultural Statistics Service, ninety-five percent of all corn and ninety-eight percent of the soybean acres planted in South Dakota in 2010 were a genetically engineered variety; and WHEREAS, in the field of agricultural biotechnology, farmers have worked closely with the seed industry to meet their stewardship obligations through contractual arrangements and other mechanisms; and WHEREAS, the United States Department of Agriculture has indicated that it may deregulate biotech alfalfa with certain conditions in an effort to address organic growers' claims of potential harm. Many South Dakota grower and agribusiness organizations strongly believe that such a conditional deregulation is not science-based and would unduly restrict or even eliminate the use of a valuable tool for growers in many parts of this country; and WHEREAS, America's farmers and ranchers have demonstrated their ability to coexist with neighboring growers, whether through neighbor-to-neighbor communications, through state seed certifying agencies, or other local, state or regional initiatives; and WHEREAS, the National Alfalfa and Forage Alliance (NAFA) developed its Best Management Practices for Roundup Ready Alfalfa Seed Production an 2008 and has taken the lead in providing coexistence documents for alfalfa hay export markets, alfalfa seed export markets, and organic alfalfa seed and hay markets; and WHEREAS, recommended best management practices were developed in South Dakota in 2007 stating that Roundup Ready Alfalfa must be harvested at or before ten percent bloom to minimize potential pollen flow from hay to common alfalfa seed production; and WHEREAS, any proposals to change United States government policy on agricultural biotechnology regulation must be done through a thoughtful dialogue inclusive of all United States government agencies: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the House of Representatives of the Eighty-sixth Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the Senate concurring therein, that the United States Secretary of Agriculture and the United States Department of Agriculture be urged to make regulatory decisions based on sound science and to deregulate biotech alfalfa and other future products as soon as possible, without unsupported conditions, to enable America's alfalfa farmers to have access to biotech alfalfa seeds in time for the spring planting season."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 2716, "action_date": "2011-01-27T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 15855, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/15855.pdf", "status_text": "First read and referred to", "journal_page": 223, "committee_id_action": 113, "committee_id_assigned": 89, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 2716, "action_date": "2011-02-03T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 16064, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/16064.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 89, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 2716, "action_date": "2011-02-03T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 16297, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/16297.pdf", "status_text": "Motion to amend", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 89, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 2716, "action_date": "2011-02-03T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 16297, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/16297.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to the 41st legislative day", "journal_page": 315, "committee_id_action": 89, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 8575, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [75, 24, 13, 31, 34, 22], "Nay": [46, 41, 25]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/2716"}
