WHEREAS, congestive heart failure is a major national public health problem that impacts five million Americans, or one and one-half percent of the national population; and WHEREAS, each year five hundred fifty thousand new cases of congestive heart failure are diagnosed, with two hundred thousand deaths and one million hospitalizations resulting from the disease; and WHEREAS, congestive heart failure is the leading cause of hospitalization in patients over the age of sixty-five; and WHEREAS, patients with congestive heart failure who are diagnosed with the most severe symptoms have an approximate fifty percent survival rate of one year, and fifty percent of patients with congestive heart failure who are diagnosed with even mild disease die within five years; and WHEREAS, the majority of patients are not diagnosed until late in the course of the disease; and WHEREAS, of an estimated ten billion dollars annual national health care expenditure for congestive heart failure the greatest portion, eight billion dollars is expended for hospitalization costs; and WHEREAS, although current treatment guidelines recommend that approximately eighty percent of heart failure patients receive angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in combination with beta blockers to extend life and reduce costly hospitalizations, only forty-five percent of patients are treated with ACE inhibitors and twenty percent of patients receive beta blockers; and WHEREAS, the primary goals of National Heart Failure Awareness Week are to promote research related to all aspects of heart failure and provide a forum for presentation of that research; to educate heart failure caregivers and patients through programs, publications, and other media allowing for more effective treatment and diagnosis of heart failure; and to enhance the quality and duration of life for those with heart failure: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the House of Representatives of the Seventy- sixth Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the Senate concurring therein, that the South Dakota Legislature endorses the national proclamation of National Heart Failure Awareness Week; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the secretary of health transmit treatment guidelines for congestive hearth failure published by the Heart Failure Society of America, Inc. to the appropriate health care professionals in the state and urge adoption of these guidelines in their practices; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that physicians and payers of health care costs be encouraged to administer and provide reimbursement for echocardiograms to all patients over fifty years of age with a history of heart disease and begin appropriate treatment as early as possible; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that physicians and payers of health care costs be encouraged to prescribe or provide reimbursement for the standard of care for congestive heart failure, including the federal Food and Drug Administration-approved beta blockers and ACE inhibitors as well as other therapies that have demonstrated a reduction in the mortality and morbidity associated with congestive heart failure; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the South Dakota Legislature endorses the inclusion of the latest treatment advances for congestive heart failure in the curriculum of the medical schools in the state."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 16685, "action_date": "2001-02-26T09:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 90814, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/90814.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 703, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 16685, "action_date": "2001-02-26T09:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 90814, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/90814.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to 41st legislative day", "journal_page": 718, "committee_id_action": 703, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 50129, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [2514, 2521, 2530, 2544, 2560, 2561, 2579, 2589, 2595, 2612, 2613, 2605, 2556]}}]}
