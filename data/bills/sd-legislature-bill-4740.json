This subdivision does not prohibit assisting a service member by providing insurer or premium information necessary to complete any allotment form; (2) Knowingly receiving funds from a service member for the payment of premium from a depository institution with which the service member has no formal banking relationship.

Examples of prohibited insurance producer titles include Battalion Insurance Counselor, Unit Insurance Advisor, Servicemen's Group Life Insurance Conversion Consultant, or Veteran's Benefits Counselor. Nothing in this subdivision prohibits a person from using a professional designation awarded after the successful completion of a course of instruction in the business of insurance by an accredited institution of higher learning.

Section 11. That chapter 58-33 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: The following acts or practices by an insurer or insurance producer regarding Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance (SGLI) or Veterans' Group Life Insurance (VGLI) are declared to be false, misleading, deceptive, or unfair: (1) Making any representation regarding the availability, suitability, amount, cost, exclusions, or limitations to coverage provided to a service member or dependents by SGLI or VGLI, which is false, misleading, or deceptive; (2) Making any representation regarding conversion requirements, including the costs of coverage, or exclusions or limitations to coverage of SGLI or VGLI to private insurers which is false, misleading or deceptive; or (3) Suggesting, recommending, or encouraging a service member to cancel or terminate his or her SGLI policy or issuing a life insurance policy which replaces an existing SGLI policy unless the replacement takes effect upon or after the service member's separation from the United States Armed Forces. Section 12. That chapter 58-33 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: The following acts or practices by an insurer and or insurance producer regarding disclosure are declared to be false, misleading, deceptive, or unfair: (1) Deploying, using, or contracting for any lead-generating materials designed exclusively for use with service members that do not clearly and conspicuously disclose that the recipient will be contacted by an insurance producer, if that is the case, for the purpose of soliciting the purchase of life insurance; (2) Failing to disclose that a solicitation for the sale of life insurance will be made when establishing a specific appointment for an in-person, face-to-face meeting with a prospective purchaser; (3) Excluding individually issued annuities, failing to clearly and conspicuously disclose the fact that the product being sold is life insurance; (4) Failing to make, at the time of sale or offer to an individual known to be a service member, the written disclosures required by section 10 of the Military Personnel Financial Services Protection Act, Pub.

The copy of the application or the written disclosure shall clearly and concisely set out the type of life insurance, the death benefit applied for and its expected first year cost. A basic illustration that meets the requirements as adopted by rule pursuant to \u00a7 58-33A-5.1 is sufficient to meet this requirement for a written disclosure. Section 13. That chapter 58-33 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: The following acts or practices by an insurer or insurance producer with respect to the sale of certain life insurance products are declared to be false, misleading, deceptive, or unfair: (1) Excluding individually issued annuities, recommending the purchase of any life insurance product which includes a side fund to a service member in pay grades E-4 and below unless the insurer has reasonable grounds for believing that the life insurance death benefit, standing alone, is suitable; (2) Offering for sale or selling a life insurance product which includes a side fund to a service member in pay grades E-4 and below who is currently enrolled in Servicemembers' Group Life Insurance (SGLI), is presumed unsuitable unless, after the completion of a needs assessment, the insurer demonstrates that the applicant's SGLI death benefit, together with any other military survivor benefits, savings and investments, survivor income, and other life insurance are insufficient to meet the applicant's insurable needs for life insurance; For the purposes of this subdivision, insurable needs, are the risks associated with premature death taking into consideration the financial obligations and immediate and future cash needs of the applicant's estate and survivors or dependents.

For this disclosure, the effective rate of return shall consider all premiums and cash contributions made by the policyholder and all cash accumulations and cash surrender values available to the policyholder in addition to life insurance coverage. This schedule shall be provided for at least each policy year from one to ten and for every fifth policy year thereafter ending at age one hundred, policy maturity, or final expiration; and (c) Which by default diverts or transfers funds accumulated in the side fund to pay, reduce or offset any premiums due; (4) Excluding individually issued annuities, offering for sale or selling any life insurance contract which after considering all policy benefits, including endowment, return of premium, or persistency, does not comply with standard nonforfeiture law for life insurance; or (5) Selling any life insurance product to a person known to be a service member that excludes coverage if the insured's death is related to war, declared or undeclared, or any act related to military service except for an accidental death coverage, which may be excluded. Section 14. The director may, by rules promulgated pursuant to chapter 1-26, adopt: (1) Revisions of the Internal Revenue Code and the regulations promulgated pursuant thereto which are in substantial compliance
