At the beginning of each month, the secretary shall make adjustments to the motor fuel tax fund balance in the following manner: (1) Each July transfer an amount to the snowmobile trails' fund equal to the product of multiplying the number of licensed snowmobiles as of July first, times one hundred twenty-five gallons, times the rate of tax provided for motor fuel under this chapter; (2) Each July transfer from the amount of motor fuel tax collected from the motor fuel used for nonhighway purposes to the value added agriculture subfund created in chapter 1-53 one hundred thirty-five thousand dollars; (3) Each July transfer from the amount of motor fuel tax collected from the motor fuel used for nonhighway purposes to the Department of Agriculture seventy-five thousand dollars to be used for a grant to the Northern Crops Institute; (4) Transfer to the motor fuel tax administration account two percent of the deposits made to the motor fuel tax fund during the preceding month to cover the expenses incurred in administering all motor fuel and special fuel tax laws of this state. On or about August first of each year, the preceding year's remaining motor fuel tax administration account balance, less an amount to provide cash flow within the account, shall be transferred to the state highway fund. The remaining balance is to be calculated by subtracting from the total of monthly deposits, the amount of corresponding expenses.
