(a) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (d), the filing of a financing statement is not necessary or effective to perfect a security interest in property subject to: (1) a statute, regulation, or treaty of the United States whose requirements for a security interest's obtaining priority over the rights of a lien creditor with respect to the property preempt Section 9-310(a); (2) a certificate-of-title statute of this State under the law of which indication of a security interest on the certificate of title is required as a condition of perfection; or (3) a certificate-of-title statute of another jurisdiction which provides for a security interest to be indicated on the certificate as a condition or result of the security interest's obtaining priority over the rights of a lien creditor with respect to the property. (b) Compliance with the requirements of a statute, regulation, or treaty described in subsection (a) for obtaining priority over the rights of a lien creditor is equivalent to the filing of a financing statement under this article. Except as otherwise provided in subsection (d) and Sections 9-313 and 9-316(d) and (e) for goods covered by a certificate of title, a security interest in property subject to a statute, regulation, or treaty described in subsection (a) may be perfected only by compliance with those requirements, and a security interest so perfected remains perfected notwithstanding a change in the use or transfer of possession of the collateral. (c) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (d) and Section 9-316(d) and (e), duration and renewal of perfection of a security interest perfected by compliance with the requirements prescribed by a statute, regulation, or treaty described in subsection (a) are governed by the statute, regulation, or treaty. In other respects, the security interest is subject to this article. (d) During any period in which collateral subject to a statute specified in subsection (a)(2) is inventory held for sale or lease by a person or leased by that person as lessor and that person is in the business of selling goods of that kind, this section does not apply to a security interest in that collateral created by that person. Section 9-312. (a) A security interest in chattel paper, negotiable documents, instruments, or investment property may be perfected by filing. (b) Except as otherwise provided in Section 9-315(c) and (d) for proceeds: (1) a security interest in a deposit account may be perfected only by control under Section 9-314; (2) and except as otherwise provided in Section 9-308(d), a security interest in a letter-of- credit right may be perfected only by control under Section 9-314; and (3) a security interest in money may be perfected only by the secured party's taking possession under Section 9-313. (c) While goods are in the possession of a bailee that has issued a negotiable document covering the goods: (1) a security interest in the goods may be perfected by perfecting a security interest in the document; and (2) a security interest perfected in the document has priority over any security interest that becomes perfected in the goods by another method during that time. (d) While goods are in the possession of a bailee that has issued a nonnegotiable document covering the goods, a security interest in the goods may be perfected by: (1) issuance of a document in the name of the secured party; (2) the bailee's receipt of notification of the secured party's interest; or (3) filing as to the goods. (e) A security interest in certificated securities, negotiable documents, or instruments is perfected without filing or the taking of possession for a period of 20 days from the time it attaches to the extent that it arises for new value given under an authenticated security agreement. (f) A perfected security interest in a negotiable document or goods in possession of a bailee, other than one that has issued a negotiable document for the goods, remains perfected for 20 days without filing if the secured party makes available to the debtor the goods or documents representing the goods for the purpose of: (1) ultimate sale or exchange; or (2) loading, unloading, storing, shipping, transshipping, manufacturing, processing, or otherwise dealing with them in a manner preliminary to their sale or exchange. (g) A perfected security interest in a certificated security or instrument remains perfected for 20 days without filing if the secured party delivers the security certificate or instrument to the debtor for the purpose of: (1) ultimate sale or exchange; or (2) presentation, collection, enforcement, renewal, or registration of transfer. (h) After the 20-day period specified in subsection (e), (f), or (g) expires, perfection depends upon compliance with this article. Section 9-313. (a) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b), a secured party may perfect a security interest in negotiable documents, goods, instruments, money, or tangible chattel paper by taking possession of the collateral. A secured party may perfect a security interest in certificated securities by taking delivery of the certificated securities under Section 8-301. (b) With respect to goods covered by a certificate of title issued by this State, a secured party may perfect a security interest in the goods by taking possession of the goods only in the circumstances described in Section 9-316(d). (c) With respect to collateral other than certificated securities and goods covered by a document, a secured party takes possession of collateral in the possession of a person other than the debtor, the secured party, or a lessee of the collateral from the debtor in the ordinary course of the debtor's business, when: (1) the person in possession authenticates a record acknowledging that it holds possession of the collateral for the secured party's benefit; or (2) the person takes possession of the collateral after having authenticated a record acknowledging that it will hold possession of collateral for the secured party's benefit. (d) If perfection of a security interest depends upon possession of the collateral by a secured party, perfection occurs no earlier than the time the secured party takes possession and continues only while the secured party retains possession. (e) A security interest in a certificated security in registered form is perfected by delivery when delivery of the certificated security occurs under Section 8-301 and remains perfected by delivery until the debtor obtains possession of the security certificate. (f) A person in possession of collateral is not required to acknowledge that it holds possession for a secured party's benefit. (g) If a person acknowledges that it holds possession for the secured party's benefit: (1) the acknowledgment is effective under subsection (c) or Section 8-301(a), even if the acknowledgment violates the rights of a debtor; and (2) unless the person otherwise agrees or law other than this article otherwise provides, the person does not owe any duty to the secured party and is not required to confirm the acknowledgment to another person. (h) A secured party having possession of collateral does not relinquish possession by delivering the collateral to a person other than the debtor or a lessee of the collateral from the debtor in the ordinary course of the debtor's business if the person was instructed before the delivery or is instructed contemporaneously with the delivery: (1) to hold possession of the collateral for the secured party's benefit; or (2) to redeliver the collateral to the secured party. (i) A secured party does not relinquish possession, even if a delivery under subsection (h) violates the rights of a debtor. A person to which collateral is delivered under subsection (h) does not owe any duty to the secured party and is not required to confirm the delivery to another person unless the person otherwise agrees or law other than this article otherwise provides. Section 9-314. (a) A security interest in investment property, deposit accounts, letter-of- credit rights, or electronic chattel paper may be perfected by control of the collateral under Section 9-104, 9-105, 9-106, or 9-107. (b) A security interest in deposit accounts, electronic chattel paper, or letter-of-credit rights is perfected by control under Section 9-104, 9-105, or 9-107 when the secured party obtains control and remains perfected by control only while the secured party retains control. (c) A security interest in investment property is perfected by control under Section 9-106 from the time the secured party obtains control and remains perfected by control until: (1) the secured party does not have control; and (2) one of the following occurs: (A) if the collateral is a certificated security, the debtor has or acquires possession of the security certificate; (B) if the collateral is an uncertificated security, the issuer has registered or registers the debtor as the registered owner; or (C) if the collateral is a security entitlement, the debtor is or becomes the entitlement holder. Section 9-315. (a) Except as otherwise provided in this article and in Section 2-403(2): (1) a security interest or agricultural lien continues in collateral notwithstanding sale, lease, license, exchange, or other disposition thereof unless the secured party authorized the disposition free of the security interest or agricultural lien; and (2) a security interest attaches to any identifiable proceeds of collateral. (b) Proceeds that are commingled with other property are identifiable proceeds: (1) if the proceeds are goods, to the extent provided by Section 9-336; and (2) if the proceeds are not goods, to the extent that the secured party identifies the proceeds by a method of tracing, including application of equitable principles, that is permitted under law other than this article with respect to commingled property of the type involved. (c) A security interest in proceeds is a perfected security interest if the security interest in the original collateral was perfected. (d) A perfected security interest in proceeds becomes unperfected on the 21st day after the security interest attaches to the proceeds unless: (1) the following conditions are satisfied: (A) a filed financing statement covers the original collateral; (B) the proceeds are collateral in which a security interest may be perfected by filing in the office in which the financing statement has been filed; and (C) the proceeds are not acquired with cash proceeds; (2) the proceeds are identifiable cash proceeds; or (3) the security interest in the proceeds is perfected other than under subsection (c) when the security interest attaches to the proceeds or within 20 days thereafter. (e) If a filed financing statement covers the original collateral, a security interest in proceeds which remains perfected under subsection (d)(1) becomes unperfected at the later of: (1) when the effectiveness of the filed financing statement lapses under Section 9-515 or is terminated under Section 9-513; or (2) the 21st day after the security interest attaches to the proceeds. Section 9-316. (a) A security interest perfected pursuant to the law of the jurisdiction designated in Section 9-301(1) or 9-305(c) remains perfected until the earliest of: (1) the time perfection would have ceased under the law of that jurisdiction; (2) the expiration of four months after a change of the debtor's location to another jurisdiction; or (3) the expiration of one year after a transfer of collateral to a person that thereby becomes a debtor and is located in another jurisdiction. (b) If a security interest described in subsection (a) becomes perfected under the law of the other jurisdiction before the earliest time or event described in that subsection, it remains perfected thereafter. If the security interest does not become perfected under the law of the other jurisdiction before the earliest time or event, it becomes unperfected and is deemed never to have been perfected as against a purchaser of the collateral for value. (c) A possessory security interest in collateral, other than goods covered by a certificate of title and as-extracted collateral consisting of goods, remains continuously perfected if: (1) the collateral is located in one jurisdiction and subject to a security interest perfected under the law of that jurisdiction; (2) thereafter the collateral is brought into another jurisdiction; and (3) upon entry into the other jurisdiction, the security interest is perfected under the law of the other jurisdiction. (d) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (e), a security interest in goods covered by a certificate of title which is perfected by any method under the law of another jurisdiction when the goods become covered by a certificate of title from this State remains perfected until the security interest would have become unperfected under the law of the other jurisdiction had the goods not become so covered. (e) A security interest described in subsection (d) becomes unperfected as against a purchaser of the goods for value and is deemed never to have been perfected as against a purchaser of the goods for value if the applicable requirements for perfection under Section 9-311(b) or 9-313 are not satisfied before the earlier of: (1) the time the security interest would have become unperfected under the law of the other jurisdiction had the goods not become covered by a certificate of title from this State; or (2) the expiration of four months after the goods had become so covered. (f) A security interest in deposit accounts, letter-of-credit rights, or investment property which is perfected under the law of the bank's jurisdiction, the issuer's jurisdiction, a nominated person's jurisdiction, the securities intermediary's jurisdiction, or the commodity intermediary's jurisdiction, as applicable, remains perfected until the earlier of: (1) the time the security interest would have become unperfected under the law of that jurisdiction; or (2) the expiration of four months after a change of the applicable jurisdiction to another jurisdiction. (g) If a security interest described in subsection (f) becomes perfected under the law of the other jurisdiction before the earlier of the time or the end of the period described in that subsection, it remains perfected thereafter. If the security interest does not become perfected under the law of the other jurisdiction before the earlier of that time or the end of that period, it becomes unperfected and is deemed never to have been perfected as against a purchaser of the collateral for value. Section 9-317. (a) A security interest or agricultural lien is subordinate to the rights of: (1) a person entitled to priority under Section 9-322; and (2) except as otherwise provided in subsection (e), a person that becomes a lien creditor before the earlier of the time: (A) the security interest or agricultural lien is perfected; or (B) one of the conditions specified in Section 9-203(b)(3) is met and a financing statement covering the collateral is filed. (b) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (e), a buyer, other than a secured party, of tangible chattel paper, documents, goods, instruments, or a security certificate takes free of a security interest or agricultural lien if the buyer gives value and receives delivery of the collateral without knowledge of the security interest or agricultural lien and before it is perfected. (c) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (e), a lessee of goods takes free of a security interest or agricultural lien if the lessee gives value and receives delivery of the collateral without knowledge of the security interest or agricultural lien and before it is perfected. (d) A licensee of a general intangible or a buyer, other than a secured party, of accounts, electronic chattel paper, general intangibles, or investment property other than a certificated security takes free of a security interest if the licensee or buyer gives value without knowledge of the security interest and before it is perfected. (e) Except as otherwise provided in Sections 9-320 and 9-321, if a person files a financing statement with respect to a purchase-money security interest before or within 20 days after the debtor receives delivery of the collateral, the security interest takes priority over the rights of a buyer, lessee, or lien creditor which arise between the time the security interest attaches and the time of filing. Section 9-318. (a) A debtor that has sold an account, chattel paper, payment intangible, or promissory note does not retain a legal or equitable interest in the collateral sold. (b) For purposes of determining the rights of creditors of, and purchasers for value of an account or chattel paper from, a debtor that has sold an account or chattel paper, while the buyer's security interest is unperfected, the debtor is deemed to have rights and title to the account or chattel paper identical to those the debtor sold. Section 9-319. (a) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b), for purposes of determining the rights of creditors of, and purchasers for value of goods from, a consignee, while the goods are in the possession of the consignee, the consignee is deemed to have rights and title to the goods identical to those the consignor had or had power to transfer. (b) For purposes of determining the rights of a creditor of a consignee, law other than this article determines the rights and title of a consignee while goods are in the consignee's possession if, under this part, a perfected security interest held by the consignor would have priority over the rights of the creditor. Section 9-320. (a) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (e), a buyer in ordinary course of business, other than a person buying farm products from a person engaged in farming operations, takes free of a security interest created by the buyer's seller, even if the security interest is perfected and the buyer knows of its existence. (b) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (e), a buyer of goods from a person who used or bought the goods for use primarily for personal, family, or household purposes takes free of a security interest, even if perfected, if the buyer buys: (1) without knowledge of the security interest; (2) for value; (3) primarily for the buyer's personal, family, or household purposes; and (4) before the filing of a financing statement covering the goods. (c) To the extent that it affects the priority of a security interest over a buyer of goods under subsection (b), the period of effectiveness of a filing made in the jurisdiction in which the seller is located is governed by Section 9-316(a) and (b). (d) A buyer in ordinary course of business buying oil, gas, or other minerals at the wellhead or minehead or after extraction takes free of an interest arising out of an encumbrance. (e) Subsections (a) and (b) do not affect a security interest in goods in the possession of the secured party under Section 9-313. Section 9-321. (a) In this section, \"licensee in ordinary course of business\" means a person that becomes a licensee of a general intangible in good faith, without knowledge that the license violates the rights of another person in the general intangible, and in the ordinary course from a person in the business of licensing general intangibles of that kind. A person becomes a licensee in the ordinary course if the license to the person comports with the usual or customary practices in the kind of business in which the licensor is engaged or with the licensor's own usual or customary practices. (b) A licensee in ordinary course of business takes its rights under a nonexclusive license free of a security interest in the general intangible created by the licensor, even if the security interest is perfected and the licensee knows of its existence. (c) A lessee in ordinary course of business takes its leasehold interest free of a security interest in the goods created by the lessor, even if the security interest is perfected and the lessee knows of its existence. Section 9-322. (a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, priority among conflicting security interests and agricultural liens in the same collateral is determined according to the following rules: (1) Conflicting perfected security interests and agricultural liens rank according to priority in time of filing or perfection. Priority dates from the earlier of the time a filing covering the collateral is first made or the security interest or agricultural lien is first perfected, if there is no period thereafter when there is neither filing nor perfection. (2) A perfected security interest or agricultural lien has priority over a conflicting unperfected security interest or agricultural lien. (3) The first security interest or agricultural lien to attach or become effective has priority if conflicting security interests and agricultural liens are unperfected. (b) For the purposes of subsection (a)(1): (1) the time of filing or perfection as to a security interest in collateral is also the time of filing or perfection as to a security interest in proceeds; and (2) the time of filing or perfection as to a security interest in collateral supported by a supporting obligation is also the time of filing or perfection as to a security interest in the supporting obligation. (c) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (f), a security interest in collateral which qualifies for priority over a conflicting security interest under Section 9-327, 9-328, 9-329, 9-330, or 9-331 also has priority over a conflicting security interest in: (1) any supporting obligation for the collateral; and (2) proceeds of the collateral if: (A) the security interest in proceeds is perfected; (B) the proceeds are cash proceeds or of the same type as the collateral; and (C) in the case of proceeds that are proceeds of proceeds, all intervening proceeds are cash proceeds, proceeds of the same type as the collateral, or an account relating to the collateral. (d) Subject to subsection (e) and except as otherwise provided in subsection (f), if a security interest in chattel paper, deposit accounts, negotiable documents, instruments, investment property, or letter-of-credit rights is perfected by a method other than filing, conflicting perfected security interests in proceeds of the collateral rank according to priority in time of filing. (e) Subsection (d) applies only if the proceeds of the collateral are not cash proceeds, chattel paper, negotiable documents, instruments, investment property, or letter-of-credit rights. (f) Subsections (a) through (e) are subject to: (1) subsection (g) and the other provisions of this part; (2) Section 4-210 with respect to a security interest of a collecting bank; (3) Section 5-118 with respect to a security interest of an issuer or nominated person; and (4) Section 9-110 with respect to a security interest arising under Article 2 or 2A. (g) A perfected agricultural lien on collateral has priority over a conflicting security interest in or agricultural lien on the same collateral if the statute creating the agricultural lien so provides. Section 9-323. (a) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c), for purposes of determining the priority of a perfected security interest under Section 9-322(a)(1), perfection of the security interest dates from the time an advance is made to the extent that the security interest secures an advance that: (1) is made while the security interest is perfected only: (A) under Section 9-309 when it attaches; or (B) temporarily under Section 9-312(e), (f), or (g); and (2) is not made pursuant to a commitment entered into before or while the security interest is perfected by a method other than under Section 9-309 or 9-312(e), (f), or (g). (b) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c), a security interest is subordinate to the rights of a person that becomes a lien creditor to the extent that the security interest secures an advance made more than 45 days after the person becomes a lien creditor unless the advance is made: (1) without knowledge of the lien; or (2) pursuant to a commitment entered into without knowledge of the lien. (c) Subsections (a) and (b) do not apply to a security interest held by a secured party that is a buyer of accounts, chattel paper, payment intangibles, or promissory notes or a consignor. (d) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (e), a buyer of goods other than a buyer in ordinary course of business takes free of a security interest to the extent that it secures advances made after the earlier of: (1) the time the secured party acquires knowledge of the buyer's purchase; or (2) 45 days after the purchase. (e) Subsection (d) does not apply if the advance is made pursuant to a commitment entered into without knowledge of the buyer's purchase and before the expiration of the 45-day period. (f) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (g), a lessee of goods, other than a lessee in ordinary course of business, takes the leasehold interest free of a security interest to the extent that it secures advances made after the earlier of: (1) the time the secured party acquires knowledge of the lease; or (2) 45 days after the lease contract becomes enforceable. (g) Subsection (f) does not apply if the advance is made pursuant to a commitment entered into without knowledge of the lease and before the expiration of the 45-day period. Section 9-324. (a) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (g), a perfected purchase- money security interest in goods other than inventory or livestock has priority over a conflicting security interest in the same goods, and, except as otherwise provided in Section 9-327, a perfected security interest in its identifiable proceeds also has priority, if the purchase-money security interest is perfected when the debtor receives possession of the collateral or within 20 days thereafter. (b) Subject to subsection (c) and except as otherwise provided in subsection (g), a perfected purchase-money security interest in inventory has priority over a conflicting security interest in the same inventory, has priority over a conflicting security interest in chattel paper or an instrument constituting proceeds of the inventory and in proceeds of the chattel paper, if so provided in Section 9-330, and, except as otherwise provided in Section 9-327, also has priority in identifiable cash proceeds of the inventory to the extent the identifiable cash proceeds are received on or before the delivery of the inventory to a buyer, if: (1) the purchase-money security interest is perfected when the debtor receives possession of the inventory; (2) the purchase-money secured party sends an authenticated notification to the holder of the conflicting security interest; (3) the holder of the conflicting security interest receives the notification within five years before the debtor receives possession of the inventory; and (4) the notification states that the person sending the notification has or expects to acquire a purchase-money security interest in inventory of the debtor and describes the inventory. (c) Subsections (b)(2) through (4) apply only if the holder of the conflicting security interest had filed a financing statement covering the same types of inventory: (1) if the purchase-money security interest is perfected by filing, before the date of the filing; or (2) if the purchase-money security interest is temporarily perfected without filing or possession under Section 9-312(f), before the beginning of the 20-day period thereunder. (d) Subject to subsection (e) and except as otherwise provided in subsection (g), a perfected purchase-money security interest in livestock that are farm products has priority over a conflicting security interest in the same livestock, and, except as otherwise provided in Section 9-327, a perfected security interest in their identifiable proceeds and identifiable products in their unmanufactured states also has priority, if: (1) the purchase-money security interest is perfected when the debtor receives possession of the livestock; (2) the purchase-money secured party sends an authenticated notification to the holder of the conflicting security interest; (3) the holder of the conflicting security interest receives the notification within six months before the debtor receives possession of the livestock; and (4) the notification states that the person sending the notification has or expects to acquire a purchase-money security interest in livestock of the debtor and describes the livestock. (e) Subsections (d)(2) through (4) apply only if the holder of the conflicting security interest had filed a financing statement covering the same types of livestock: (1) if the purchase-money security interest is perfected by filing, before the date of the filing; or (2) if the purchase-money security interest is temporarily perfected without filing or possession under Section 9-312(f), before the beginning of the 20-day period thereunder. (f) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (g), a perfected purchase-money security interest in software has priority over a conflicting security interest in the same collateral, and, except as otherwise provided in Section 9-327, a perfected security interest in its identifiable proceeds also has priority, to the extent that the purchase-money security interest in the goods in which the software was acquired for use has priority in the goods and proceeds of the goods under this section. (g) If more than one security interest qualifies for priority in the same collateral under subsection (a), (b), (d), or (f): (1) a security interest securing an obligation incurred as all or part of the price of the collateral has priority over a security interest securing an obligation incurred for value given to enable the debtor to acquire rights in or the use of collateral; and (2) in all other cases, Section 9-322(a) applies to the qualifying security interests. Section 9-325. (a) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b), a security interest created by a debtor is subordinate to a security interest in the same collateral created by another person if: (1) the debtor acquired the collateral subject to the security interest created by the other person; (2) the security interest created by the other person was perfected when the debtor acquired the collateral; and (3) there is no period thereafter when the security interest is unperfected. (b) Subsection (a) subordinates a security interest only if the security interest: (1) otherwise would have priority solely under Section 9-322(a) or 9-324; or (2) arose solely under Section 2-711(3) or 2A-508(5). Section 9-326. (a) Subject to subsection (b), a security interest created by a new debtor which is perfected by a filed financing statement that is effective solely under Section 9-508 in collateral in which a new debtor has or acquires rights is subordinate to a security interest in the same collateral which is perfected other than by a filed financing statement that is effective solely under Section 9-508. (b) The other provisions of this part determine the priority among conflicting security interests in the same collateral perfected by filed financing statements that are effective solely under Section 9-508. However, if the security agreements to which a new debtor became bound as debtor were not entered into by the same original debtor, the conflicting security interests rank according to priority in time of the new debtor's having become bound. Section 9-327. The following rules govern priority among conflicting security interests in the same deposit account: (1) A security interest held by a secured party having control of the deposit account under Section 9-104 has priority over a conflicting security interest held by a secured party that does not have control. (2) Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (3) and (4), security interests perfected by control under Section 9-314 rank according to priority in time of obtaining control. (3) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (4), a security interest held by the bank with which the deposit account is maintained has priority over a conflicting security interest held by another secured party. (4) A security interest perfected by control under Section 9-104(a)(3) has priority over a security interest held by the bank with which the deposit account is maintained. Section 9-328. The following rules govern priority among conflicting security interests in the same investment property: (1) A security interest held by a secured party having control of investment property under Section 9-106 has priority over a security interest held by a secured party that does not have control of the investment property. (2) Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (3) and (4), conflicting security interests held by secured parties each of which has control under Section 9-106 rank according to priority in time of: (A) if the collateral is a security, obtaining control; (B) if the collateral is a security entitlement carried in a securities account and: (i) if the secured party obtained control under Section 8-106(d)(1), the secured party's becoming the person for which the securities account is maintained; (ii) if the secured party obtained control under Section 8-106(d)(2), the securities intermediary's agreement to comply with the secured party's entitlement orders with respect to security entitlements carried or to be carried in the securities account; or (iii) if the secured party obtained control through another person under Section 8-106(d)(3), the time on which priority would be based under this paragraph if the other person were the secured party; or (C) if the collateral is a commodity contract carried with a commodity intermediary, the satisfaction of the requirement for control specified in Section 9-106(b)(2) with respect to commodity contracts carried or to be carried with the commodity intermediary. (3) A security interest held by a securities intermediary in a security entitlement or a securities account maintained with the securities intermediary has priority over a conflicting security interest held by another secured party. (4) A security interest held by a commodity intermediary in a commodity contract or a commodity account maintained with the commodity intermediary has priority over a conflicting security interest held by another secured party. (5) A security interest in a certificated security in registered form which is perfected by taking delivery under Section 9-313(a) and not by control under Section 9-314 has priority over a conflicting security interest perfected by a method other than control. (6) Conflicting security interests created by a broker, securities intermediary, or commodity intermediary which are perfected without control under Section 9-106 rank equally. (7) In all other cases, priority among conflicting security interests in investment property is governed by Sections 9-322 and 9-323. Section 9-329. The following rules govern priority among conflicting security interests in the same letter-of-credit right: (1) A security interest held by a secured party having control of the letter-of-credit right under Section 9-107 has priority to the extent of its control over a conflicting security interest held by a secured party that does not have control. (2) Security interests perfected by control under Section 9-314 rank according to priority in time of obtaining control. Section 9-330. (a) A purchaser of chattel paper has priority over a security interest in the chattel paper which is claimed merely as proceeds of inventory subject to a security interest if: (1) in good faith and in the ordinary course of the purchaser's business, the purchaser gives new value and takes possession of the chattel paper or obtains control of the chattel paper under Section 9-105; and (2) the chattel paper does not indicate that it has been assigned to an identified assignee other than the purchaser. (b) A purchaser of chattel paper has priority over a security interest in the chattel paper which is claimed other than merely as proceeds of inventory subject to a security interest if the purchaser gives new value and takes possession of the chattel paper or obtains control of the chattel paper under Section 9-105 in good faith, in the ordinary course of the purchaser's business, and without knowledge that the purchase violates the rights of the secured party. (c) Except as otherwise provided in Section 9-327, a purchaser having priority in chattel paper under subsection (a) or (b) also has priority in proceeds of the chattel paper to the extent that: (1) Section 9-322 provides for priority in the proceeds; or (2) the proceeds consist of the specific goods covered by the chattel paper or cash proceeds of the specific goods, even if the purchaser's security interest in the proceeds is unperfected. (d) Except as otherwise provided in Section 9-331(a), a purchaser of an instrument has priority over a security interest in the instrument perfected by a method other than possession if the purchaser gives value and takes possession of the instrument in good faith and without knowledge that the purchase violates the rights of the secured party. (e) For purposes of subsections (a) and (b), the holder of a purchase-money security interest in inventory gives new value for chattel paper constituting proceeds of the inventory. (f) For purposes of subsections (b) and (d), if chattel paper or an instrument indicates that it has been assigned to an identified secured party other than the purchaser, a purchaser of the chattel paper or instrument has knowledge that the purchase violates the rights of the secured party. Section 9-331. (a) This article does not limit the rights of a holder in due course of a negotiable instrument, a holder to which a negotiable document of title has been duly negotiated, or a protected purchaser of a security. These holders or purchasers take priority over an earlier security interest, even if perfected, to the extent provided in Articles 3, 7, and 8. (b) This article does not limit the rights of or impose liability on a person to the extent that the person is protected against the assertion of a claim under Article 8. (c) Filing under this article does not constitute notice of a claim or defense to the holders, or purchasers, or persons described in subsections (a) and (b). Section 9-332. (a) A transferee of money takes the money free of a security interest unless the transferee acts in collusion with the debtor in violating the rights of the secured party. (b) A transferee of funds from a deposit account takes the funds free of a security interest in the deposit account unless the transferee acts in collusion with the debtor in violating the rights of the secured party. Section 9-333. (a) In this section, \"possessory lien\" means an interest, other than a security interest or an agricultural lien: (1) which secures payment or performance of an obligation for services or materials furnished with respect to goods by a person in the ordinary course of the person's business; (2) which is created by statute or rule of law in favor of the person; and (3) whose effectiveness depends on the person's possession of the goods. (b) A possessory lien on goods has priority over a security interest in the goods unless the lien is created by a statute that expressly provides otherwise. Section 9-334. (a) A security interest under this article may be created in goods that are fixtures or may continue in goods that become fixtures. A security interest does not exist under this article in ordinary building materials incorporated into an improvement on land. (b) This article does not prevent creation of an encumbrance upon fixtures under real property law. (c) In cases not governed by subsections (d) through (h), a security interest in fixtures is subordinate to a conflicting interest of an encumbrancer or owner of the related real property other than the debtor. (d) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h), a perfected security interest in fixtures has priority over a conflicting interest of an encumbrancer or owner of the real property if the debtor has an interest of record in or is in possession of the real property and: (1) the security interest is a purchase-money security interest; (2) the interest of the encumbrancer or owner arises before the goods become fixtures; and (3) the security interest is perfected by a fixture filing before the goods become fixtures or within 20 days thereafter. (e) A perfected security interest in fixtures has priority over a conflicting interest of an encumbrancer or owner of the real property if: (1) the debtor has an interest of record in the real property or is in possession of the real property and the security interest: (A) is perfected by a fixture filing before the interest of the encumbrancer or owner is of record; and (B) has priority over any conflicting interest of a predecessor in title of the encumbrancer or owner; (2) before the goods become fixtures, the security interest is perfected by any method permitted by this article and the fixtures are readily removable: (A) factory or office machines; (B) equipment that is not primarily used or leased for use in the operation of the real property; or (C) replacements of domestic appliances that are consumer goods; (3) the conflicting interest is a lien on the real property obtained by legal or equitable proceedings after the security interest was perfected by any method permitted by this article; or (4) the security interest is: (A) created in a manufactured home in a manufactured-home transaction; and (B) perfected pursuant to a statute described in Section 9-311(a)(2). (f) A security interest in fixtures, whether or not perfected, has priority over a conflicting interest of an encumbrancer or owner of the real property if: (1) the encumbrancer or owner has, in an authenticated record, consented to the security interest or disclaimed an interest in the goods as fixtures; or (2) the debtor has a right to remove the goods as against the encumbrancer or owner. (g) The priority of the security interest under paragraph (f)(2) continues for a reasonable time if the debtor's right to remove the goods as against the encumbrancer or owner terminates. (h) A mortgage is a construction mortgage to the extent that it secures an obligation incurred for the construction of an improvement on land, including the acquisition cost of the land, if a recorded record of the mortgage so indicates. Except as otherwise provided in subsections (e) and (f), a security interest in fixtures is subordinate to a construction mortgage if a record of the mortgage is recorded before the goods become fixtures and the goods become fixtures before the completion of the construction. A mortgage has this priority to the same extent as a construction mortgage to the extent that it is given to refinance a construction mortgage. (i) A perfected security interest in crops growing on real property has priority over a conflicting interest of an encumbrancer or owner of the real property if the debtor has an interest of record in or is in possession of the real property. (j) Subsection (i) prevails over any inconsistent statute. Section 9-335. (a) A security interest may be created in an accession and continues in collateral that becomes an accession. (b) If a security interest is perfected when the collateral becomes an accession, the security interest remains perfected in the collateral. (c) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (d), the other provisions of this part determine the priority of a security interest in an accession. (d) A security interest in an accession is subordinate to a security interest in the whole which is perfected by compliance with the requirements of a certificate-of-title statute under Section 9-311(b). (e) After default, subject to Part 6, a secured party may remove an accession from other goods if the security interest in the accession has priority over the claims of every person having an interest in the whole. (f) A secured party that removes an accession from other goods under subsection (e) shall promptly reimburse any holder of a security interest or other lien on, or owner of, the whole or of the other goods, other than the debtor, for the cost of repair of any physical injury to the whole or the other goods. The secured party need not reimburse the holder or owner for any diminution in value of the whole or the other goods caused by the absence of the accession removed or by any necessity for replacing it. A person entitled to reimbursement may refuse permission to remove until the secured party gives adequate assurance for the performance of the obligation to reimburse. Section 9-336. (a) In this section, \"commingled goods\" means goods that are physically united with other goods in such a manner that their identity is lost in a product or mass. (b) A security interest does not exist in commingled goods as such. However, a security interest may attach to a product or mass that results when goods become commingled goods. (c) If collateral becomes commingled goods, a security interest attaches to the product or mass. (d) If a security interest in collateral is perfected before the collateral becomes commingled goods, the security interest that attaches to the product or mass under subsection (c) is perfected. (e) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (f), the other provisions of this part determine the priority of a security interest that attaches to the product or mass under subsection (c). (f) If more than one security interest attaches to the product or mass under subsection (c), the following rules determine priority: (1) A security interest that is perfected under subsection (d) has priority over a security interest that is unperfected at the time the collateral becomes commingled goods. (2) If more than one security interest is perfected under subsection (d), the security interests rank equally in proportion to the value of the collateral at the time it became commingled goods. Section 9-337. If, while a security interest in goods is perfected by any method under the law of another jurisdiction, this State issues a certificate of title that does not show that the goods are subject to the security interest or contain a statement that they may be subject to security interests not shown on the certificate: (1) a buyer of the goods, other than a person in the business of selling goods of that kind, takes free of the security interest if the buyer gives value and receives delivery of the goods after issuance of the certificate and without knowledge of the security interest; and (2) the security interest is subordinate to a conflicting security interest in the goods that attaches, and is perfected under Section 9-311(b), after issuance of the certificate and without the conflicting secured party's knowledge of the security interest. Section 9-338. If a security interest or agricultural lien is perfected by a filed financing statement providing information described in Section 9-516(b)(5) which is incorrect at the time the financing statement is filed: (1) the security interest or agricultural lien is subordinate to a conflicting perfected security interest in the collateral to the extent that the holder of the conflicting security interest gives value in reasonable reliance upon the incorrect information; and (2) a purchaser, other than a secured party, of the collateral takes free of the security interest or agricultural lien to the extent that, in reasonable reliance upon the incorrect information, the purchaser gives value and, in the case of chattel paper, documents, goods, instruments, or a security certificate, receives delivery of the collateral. Section 9-339. This article does not preclude subordination by agreement by a person entitled to priority. Section 9-340. (a) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c), a bank with which a deposit account is maintained may exercise any right of recoupment or set-off against a secured party that holds a security interest in the deposit account. (b) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c), the application of this article to a security interest in a deposit account does not affect a right of recoupment or set-off of the secured party as to a deposit account maintained with the secured party. (c) The exercise by a bank of a set-off against a deposit account is ineffective against a secured party that holds a security interest in the deposit account which is perfected by control under Section 9-104(a)(3), if the set-off is based on a claim against the debtor. Section 9-341. Except as otherwise provided in Section 9-340(c), and unless the bank otherwise agrees in an authenticated record, a bank's rights and duties with respect to a deposit account maintained with the bank are not terminated, suspended, or modified by: (1) the creation, attachment, or perfection of a security interest in the deposit account; (2) the bank's knowledge of the security interest; or (3) the bank's receipt of instructions from the secured party. Section 9-342. This article does not require a bank to enter into an agreement of the kind described in Section 9-104(a)(2), even if its customer so requests or directs. A bank that has entered into such an agreement is not required to confirm the existence of the agreement to another person unless requested to do so by its customer. Section 9-401. (a) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b) and Sections 9-406, 9-407, 9-408, and 9-409, whether a debtor's rights in collateral may be voluntarily or involuntarily transferred is governed by law other than this article. (b) An agreement between the debtor and secured party which prohibits a transfer of the debtor's rights in collateral or makes the transfer a default does not prevent the transfer from taking effect. Section 9-402. The existence of a security interest, agricultural lien, or authority given to a debtor to dispose of or use collateral, without more, does not subject a secured party to liability in contract or tort for the debtor's acts or omissions. Section 9-403. (a) In this section, \"value\" has the meaning provided in Section 3-303(a). (b) Except as otherwise provided in this section, an agreement between an account debtor and an assignor not to assert against an assignee any claim or defense that the account debtor may have against the assignor is enforceable by an assignee that takes an assignment: (1) for value; (2) in good faith; (3) without notice of a claim of a property or possessory right to the property assigned; and (4) without notice of a defense or claim in recoupment of the type that may be asserted against a person entitled to enforce a negotiable instrument under Section 3-305(a). (c) Subsection (b) does not apply to defenses of a type that may be asserted against a holder in due course of a negotiable instrument under Section 3-305(b). (d) In a consumer transaction, if a record evidences the account debtor's obligation, law other than this article requires that the record include a statement to the effect that the rights of an assignee are subject to claims or defenses that the account debtor could assert against the original obligee, and the record does not include such a statement: (1) the record has the same effect as if the record included such a statement; and (2) the account debtor may assert against an assignee those claims and defenses that would have been available if the record included such a statement. (e) This section is subject to law other than this article which establishes a different rule for an account debtor who is an individual and who incurred the obligation primarily for personal, family, or household purposes. (f) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (d), this section does not displace law other than this article which gives effect to an agreement by an account debtor not to assert a claim or defense against an assignee. Section 9-404. (a) Unless an account debtor has made an enforceable agreement not to assert defenses or claims, and subject to subsections (b) through (e), the rights of an assignee are subject to: (1) all terms of the agreement between the account debtor and assignor and any defense or claim in recoupment arising from the transaction that gave rise to the contract; and (2) any other defense or claim of the account debtor against the assignor which accrues before the account debtor receives a notification of the assignment authenticated by the assignor or the assignee. (b) Subject to subsection (c) and except as otherwise provided in subsection (d), the claim of an account debtor against an assignor may be asserted against an assignee under subsection (a) only to reduce the amount the account debtor owes. (c) This section is subject to law other than this article which establishes a different rule for an account debtor who is an individual and who incurred the obligation primarily for personal, family, or household purposes. (d) In a consumer transaction, if a record evidences the account debtor's obligation, law other than this article requires that the record include a statement to the effect that the account debtor's recovery against an assignee with respect to claims and defenses against the assignor may not exceed amounts paid by the account debtor under the record, and the record does not include such a statement, the extent to which a claim of an account debtor against the assignor may be asserted against an assignee is determined as if the record included such a statement. (e) This section does not apply to an assignment of a health-care-insurance receivable. Section 9-405. (a) A modification of or substitution for an assigned contract is effective against an assignee if made in good faith. The assignee acquires corresponding rights under the modified or substituted contract. The assignment may provide that the modification or substitution is a breach of contract by the assignor. This subsection is subject to subsections (b) through (d). (b) Subsection (a) applies to the extent that: (1) the right to payment or a part thereof under an assigned contract has not been fully earned by performance; or (2) the right to payment or a part thereof has been fully earned by performance and the account debtor has not received notification of the assignment under Section 9-406(a). (c) This section is subject to law other than this article which establishes a different rule for an account debtor who is an individual and who incurred the obligation primarily for personal, family, or household purposes. (d) This section does not apply to an assignment of a health-care-insurance receivable. Section 9-406. (a) Subject to subsections (b) through (i), an account debtor on an account, chattel paper, or a payment intangible may discharge its obligation by paying the assignor until, but not after, the account debtor receives a notification, authenticated by the assignor or the assignee, that the amount due or to become due has been assigned and that payment is to be made to the assignee. After receipt of the notification, the account debtor may discharge its obligation by paying the assignee and may not discharge the obligation by paying the assignor. (b) Subject to subsection (h), notification is ineffective under subsection (a): (1) if it does not reasonably identify the rights assigned; (2) to the extent that an agreement between an account debtor and a seller of a payment intangible limits the account debtor's duty to pay a person other than the seller and the limitation is effective under law other than this article; or (3) at the option of an account debtor, if the notification notifies the account debtor to make less than the full amount of any installment or other periodic payment to the assignee, even if: (A) only a portion of the account, chattel paper, or payment intangible has been assigned to that assignee; (B) a portion has been assigned to another assignee; or (C) the account debtor knows that the assignment to that assignee is limited. (c) Subject to subsection (h), if requested by the account debtor, an assignee shall seasonably furnish reasonable proof that the assignment has been made. Unless the assignee complies, the account debtor may discharge its obligation by paying the assignor, even if the account debtor has received a notification under subsection (a). (d) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (e) and Sections 2A-303 and 9-407, and subject to subsection (h), a term in an agreement between an account debtor and an assignor or in a promissory note is ineffective to the extent that it: (1) prohibits, restricts, or requires the consent of the account debtor or person obligated on the promissory note to the assignment or transfer of, or the creation, attachment, perfection, or enforcement of a security interest in, the account, chattel paper, payment intangible, or promissory note; or (2) provides that the assignment or transfer or the creation, attachment, perfection, or enforcement of the security interest may give rise to a default, breach, right of recoupment, claim, defense, termination, right of termination, or remedy under the account, chattel paper, payment intangible, or promissory note. (e) Subsection (d) does not apply to the sale of a payment intangible or promissory note. (f) Except as otherwise provided in Sections 2A-303 and 9-407 and subject to subsections (h) and (i), a rule of law, statute, or regulation that prohibits, restricts, or requires the consent of a government, governmental body or official, or account debtor to the assignment or transfer of, or creation of a security interest in, an account or chattel paper is ineffective to the extent that the rule of law, statute, or regulation: (1) prohibits, restricts, or requires the consent of the government, governmental body or official, or account debtor to the assignment or transfer of, or the creation, attachment, perfection, or enforcement of a security interest in the account or chattel paper; or (2) provides that the assignment or transfer or the creation, attachment, perfection, or enforcement of the security interest may give rise to a default, breach, right of recoupment, claim, defense, termination, right of termination, or remedy under the account or chattel paper. (g) Subject to subsection (h), an account debtor may not waive or vary its option under subsection (b)(3). (h) This section is subject to law other than this article which establishes a different rule for an account debtor who is an individual and who incurred the obligation primarily for personal, family, or household purposes. (i) This section does not apply to an assignment of a health-care-insurance receivable. (j) This section prevails over any inconsistent statute. Section 9-407. (a) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b), a term in a lease agreement is ineffective to the extent that it: (1) prohibits, restricts, or requires the consent of a party to the lease to the assignment or transfer of, or the creation, attachment, perfection, or enforcement of a security interest in, an interest of a party under the lease contract or in the lessor's residual interest in the goods; or (2) provides that the assignment or transfer or the creation, attachment, perfection, or enforcement of the security interest may give rise to a default, breach, right of recoupment, claim, defense, termination, right of termination, or remedy under the lease. (b) Except as otherwise provided in Section 2A-303(7), a term described in subsection (a)(2) is effective to the extent that there is: (1) a transfer by the lessee of the lessee's right of possession or use of the goods in violation of the term; or (2) a delegation of a material performance of either party to the lease contract in violation of the term. (c) The creation, attachment, perfection, or enforcement of a security interest in the lessor's interest under the lease contract or the lessor's residual interest in the goods is not a transfer that materially impairs the lessee's prospect of obtaining return performance or materially changes the duty of or materially increases the burden or risk imposed on the lessee within the purview of Section 2A-303(4) unless, and then only to the extent that, enforcement actually results in a delegation of material performance of the lessor. Section 9-408. (a) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b), a term in a promissory note or in an agreement between an account debtor and a debtor which relates to a health-care- insurance receivable or a general intangible, including a contract, permit, license, or franchise, and which term prohibits, restricts, or requires the consent of the person obligated on the promissory note or the account debtor to, the assignment or transfer of, or creation, attachment, or perfection of a security interest in, the promissory note, health-care-insurance receivable, or general intangible, is ineffective to the extent that the term: (1) would impair the creation, attachment, or perfection of a security interest; or (2) provides that the assignment or transfer or the creation, attachment, or perfection of the security interest may give rise to a default, breach, right of recoupment, claim, defense, termination, right of termination, or remedy under the promissory note, health-care-insurance receivable, or general intangible. (b) Subsection (a) applies to a security interest in a payment intangible or promissory note only if the security interest arises out of a sale of the payment intangible or promissory note. (c) A rule of law, statute, or regulation that prohibits, restricts, or requires the consent of a government, governmental body or official, person obligated on a promissory note, or account debtor to the assignment or transfer of, or creation of a security interest in, a promissory note, health-care-insurance receivable, or general intangible, including a contract, permit, license, or franchise between an account debtor and a debtor, is ineffective to the extent that the rule of law, statute, or regulation: (1) would impair the creation, attachment, or perfection of a security interest; or (2) provides that the assignment or transfer or the creation, attachment, or perfection of the security interest may give rise to a default, breach, right of recoupment, claim, defense, termination, right of termination, or remedy under the promissory note, health-care-insurance receivable, or general intangible. (d) To the extent that a term in a promissory note or in an agreement between an account debtor and a debtor which relates to a health-care-insurance receivable or general intangible or a rule of law, statute, or regulation described in subsection (c) would be effective under law other than this article but is ineffective under subsection (a) or (c), the creation, attachment, or perfection of a security interest in the promissory note, health-care-insurance receivable, or general intangible: (1) is not enforceable against the person obligated on the promissory note or the account debtor; (2) does not impose a duty or obligation on the person obligated on the promissory note or the account debtor; (3) does not require the person obligated on the promissory note or the account debtor to recognize the security interest, pay or render performance to the secured party, or accept payment or performance from the secured party; (4) does not entitle the secured party to use or assign the debtor's rights under the promissory note, health-care-insurance receivable, or general intangible, including any related information or materials furnished to the debtor in the transaction giving rise to the promissory note, health-care-insurance receivable, or general intangible; (5) does not entitle the secured party to use, assign, possess, or have access to any trade secrets or confidential information of the person obligated on the promissory note or the account debtor; and (6) does not entitle the secured party to enforce the security interest in the promissory note, health-care-insurance receivable, or general intangible. (e) This section prevails over any inconsistent statute. Section 9-409. (a) A term in a letter of credit or a rule of law, statute, regulation, custom, or practice applicable to the letter of credit which prohibits, restricts, or requires the consent of an applicant, issuer, or nominated person to a beneficiary's assignment of or creation of a security interest in a letter-of-credit right is ineffective to the extent that the term or rule of law, statute, regulation, custom, or practice: (1) would impair the creation, attachment, or perfection of a security interest in the letter- of-credit right; or (2) provides that the assignment or the creation, attachment, or perfection of the security interest may give rise to a default, breach, right of recoupment, claim, defense, termination, right of termination, or remedy under the letter-of-credit right. (b) To the extent that a term in a letter of credit is ineffective under subsection (a) but would be effective under law other than this article or a custom or practice applicable to the letter of credit, to the transfer of a right to draw or otherwise demand performance under the letter of credit, or to the assignment of a right to proceeds of the letter of credit, the creation, attachment, or perfection of a security interest in the letter-of-credit right: (1) is not enforceable against the applicant, issuer, nominated person, or transferee beneficiary; (2) imposes no duties or obligations on the applicant, issuer, nominated person, or transferee beneficiary; and (3) does not require the applicant, issuer, nominated person, or transferee beneficiary to recognize the security interest, pay or render performance to the secured party, or accept payment or other performance from the secured party. Section 9-501. (a) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b), if the local law of this State governs perfection of a security interest or agricultural lien, the office in which to file a financing statement to perfect the security interest or agricultural lien is: (1) the office designated for the filing or recording of a record of a mortgage on the related real property, if: (A) the collateral is as-extracted collateral or timber to be cut; or (B) the financing statement is filed as a fixture filing and the collateral is goods that are or are to become fixtures; or (2) the office of the secretary of state, in all other cases, including a case in which the collateral is goods that are or are to become fixtures and the financing statement is not filed as a fixture filing. (b) The office in which to file a financing statement to perfect a security interest in collateral, including fixtures, of a transmitting utility is the office of the secretary of state. The financing statement also constitutes a fixture filing as to the collateral indicated in the financing statement which is or is to become fixtures. Section 9-501.1. All statements to continue, release, assign, amend or terminate any financing statements filed subsequent to December 31, 1979, and prior to July 1, 1980, notwithstanding any noncompliance with \u00a7 57A-9-401.1 as amended, are hereby cured, legalized and validated as fully as if such filings had been made in full compliance with \u00a7 57A-9-401.1. Section 9-502. (a) Subject to subsection (b), a financing statement is sufficient only if it: (1) provides the name of the debtor and either the social security number or the internal revenue service taxpayer identification number of the debtor; (2) provides the name of the secured party or a representative of the secured party; and (3) indicates the collateral covered by the financing statement. (b) Except as otherwise provided in Section 9-501(b), to be sufficient, a financing statement that covers as-extracted collateral or timber to be cut, or which is filed as a fixture filing and covers goods that are or are to become fixtures, must satisfy subsection (a) and also: (1) indicate that it covers this type of collateral; (2) indicate that it is to be filed for record in the real property records; (3) provide a description of the real property to which the collateral is related sufficient to give constructive notice of a mortgage under the law of this State if the description were contained in a record of the mortgage of the real property. A financing statement covering timber to be cut or covering minerals or the like (including oil and gas) or accounts subject to Section 9-301, or a financing statement filed as a fixture filing where the debtor is not a transmitting utility, must show that it covers this type of collateral, must recite that it is to be filed for record in the real estate records, and the financing statement must contain a description of the real estate sufficient if it were contained in a mortgage of the real estate to give constructive notice of the mortgage under the law of this state. If the debtor does not have an interest of record in the real estate, the financing statement must show the name of a record owner. No description of the real estate or the name of the record owner thereof is required for a fixture filing where the debtor is a transmitting utility; and (4) if the debtor does not have an interest of record in the real property, provide the name of a record owner. (c) A record of a mortgage is effective, from the date of recording, as a financing statement filed as a fixture filing or as a financing statement covering as-extracted collateral or timber to be cut only if: (1) the record indicates the goods or accounts that it covers; (2) the goods are or are to become fixtures related to the real property described in the record or the collateral is related to the real property described in the record and is as- extracted collateral or timber to be cut; (3) the record satisfies the requirements for a financing statement in this section other than an indication that it is to be filed in the real property records; and (4) the record is recorded. (d) A financing statement may be filed before a security agreement is made or a security interest otherwise attaches. Section 9-503. (a) A financing statement sufficiently provides the name of the debtor: (1) if the debtor is a registered organization, only if the financing statement provides the name of the debtor indicated on the public record of the debtor's jurisdiction of organization which shows the debtor to have been organized; (2) if the debtor is a decedent's estate, only if the financing statement provides the name of the decedent and indicates that the debtor is an estate; (3) if the debtor is a trust or a trustee acting with respect to property held in trust, only if the financing statement: (A) provides the name specified for the trust in its organic documents or, if no name is specified, provides the name of the settlor and additional information sufficient to distinguish the debtor from other trusts having one or more of the same settlors; and (B) indicates, in the debtor's name or otherwise, that the debtor is a trust or is a trustee acting with respect to property held in trust; and (4) in other cases: (A) if the debtor has a name, only if it provides the individual or organizational name of the debtor; and (B) if the debtor does not have a name, only if it provides the names of the partners, members, associates, or other persons comprising the debtor. (b) A financing statement that provides the name of the debtor in accordance with subsection (a) is not rendered ineffective by the absence of: (1) a trade name or other name of the debtor; or (2) unless required under subsection (a)(4)(B), names of partners, members, associates, or other persons comprising the debtor. (c) A financing statement that provides only the debtor's trade name does not sufficiently provide the name of the debtor. (d) Failure to indicate the representative capacity of a secured party or representative of a secured party does not affect the sufficiency of a financing statement. (e) A financing statement may provide the name of more than one debtor and the name of more than one secured party. Section 9-504. A financing statement sufficiently indicates the collateral that it covers if the financing statement provides: (1) a description of the collateral pursuant to Section 9-108; or (2) an indication that the financing statement covers all assets or all personal property. Section 9-505. (a) A consignor, lessor, or other bailor of goods, a licensor, or a buyer of a payment intangible or promissory note may file a financing statement, or may comply with a statute or treaty described in Section 9-311(a), using the terms \"consignor\", \"consignee\", \"lessor\", \"lessee\", \"bailor\", \"bailee\", \"licensor\", \"licensee\", \"owner\", \"registered owner\", \"buyer\", \"seller\", or words of similar import, instead of the terms \"secured party\" and \"debtor\". (b) This part applies to the filing of a financing statement under subsection (a) and, as appropriate, to compliance that is equivalent to filing a financing statement under Section 9-311(b), but the filing or compliance is not of itself a factor in determining whether the collateral secures an obligation. If it is determined for another reason that the collateral secures an obligation, a security interest held by the consignor, lessor, bailor, licensor, owner, or buyer which attaches to the collateral is perfected by the filing or compliance. Section 9-506. (a) A financing statement substantially satisfying the requirements of this part is effective, even if it has minor errors or omissions, unless the errors or omissions make the financing statement seriously misleading. (b) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c), a financing statement that fails sufficiently to provide the name of the debtor in accordance with Section 9-503(a) is seriously misleading. (c) If a search of the records of the filing office under the debtor's correct name, using the filing office's standard search logic, if any, would disclose a financing statement that fails sufficiently to provide the name of the debtor in accordance with Section 9-503(a), the name provided does not make the financing statement seriously misleading. (d) For purposes of Section 9-508(b), the \"debtor's correct name\" in subsection (c) means the correct name of the new debtor. Section 9-507. (a) A filed financing statement remains effective with respect to collateral that is sold, exchanged, leased, licensed, or otherwise disposed of and in which a security interest or agricultural lien continues, even if the secured party knows of or consents to the disposition. (b) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c) and Section 9-508, a financing statement is not rendered ineffective if, after the financing statement is filed, the information provided in the financing statement becomes seriously misleading under Section 9-506. (c) If a debtor so changes its name that a filed financing statement becomes seriously misleading under Section 9-506: (1) the financing statement is effective to perfect a security interest in collateral acquired by the debtor before, or within four months after, the change; and (2) the financing statement is not effective to perfect a security interest in collateral acquired by the debtor more than four months after the change, unless an amendment to the financing statement which renders the financing statement not seriously misleading is filed within four months after the change. Section 9-508. (a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, a filed financing statement naming an original debtor is effective to perfect a security interest in collateral in which a new debtor has or acquires rights to the extent that the financing statement would have been effective had the original debtor acquired rights in the collateral. (b) If the difference between the name of the original debtor and that of the new debtor causes a filed financing statement that is effective under subsection (a) to be seriously misleading under Section 9-506: (1) the financing statement is effective to perfect a security interest in collateral acquired by the new debtor before, and within four months after, the new debtor becomes bound under Section 9-203(d); and (2) the financing statement is not effective to perfect a security interest in collateral acquired by the new debtor more than four months after the new debtor becomes bound under Section 9-203(d) unless an initial financing statement providing the name of the new debtor is filed before the expiration of that time. (c) This section does not apply to collateral as to which a filed financing statement remains effective against the new debtor under Section 9-507(a). Section 9-509. (a) A person may file an initial financing statement, amendment that adds collateral covered by a financing statement, or amendment that adds a debtor to a financing statement only if: (1) the debtor authorizes the filing in an authenticated record or pursuant to subsection (b) or (c); or (2) the person holds an agricultural lien that has become effective at the time of filing and the financing statement covers only collateral in which the person holds an agricultural lien. (b) By authenticating or becoming bound as debtor by a security agreement, a debtor or new debtor authorizes the filing of an initial financing statement, and an amendment, covering: (1) the collateral described in the security agreement; and (2) property that becomes collateral under Section 9-315(a)(2), whether or not the security agreement expressly covers proceeds. (c) By acquiring collateral in which a security interest or agricultural lien continues under Section 9-315(a)(1), a debtor authorizes the filing of an initial financing statement, and an amendment, covering the collateral and property that becomes collateral under Section 9- 315(a)(2). (d) A person may file an amendment other than an amendment that adds collateral covered by a financing statement or an amendment that adds a debtor to a financing statement only if: (1) the secured party of record authorizes the filing; or (2) the amendment is a termination statement for a financing statement as to which the secured party of record has failed to file or send a termination statement as required by Section 9-513(a) or (c), the debtor authorizes the filing, and the termination statement indicates that the debtor authorized it to be filed. (e) If there is more than one secured party of record for a financing statement, each secured party of record may authorize the filing of an amendment under subsection (d). Section 9-510. (a) A filed record is effective only to the extent that it was filed by a person that may file it under Section 9-509. (b) A record authorized by one secured party of record does not affect the financing statement with respect to another secured party of record. (c) A continuation statement that is not filed within the six-month period prescribed by Section 9-515(d) is ineffective. Section 9-511. (a) A secured party of record with respect to a financing statement is a person whose name is provided as the name of the secured party or a representative of the secured party in an initial financing statement that has been filed. If an initial financing statement is filed under Section 9-514(a), the assignee named in the initial financing statement is the secured party of record with respect to the financing statement. (b) If an amendment of a financing statement which provides the name of a person as a secured party or a representative of a secured party is filed, the person named in the amendment is a secured party of record. If an amendment is filed under Section 9-514(b), the assignee named in the amendment is a secured party of record. (c) A person remains a secured party of record until the filing of an amendment of the financing statement which deletes the person. Section 9-512. (a) Subject to Section 9-509, a person may add or delete collateral covered by, continue or terminate the effectiveness of, or, subject to subsection (e), otherwise amend the information provided in, a financing statement by filing an amendment that: (1) identifies, by its file number, the initial financing statement to which the amendment relates and either the social security number or internal revenue service taxpayer identification number of the debtor; and (2) if the amendment relates to an initial financing statement filed or recorded in a filing office described in Section 9-501(a)(1), provides the date and time that the initial financing statement was filed or recorded and the information specified in Section 9- 502(b). (b) Except as otherwise provided in Section 9-515, the filing of an amendment does not extend the period of effectiveness of the financing statement. (c) A financing statement that is amended by an amendment that adds collateral is effective as to the added collateral only from the date of the filing of the amendment. (d) A financing statement that is amended by an amendment that adds a debtor is effective as to the added debtor only from the date of the filing of the amendment. (e) An amendment is ineffective to the extent it: (1) purports to delete all debtors and fails to provide the name of a debtor to be covered by the financing statement; or (2) purports to delete all secured parties of record and fails to provide the name of a new secured party of record. Section 9-513. (a) A secured party shall cause the secured party of record for a financing statement to file a termination statement for the financing statement if the financing statement covers consumer goods and: (1) there is no obligation secured by the collateral covered by the financing statement and no commitment to make an advance, incur an obligation, or otherwise give value; or (2) the debtor did not authorize the filing of the initial financing statement. (b) To comply with subsection (a), a secured party shall cause the secured party of record to file the termination statement: (1) within one month after there is no obligation secured by the collateral covered by the financing statement and no commitment to make an advance, incur an obligation, or otherwise give value; or (2) if earlier, within 20 days after the secured party receives an authenticated demand from a debtor. (c) In cases not governed by subsection (a), within 20 days after a secured party receives an authenticated demand from a debtor, the secured party shall cause the secured party of record for a financing statement to send to the debtor a termination statement for the financing statement or file the termination statement in the filing office if: (1) except in the case of a financing statement covering accounts or chattel paper that has been sold or goods that are the subject of a consignment, there is no obligation secured by the collateral covered by the financing statement and no commitment to make an advance, incur an obligation, or otherwise give value; (2) the financing statement covers accounts or chattel paper that has been sold but as to which the account debtor or other person obligated has discharged its obligation; (3) the financing statement covers goods that were the subject of a consignment to the debtor but are not in the debtor's possession; or (4) the debtor did not authorize the filing of the initial financing statement. (d) Except as otherwise provided in Section 9-510, upon the filing of a termination statement with the filing office, the financing statement to which the termination statement relates ceases to be effective. Except as otherwise provided in Section 9-510, for purposes of Sections 9- 519(g), 9-522(a), and 9-523(c), the filing with the filing office of a termination statement relating to a financing statement that indicates that the debtor is a transmitting utility also causes the effectiveness of the financing statement to lapse. Section 9-514. (a) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c), an initial financing statement may reflect an assignment of all of the secured party's power to authorize an amendment to the financing statement by providing the name and mailing address of the assignee as the name and address of the secured party. (b) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c), a secured party of record may assign of record all or part of its power to authorize an amendment to a financing statement by filing in the filing office an amendment of the financing statement which: (1) identifies, by its file number, the initial financing statement to which it relates; (2) provides the name of the assignor; and (3) provides the name and mailing address of the assignee. (c) An assignment of record of a security interest in a fixture covered by a record of a mortgage which is effective as a financing statement filed as a fixture filing under Section 9-502(c) may be made only by an assignment of record of the mortgage in the manner provided by law of this State other than the Uniform Commercial Code. Section 9-515. (a) Except as otherwise provided in subsections (b), (e), (f), and (g), a filed financing statement is effective for a period of five years after the date of filing. Financing statements filed before July 1, 1997, are effective for a period of five years from the date of filing and thereafter for a period of 60 days. The expiration date established by a financing statement filed prior to July 1, 1997, whether or not continued by a continuation statement shall remain in full force and effect and is not diminished by any subsequent amendments to this Act. (b) Except as otherwise provided in subsections (e), (f), and (g), an initial financing statement filed in connection with a public-finance transaction or manufactured-home transaction is effective for a period of 30 years after the date of filing if it indicates that it is filed in connection with a public-finance transaction or manufactured-home transaction. (c) The effectiveness of a filed financing statement lapses on the expiration of the period of its effectiveness unless before the lapse a continuation statement is filed pursuant to subsection (d). Upon lapse, a financing statement ceases to be effective and any security interest or agricultural lien that was perfected by the financing statement becomes unperfected, unless the security interest is perfected otherwise. If the security interest or agricultural lien becomes unperfected upon lapse, it is deemed never to have been perfected as against a purchaser of the collateral for value. (d) A continuation statement may be filed only within six months before the expiration of the five-year period specified in subsection (a) or the 30-year period specified in subsection (b), whichever is applicable. However, for financing statements filed before July 1, 1997, a continuation statement may be filed within six months before and 60 days after the expiration of the five-year period. (e) Except as otherwise provided in Section 9-510, upon timely filing of a continuation statement, the effectiveness of the initial financing statement continues for a period of five years commencing on the day on which the financing statement would have become ineffective in the absence of the filing. Upon the expiration of the five-year period, the financing statement lapses in the same manner as provided in subsection (c), unless, before the lapse, another continuation statement is filed pursuant to subsection (d). Succeeding continuation statements may be filed in the same manner to continue the effectiveness of the initial financing statement. (f) If a debtor is a transmitting utility and a filed financing statement so indicates, the financing statement is effective until a termination statement is filed. (g) A record of a mortgage that is effective as a financing statement filed as a fixture filing under Section 9-502(c) remains effective as a financing statement filed as a fixture filing until the mortgage is released or satisfied of record or its effectiveness otherwise terminates as to the real property. Section 9-516. (a) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b), communication of a record to a filing office and tender of the filing fee or acceptance of the record by the filing office constitutes filing. (b) Filing does not occur with respect to a record that a filing office refuses to accept because: (1) the record is not communicated by a method or medium of communication authorized by the filing office; (2) an amount equal to or greater than the applicable filing fee is not tendered; (3) the filing office is unable to index the record because: (A) in the case of an initial financing statement, the record does not provide a name for the debtor; (B) in the case of an amendment or correction statement, the record: (i) does not identify the initial financing statement as required by Section 9-512 or 9-518, as applicable; or (ii) identifies an initial financing statement whose effectiveness has lapsed under Section 9-515; (C) in the case of an initial financing statement that provides the name of a debtor identified as an individual or an amendment that provides a name of a debtor identified as an individual which was not previously provided in the financing statement to which the record relates, the record does not identify the debtor's last name; or (D) in the case of a record filed or recorded in the filing office described in Section 9-501(a)(1), the record does not provide a sufficient description of the real property to which it relates; (4) in the case of an initial financing statement or an amendment that adds a secured party of record, the record does not provide a name and mailing address for the secured party of record; (5) in the case of an initial financing statement or an amendment that provides a name of a debtor which was not previously provided in the financing statement to which the amendment relates, the record does not: (A) provide a mailing address for the debtor; (B) indicate whether the debtor is an individual or an organization; or (C) if the financing statement indicates that the debtor is an organization, provide: (i) a type of organization for the debtor; (ii) a jurisdiction of organization for the debtor; or (iii) an organizational identification number for the debtor or indicate that the debtor has none; (6) in the case of an assignment reflected in an initial financing statement under Section 9-514(a) or an amendment filed under Section 9-514(b), the record does not provide a name and mailing address for the assignee; or (7) in the case of a continuation statement, the record is not filed within the six-month period prescribed by Section 9-515(d). (c) For purposes of subsection (b): (1) a record does not provide information if the filing office is unable to read or decipher the information; and (2) a record that does not indicate that it is an amendment or identify an initial financing statement to which it relates, as required by Section 9-512, 9-514, or 9-518, is an initial financing statement. (d) A record that is communicated to the filing office with tender of the filing fee, but which the filing office refuses to accept for a reason other than one set forth in subsection (b), is effective as a filed record except as against a purchaser of the collateral which gives value in reasonable reliance upon the absence of the record from the files. Section 9-517. The failure of the filing office to index a record correctly does not affect the effectiveness of the filed record. Section 9-518. (a) A person may file in the filing office a correction statement with respect to a record indexed there under the person's name if the person believes that the record is inaccurate or was wrongfully filed. (b) A correction statement must: (1) identify the record to which it relates by: (A) the file number assigned to the initial financing statement to which the record relates; and (B) if the correction statement relates to a record filed or recorded in a filing office described in Section 9-501(a)(1), the date and time that the initial financing statement was filed or recorded and the information specified in Section 9- 502(b); (2) indicate that it is a correction statement; and (3) provide the basis for the person's belief that the record is inaccurate and indicate the manner in which the person believes the record should be amended to cure any inaccuracy or provide the basis for the person's belief that the record was wrongfully filed. (c) The filing of a correction statement does not affect the effectiveness of an initial financing statement or other filed record. Section 9-519. (a) For each record filed in a filing office, the filing office shall: (1) assign a unique number to the filed record; (2) create a record that bears the number assigned to the filed record and the date and time of filing; (3) maintain the filed record for public inspection; and (4) index the filed record in accordance with subsections (c), (d), and (e). (b) A file number assigned after July 1, 2001, must include a digit that: (1) is mathematically derived from or related to the other digits of the file number; and (2) aids the filing office in determining whether a number communicated as the file number includes a single-digit or transpositional error. (c) Except as otherwise provided in subsections (d) and (e), the filing office shall: (1) index an initial financing statement according to the name of the debtor and index all filed records relating to the initial financing statement in a manner that associates with one another an initial financing statement and all filed records relating to the initial financing statement; and (2) index a record that provides a name of a debtor which was not previously provided in the financing statement to which the record relates also according to the name that was not previously provided. (d) If a financing statement is filed as a fixture filing or covers as-extracted collateral or timber to be cut, it must be filed for record and the filing office shall index it: (1) under the names of the debtor and of each owner of record shown on the financing statement as if they were the mortgagors under a mortgage of the real property described; and (2) to the extent that the law of this State provides for indexing of records of mortgages under the name of the mortgagee, under the name of the secured party as if the secured party were the mortgagee thereunder, or, if indexing is by description, as if the financing statement were a record of a mortgage of the real property described. (e) If a financing statement is filed as a fixture filing or covers as-extracted collateral or timber to be cut, the filing office shall index an assignment filed under Section 9-514(a) or an amendment filed under Section 9-514(b): (1) under the name of the assignor as grantor; and (2) to the extent that the law of this State provides for indexing a record of the assignment of a mortgage under the name of the assignee, under the name of the assignee. (f) The filing office shall maintain a capability: (1) to retrieve a record by the name of the debtor and: (A) if the filing office is described in Section 9-501(a)(1), by the file number assigned to the initial financing statement to which the record relates and the date and time that the record was filed or recorded; or (B) if the filing office is described in Section 9-501(a)(2), by the file number assigned to the initial financing statement to which the record relates; and (2) to associate and retrieve with one another an initial financing statement and each filed record relating to the initial financing statement. (g) The filing office may not remove a debtor's name from the index until one year after the effectiveness of a financing statement naming the debtor lapses under Section 9-515 with respect to all secured parties of record. (h) The filing office shall perform the acts required by subsections (a) through (e) at the time and in the manner prescribed by filing-office rule, but not later than two business days after the filing office receives the record in question. (i) Subsections (b) and (h) do not apply to a filing office described in Section 9-501(a)(1). Section 9-520. (a) A filing office shall refuse to accept a record for filing for a reason set forth in Section 9-516(b) and may refuse to accept a record for filing only for a reason set forth in Section 9-516(b). (b) If a filing office refuses to accept a record for filing, it shall communicate to the person that presented the record the fact of and reason for the refusal and the date and time the record would have been filed had the filing office accepted it. The communication must be made at the time and in the manner prescribed by filing-office rule but, in the case of a filing office described in Section 9-501(a)(2), in no event more than two business days after the filing office receives the record. (c) A filed financing statement satisfying Section 9-502(a) and (b) is effective, even if the filing office is required to refuse to accept it for filing under subsection (a). However, Section 9-338 applies to a filed financing statement providing information described in Section 9- 516(b)(5) which is incorrect at the time the financing statement is filed. (d) If a record communicated to a filing office provides information that relates to more than one debtor, this part applies as to each debtor separately. Section 9-521. (a) A filing office that accepts written records may not refuse to accept a written initial financing statement in the following form and format except for a reason set forth in Section 9-516(b): _____________________________________________________________________________ (b) A filing office that accepts written records may not refuse to accept a written record in the following form and format except for a reason set forth in Section 9-516(b): _____________________________________________________________________________ Section 9-522. (a) The filing office shall maintain a record of the information provided in a filed financing statement for at least one year after the effectiveness of the financing statement has lapsed under Section 9-515 with respect to all secured parties of record. The record must be retrievable by using the name of the debtor and: (1) if the record was filed or recorded in the filing office described in Section 9-501(a)(1), by using the file number assigned to the initial financing statement to which the record relates and the date and time that the record was filed or recorded; or (2) if the record was filed in the filing office described in Section 9-501(a)(2), by using the file number assigned to the initial financing statement to which the record relates. (b) Except to the extent that a statute governing disposition of public records provides otherwise, the filing office immediately may destroy any written record evidencing a financing statement. However, if the filing office destroys a written record, it shall maintain another record of the financing statement which complies with subsection (a). Section 9-523. (a) If a person that files a written record requests an acknowledgment of the filing, the filing office shall send to the person an image of the record showing the number assigned to the record pursuant to Section 9-519(a)(1) and the date and time of the filing of the record. However, if the person furnishes a copy of the record to the filing office, the filing office may instead: (1) note upon the copy the number assigned to the record pursuant to Section 9-519(a)(1) and the date and time of the filing of the record; and (2) send the copy to the person. (b) If a person files a record other than a written record, the filing office shall communicate to the person an acknowledgment that provides: (1) the information in the record; (2) the number assigned to the record pursuant to Section 9-519(a)(1); and (3) the date and time of the filing of the record. (c) The filing office shall communicate or otherwise make available in a record the following information to any person that requests it: (1) whether there is on file on a date and time specified by the filing office, but not a date earlier than three business days before the filing office receives the request, any financing statement that: (A) designates a particular debtor or, if the request so states, designates a particular debtor at the address specified in the request; (B) has not lapsed under Section 9-515 with respect to all secured parties of record; and (C) if the request so states, has lapsed under Section 9-515 and a record of which is maintained by the filing office under Section 9-522(a); (2) the date and time of filing of each financing statement; and (3) the information provided in each financing statement. (d) In complying with its duty under subsection (c), the filing office may communicate information in any medium. However, if requested, the filing office shall communicate information by issuing a record that can be admitted into evidence in the courts of this State without extrinsic evidence of its authenticity. A computer printout from the centralized computer system established by the secretary of state constitutes the certificate of the secretary of state as to whether there is on file, on the date and hour stated thereon, a financing statement covering the following collateral: farm products or accounts, or livestock, or general intangibles arising from or relating to the sale of farm products by a farmer, or crops growing or to be grown, or equipment used in farming operations. The secretary of state shall, upon a telephone request, furnish to any person, company, or corporation, information as to whether a financing statement describing farm collateral has been filed in the office of the secretary of state and, if such financing statement has been filed, the secretary of state shall also furnish the name and business address of the secured creditor. However, the secretary of state need not answer telephone inquiries in writing nor send written confirmation from a telephone request. The secretary of state is not responsible for accuracy and completeness of the information furnished verbally in response to a telephone request. The secretary of state shall provide a toll-free telephone number to provide access for telephone requests. (e) The filing office shall perform the acts required by subsections (a) through (d) at the time and in the manner prescribed by filing-office rule, but not later than two business days after the filing office receives the request. Section 9-524. Delay by the filing office beyond a time limit prescribed by this part is excused if: (1) the delay is caused by interruption of communication or computer facilities, war, emergency conditions, failure of equipment, or other circumstances beyond control of the filing office; and (2) the filing office exercises reasonable diligence under the circumstances. Section 9-525. (a) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (e), the fee for filing and indexing a record under this part, other than an initial financing statement of the kind described in subsection (b), is [the amount specified in subsection (c), if applicable, plus]: (1) $ __[X]______ if the record is communicated in writing and consists of one or two pages; (2) $ __[2X]______ if the record is communicated in writing and consists of more than two pages; and (3) $ __[1/2X]___ if the record is communicated by another medium authorized by filing- office rule. (b) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (e), the fee for filing and indexing an initial financing statement of the following kind is [the amount specified in subsection (c), if applicable, plus]: (1) $ _____ if the financing statement indicates that it is filed in connection with a public- finance transaction; (2) $ _____ if the financing statement indicates that it is filed in connection with a manufactured-home transaction. [Alternative A] (c) The number of names required to be indexed does not affect the amount of the fee in subsections (a) and (b). [Alternative B] (c) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (e), if a record is communicated in writing, the fee for each name more than two required to be indexed is $ _______. (d) The fee for responding to a request for information from the filing office, including for [issuing a certificate showing] [communicating] whether there is on file any financing statement naming a particular debtor, is: (1) $ ____ if the request is communicated in writing; and (2) $ ____ if the request is communicated by another medium authorized by filing-office rule. (e) This section does not require a fee with respect to a record of a mortgage which is effective as a financing statement filed as a fixture filing or as a financing statement covering as- extracted collateral or timber to be cut under Section 9-502(c). However, the recording and satisfaction fees that otherwise would be applicable to the record of the mortgage apply. Section 9-525.1. For the purposes of former \u00a7 57A-9-401, a filing made in the county office of register of deeds prior to July 1, 1986, which has not lapsed prior to July 1, 1986, shall remain effective for the period provided by this title. Any continuation of or amendment to such filing shall be made with the secretary of state. Such central filing shall be accompanied by a certified copy of the original filed financing statement. Section 9-525.2. The secretary of state may promulgate all necessary regulations under the provisions of chapter 1-26 to implement a central filing system for filing financing statements. Section 9-525.3. The secretary of state may adopt rules concerning the operation of the central agricultural security interest computer filing system, prescribing such matters as format for data and the type of information to be recorded from the financing statement. Section 9-525.4. There is hereby created, within the state treasury, the financing statement filing fee fund, which is continuously appropriated, to provide funds for the operation of the uniform commercial code program within the office of the secretary of state. Section 9-525.5. For each effective financing statement filed pursuant to this chapter, three dollars of the fee collected pursuant to Section _____, and the computer search fee assessed pursuant to Section _____, shall be deposited in the financing statement filing fee fund. Section 9-525.6. At the end of each fiscal year, any funds in the financing statement filing fee fund, not otherwise appropriated, in excess of twenty-five thousand dollars, shall revert to the general fund. Section 9-526. (a) The secretary of state shall adopt rules to implement this article. The filing-office rules must be: (1) consistent with this article; and (2) adopted and published in accordance with chapter 1-26. (b) To keep the filing-office rules and practices of the filing office in harmony with the rules and practices of filing offices in other jurisdictions that enact substantially this part, and to keep the technology used by the filing office compatible with the technology used by filing offices in other jurisdictions that enact substantially this part, the secretary of state's office, so far as is consistent with the purposes, policies, and provisions of this article, in adopting, amending, and repealing filing-office rules, shall: (1) consult with filing offices in other jurisdictions that enact substantially this part; and (2) consult the most recent version of the Model Rules promulgated by the International Association of Corporate Administrators or any successor organization; and (3) take into consideration the rules and practices of, and the technology used by, filing offices in other jurisdictions that enact substantially this part. Section 9-601. (a) After default, a secured party has the rights provided in this part and, except as otherwise provided in Section 9-602, those provided by agreement of the parties. A secured party: (1) may reduce a claim to judgment, foreclose, or otherwise enforce the claim, security interest, or agricultural lien by any available judicial procedure; and (2) if the collateral is documents, may proceed either as to the documents or as to the goods they cover. (b) A secured party in possession of collateral or control of collateral under Section 9-104, 9-105, 9-106, or 9-107 has the rights and duties provided in Section 9-207. (c) The rights under subsections (a) and (b) are cumulative and may be exercised simultaneously. (d) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (g) and Section 9-605, after default, a debtor and an obligor have the rights provided in this part and by agreement of the parties. (e) If a secured party has reduced its claim to judgment, the lien of any levy that may be made upon the collateral by virtue of an execution based upon the judgment relates back to the earliest of: (1) the date of perfection of the security interest or agricultural lien in the collateral; (2) the date of filing a financing statement covering the collateral; or (3) any date specified in a statute under which the agricultural lien was created. (f) A sale pursuant to an execution is a foreclosure of the security interest or agricultural lien by judicial procedure within the meaning of this section. A secured party may purchase at the sale and thereafter hold the collateral free of any other requirements of this article.

(2) If requested by a secured party, a holder of a subordinate security interest or other lien shall furnish reasonable proof of the interest or lien within a reasonable time. Unless the holder complies, the secured party need not comply with the holder's demand under paragraph (1)(C).

A secured party that applies or pays over for application noncash proceeds shall do so in a commercially reasonable manner. (4) A secured party shall account to and pay a debtor for any surplus, and the obligor is liable for any deficiency. (b) If the underlying transaction is a sale of accounts, chattel paper, payment intangibles, or promissory notes, the debtor is not entitled to any surplus, and the obligor is not liable for any deficiency.

Section 9-609.1. No cause of action for recovery of security or its value may be commenced by a secured creditor against an innocent third-party purchaser of farm products as defined in subsection (34) of Section 9-102, nor may such a cause of action be commenced against a livestock auction agency, as defined in chapter 40-15 and \u00a7 301 of the Packers and Stockyards Act (7 USC 201), or a public grain warehouse, or a public terminal grain warehouse, or a grain dealer as defined by chapters 49-43, 49-44, and 49-45 respectively, unless such action is commenced within twenty-four months from the date the farm products are sold and unless such action is preceded by the secured creditor offering to file against the debtor, a complaint as defined by \u00a7 23A-2-1. Section 9-609.2. Any person who for himself, or through an agent, sells livestock through a livestock auction agency, as defined in chapter 40-15 and \u00a7 301 of the Packers and Stockyards Act (7 USC 201), or who so sells grain through a public grain warehouse, or through a public terminal grain warehouse, or a grain dealer as defined in chapters 49-43, 49-44, and 49-45 respectively, without notifying the livestock auction agency or the grain warehouse or grain dealer of a security interest in such farm products, and with intent to defraud, is guilty of farm products fraud. The failure of the seller to give written notice of a security interest in the farm products prior to the date of the sale by the livestock auction agency, or the grain warehouse, or grain dealer, is prima facie evidence of intent to defraud. A violation of this section is a Class 1 misdemeanor. Section 9-610.

(d) A contract for sale, lease, license, or other disposition includes the warranties relating to title, possession, quiet enjoyment, and the like which by operation of law accompany a voluntary disposition of property of the kind subject to the contract. (e) A secured party may disclaim or modify warranties under subsection (d): (1) in a manner that would be effective to disclaim or modify the warranties in a voluntary disposition of property of the kind subject to the contract of disposition; or (2) by communicating to the purchaser a record evidencing the contract for disposition and including an express disclaimer or modification of the warranties. (f) A record is sufficient to disclaim warranties under subsection (e) if it indicates \u201cThere is no warranty relating to title, possession, quiet enjoyment, or the like in this disposition\u201d or uses words of similar import. Section 9-611.

(b) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (d), a secured party that disposes of collateral under Section 9-610 shall send to the persons specified in subsection (c) a reasonable authenticated notification of disposition. (c) To comply with subsection (b), the secured party shall send an authenticated notification of disposition to: (1) the debtor; (2) any secondary obligor; and (3) if the collateral is other than consumer goods: (A) any other person from which the secured party has received, before the notification date, an authenticated notification of a claim of an interest in the collateral; (B) any other secured party or lienholder that, 10 days before the notification date, held a security interest in or other lien on the collateral perfected by the filing of a financing statement that: (i) identified the collateral; (ii) was indexed under the debtor's name as of that date; and (iii) was filed in the office in which to file a financing statement against the debtor covering the collateral as of that date; and (C) any other secured party that, 10 days before the notification date, held a security interest in the collateral perfected by compliance with a statute, regulation, or treaty described in Section 9-311(a).

Section 9-612. (a) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b), whether a notification is sent within a reasonable time is a question of fact. (b) In a transaction other than a consumer transaction, a notification of disposition sent after default and 10 days or more before the earliest time of disposition set forth in the notification is sent within a reasonable time before the disposition. Section 9-613.

Unless the holder does so, the secured party need not comply with the holder's demand under subsection (a)(3).

(a) In this section, \"transfer statement\" means a record authenticated by a secured party stating: (1) that the debtor has defaulted in connection with an obligation secured by specified collateral; (2) that the secured party has exercised its post-default remedies with respect to the collateral; (3) that, by reason of the exercise, a transferee has acquired the rights of the debtor in the collateral; and (4) the name and mailing address of the secured party, debtor, and transferee. (b) A transfer statement entitles the transferee to the transfer of record of all rights of the debtor in the collateral specified in the statement in any official filing, recording, registration, or certificate-of-title system covering the collateral. If a transfer statement is presented with the applicable fee and request form to the official or office responsible for maintaining the system, the official or office shall: (1) accept the transfer statement; (2) promptly amend its records to reflect the transfer; and (3) if applicable, issue a new appropriate certificate of title in the name of the transferee. (c) A transfer of the record or legal title to collateral to a secured party under subsection (b) or otherwise is not of itself a disposition of collateral under this article and does not of itself relieve the secured party of its duties under this article. Section 9-620. (a) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (g), a secured party may accept collateral in full or partial satisfaction of the obligation it secures only if: (1) the debtor consents to the acceptance under subsection (c); (2) the secured party does not receive, within the time set forth in subsection (d), a notification of objection to the proposal authenticated by: (A) a person to which the secured party was required to send a proposal under Section 9-621; or (B) any other person, other than the debtor, holding an interest in the collateral subordinate to the security interest that is the subject of the proposal; (3) if the collateral is consumer goods, the collateral is not in the possession of the debtor when the debtor consents to the acceptance; and (4) subsection (e) does not require the secured party to dispose of the collateral or the debtor waives the requirement pursuant to Section 9-624.

(c) For purposes of this section: (1) a debtor consents to an acceptance of collateral in partial satisfaction of the obligation it secures only if the debtor agrees to the terms of the acceptance in a record authenticated after default; and (2) a debtor consents to an acceptance of collateral in full satisfaction of the obligation it secures only if the debtor agrees to the terms of the acceptance in a record authenticated after default or the secured party: (A) sends to the debtor after default a proposal that is unconditional or subject only to a condition that collateral not in the possession of the secured party be preserved or maintained; (B) in the proposal, proposes to accept collateral in full satisfaction of the obligation it secures; and (C) does not receive a notification of objection authenticated by the debtor within 20 days after the proposal is sent.

(b) To redeem collateral, a person shall tender: (1) fulfillment of all obligations secured by the collateral; and (2) the reasonable expenses and attorney's fees described in Section 9-615(a)(1). (c) A redemption may occur at any time before a secured party: (1) has collected collateral under Section 9-607; (2) has disposed of collateral or entered into a contract for its disposition under Section 9-610; or (3) has accepted collateral in full or partial satisfaction of the obligation it secures under Section 9-622.

(b) A debtor may waive the right to require disposition of collateral under Section 9-620(e) only by an agreement to that effect entered into and authenticated after default. (c) Except in a consumer-goods transaction, a debtor or secondary obligor may waive the right to redeem collateral under Section 9-623 only by an agreement to that effect entered into and authenticated after default. Section 9-625. (a) If it is established that a secured party is not proceeding in accordance with this article, a court may order or restrain collection, enforcement, or disposition of collateral on appropriate terms and conditions. (b) Subject to subsections (c) and (d) a person is liable for damages in the amount of any loss caused by a failure to comply with this article. Loss caused by a failure to comply may include loss resulting from the debtor's inability to obtain, or increased costs of, alternative financing. (c) Except as otherwise provided in Section 9-628: (1) a person that, at the time of the failure, was a debtor, was an obligor, or held a security interest in or other lien on the collateral may recover damages under subsection (b) for its loss; and (2) if the collateral is consumer goods, a person that was a debtor or a secondary obligor at the time a secured party failed to comply with this part may recover for that failure in any event an amount not less than the credit service charge plus 10 percent of the principal amount of the obligation or the time-price differential plus 10 percent of the cash price. (d) A debtor whose deficiency is eliminated under Section 9-626 may recover damages for the loss of any surplus.

(e) If a secured party fails to comply with a request regarding a list of collateral or a statement of account under Section 9-210, the secured party may claim a security interest only as shown in the list or statement included in the request as against a person that is reasonably misled by the failure. Section 9-626. (a) In an action arising from a transaction in which the amount of a deficiency or surplus is in issue, the following rules apply: (1) A secured party need not prove compliance with the provisions of this part relating to collection, enforcement, disposition, or acceptance unless the debtor or a secondary obligor places the secured party's compliance in issue. (2) If the secured party's compliance is placed in issue, the secured party has the burden of establishing that the collection, enforcement, disposition, or acceptance was conducted in accordance with this part. (3) Except as otherwise provided in Section 9-628, if a secured party fails to prove that the collection, enforcement, disposition, or acceptance was conducted in accordance with the provisions of this part relating to collection, enforcement, disposition, or acceptance, the liability of a debtor or a secondary obligor for a deficiency is limited to an amount by which the sum of the secured obligation, expenses, and attorney's fees exceeds the greater of: (A) the proceeds of the collection, enforcement, disposition, or acceptance; or (B) the amount of proceeds that would have been realized had the noncomplying secured party proceeded in accordance with the provisions of this part relating to collection, enforcement, disposition, or acceptance. (4) For purposes of paragraph (3)(B), the amount of proceeds that would have been realized is equal to the sum of the secured obligation, expenses, and attorney's fees unless the secured party proves that the amount is less than that sum. (5) If a deficiency or surplus is calculated under Section 9-615(f), the debtor or obligor has the burden of establishing that the amount of proceeds of the disposition is significantly below the range of prices that a complying disposition to a person other than the secured party, a person related to the secured party, or a secondary obligor would have brought. Section 9-627. (a) The fact that a greater amount could have been obtained by a collection, enforcement, disposition, or acceptance at a different time or in a different method from that selected by the secured party is not of itself sufficient to preclude the secured party from establishing that the collection, enforcement, disposition, or acceptance was made in a commercially reasonable manner. (b) A disposition of collateral is made in a commercially reasonable manner if the disposition is made: (1) in the usual manner on any recognized market; (2) at the price current in any recognized market at the time of the disposition; or (3) otherwise in conformity with reasonable commercial practices among dealers in the type of property that was the subject of the disposition. (c) A collection, enforcement, disposition, or acceptance is commercially reasonable if it has been approved: (1) in a judicial proceeding; (2) by a bona fide creditors' committee; (3) by a representative of creditors; or (4) by an assignee for the benefit of creditors. (d) Approval under subsection (c) need not be obtained, and lack of approval does not mean that the collection, enforcement, disposition, or acceptance is not commercially reasonable. Section 9-628. (a) Unless a secured party knows that a person is a debtor or obligor, knows the identity of the person, and knows how to communicate with the person: (1) the secured party is not liable to the person, or to a secured party or lienholder that has filed a financing statement against the person, for failure to comply with this article; and (2) the secured party's failure to comply with this article does not affect the liability of the person for a deficiency. (b) A secured party is not liable because of its status as secured party: (1) to a person that is a debtor or obligor, unless the secured party knows: (A) that the person is a debtor or obligor; (B) the identity of the person; and (C) how to communicate with the person; or (2) to a secured party or lienholder that has filed a financing statement against a person, unless the secured party knows: (A) that the person is a debtor; and (B) the identity of the person. (c) A secured party is not liable to any person, and a person's liability for a deficiency is not affected, because of any act or omission arising out of the secured party's reasonable belief that a transaction is not a consumer-goods transaction or a consumer transaction or that goods are not consumer goods, if the secured party's belief is based on its reasonable reliance on: (1) a debtor's representation concerning the purpose for which collateral was to be used, acquired, or held; or (2) an obligor's representation concerning the purpose for which a secured obligation was incurred. (d) A secured party is not liable to any person under Section 9-625(c)(2) for its failure to comply with Section 9-616. (e) A secured party is not liable under Section 9-625(c)(2) more than once with respect to any one secured obligation. Section 9-701. This Act is effective on July 1, 2001. Section 9-702. (a) Except as otherwise provided in this part, this Act applies to a transaction or lien within its scope, even if the transaction or lien was entered into or created before this Act takes effect. (b) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c) and Sections 9-703 through 9-709: (1) transactions and liens that were not governed by former Article 9, were validly entered into or created before this Act takes effect, and would be subject to this Act if they had been entered into or created after this Act takes effect, and the rights, duties, and interests flowing from those transactions and liens remain valid after this Act takes effect; and (2) the transactions and liens may be terminated, completed, consummated, and enforced as required or permitted by this Act or by the law that otherwise would apply if this Act had not taken effect. (c) This Act does not affect an action, case, or proceeding commenced before this Act takes effect. Section 9-703. (a) A security interest that is enforceable immediately before this Act takes effect and would have priority over the rights of a person that becomes a lien creditor at that time is a perfected security interest under this Act if, when this Act takes effect, the applicable requirements for enforceability and perfection under this Act are satisfied without further action. (b) Except as otherwise provided in Section 9-705, if, immediately before this Act takes effect, a security interest is enforceable and would have priority over the rights of a person that becomes a lien creditor at that time, but the applicable requirements for enforceability or perfection under this Act are not satisfied when this Act takes effect, the security interest: (1) is a perfected security interest for one year after this Act takes effect; (2) remains enforceable thereafter only if the security interest becomes enforceable under Section 9-203 before the year expires; and (3) remains perfected thereafter only if the applicable requirements for perfection under this Act are satisfied before the year expires. Section 9-704. A security interest that is enforceable immediately before this Act takes effect but which would be subordinate to the rights of a person that becomes a lien creditor at that time: (1) remains an enforceable security interest for one year after this Act takes effect; (2) remains enforceable thereafter if the security interest becomes enforceable under Section 9-203 when this Act takes effect or within one year thereafter; and (3) becomes perfected: (A) without further action, when this Act takes effect if the applicable requirements for perfection under this Act are satisfied before or at that time; or (B) when the applicable requirements for perfection are satisfied if the requirements are satisfied after that time. Section 9-705. (a) If action, other than the filing of a financing statement, is taken before this Act takes effect and the action would have resulted in priority of a security interest over the rights of a person that becomes a lien creditor had the security interest become enforceable before this Act takes effect, the action is effective to perfect a security interest that attaches under this Act within one year after this Act takes effect. An attached security interest becomes unperfected one year after this Act takes effect unless the security interest becomes a perfected security interest under this Act before the expiration of that period. (b) The filing of a financing statement before this Act takes effect is effective to perfect a security interest to the extent the filing would satisfy the applicable requirements for perfection under this Act. (c) This Act does not render ineffective an effective financing statement that, before this Act takes effect, is filed and satisfies the applicable requirements for perfection under the law of the jurisdiction governing perfection as provided in former Section 9-103. However, except as otherwise provided in subsections (d) and (e) and Section 9-706, the financing statement ceases to be effective at the earlier of: (1) the time the financing statement would have ceased to be effective under the law of the jurisdiction in which it is filed; or (2) June 30, 2006. (d) The filing of a continuation statement after this Act takes effect does not continue the effectiveness of the financing statement filed before this Act takes effect. However, upon the timely filing of a continuation statement after this Act takes effect and in accordance with the law of the jurisdiction governing perfection as provided in Part 3, the effectiveness of a financing statement filed in the same office in that jurisdiction before this Act takes effect continues for the period provided by the law of that jurisdiction. (e) Subsection (c)(2) applies to a financing statement that, before this Act takes effect, is filed against a transmitting utility and satisfies the applicable requirements for perfection under the law of the jurisdiction governing perfection as provided in former Section 9-103 only to the extent that Part 3 provides that the law of a jurisdiction other than the jurisdiction in which the financing statement is filed governs perfection of a security interest in collateral covered by the financing statement. (f) A financing statement that includes a financing statement filed before this Act takes effect and a continuation statement filed after this Act takes effect is effective only to the extent that it satisfies the requirements of Part 5 for an initial financing statement. Section 9-706. (a) The filing of an initial financing statement in the office specified in Section 9-501 continues the effectiveness of a financing statement filed before this Act takes effect if: (1) the filing of an initial financing statement in that office would be effective to perfect a security interest under this Act; (2) the pre-effective-date financing statement was filed in an office in another State or another office in this State; and (3) the initial financing statement satisfies subsection (c). (b) The filing of an initial financing statement under subsection (a) continues the effectiveness of the pre-effective-date financing statement: (1) if the initial financing statement is filed before this Act takes effect, for the period provided in \u00a7 57A-9-403 with respect to a financing statement; and (2) if the initial financing statement is filed after this Act takes effect, for the period provided in Section 9-515 with respect to an initial financing statement. (c) To be effective for purposes of subsection (a), an initial financing statement must: (1) satisfy the requirements of Part 5 for an initial financing statement; (2) identify the pre-effective-date financing statement by indicating the office in which the financing statement was filed and providing the dates of filing and file numbers, if any, of the financing statement and of the most recent continuation statement filed with respect to the financing statement; and (3) indicate that the pre-effective-date financing statement remains effective. Section 9-707. (a) In this section, \"pre-effective-date financing statement\" means a financing statement filed before this Act takes effect. (b) After this Act takes effect, a person may add or delete collateral covered by, continue or terminate the effectiveness of, or otherwise amend the information provided in, a pre-effective- date financing statement only in accordance with the law of the jurisdiction governing perfection as provided in Part 3. However, the effectiveness of a pre-effective-date financing statement also may be terminated in accordance with the law of the jurisdiction in which the financing statement is filed. (c) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (d), if the law of this State governs perfection of a security interest, the information in a pre-effective-date financing statement may be amended after this Act takes effect only if: (1) the pre-effective-date financing statement and an amendment are filed in the office specified in Section 9-501; (2) an amendment is filed in the office specified in Section 9-501 concurrently with, or after the filing in that office of, an initial financing statement that satisfies Section 9- 706(c); or (3) an initial financing statement that provides the information as amended and satisfies Section 9-706(c) is filed in the office specified in Section 9-501. (d) If the law of this State governs perfection of a security interest, the effectiveness of a pre- effective-date financing statement may be continued only under Section 9-705(d) and (f) or 9- 706. (e) Whether or not the law of this State governs perfection of a security interest, the effectiveness of a pre-effective-date financing statement filed in this State may be terminated after this Act takes effect by filing a termination statement in the office in which the pre-effective-date financing statement is filed, unless an initial financing statement that satisfies Section 9-706(c) has been filed in the office specified by the law of the jurisdiction governing perfection as provided in Part 3 as the office in which to file a financing statement. Section 9-708. A person may file an initial financing statement or a continuation statement under this part if: (1) the secured party of record authorizes the filing; and (2) the filing is necessary under this part: (A) to continue the effectiveness of a financing statement filed before this Act takes effect; or (B) to perfect or continue the perfection of a security interest. Section 9-709. (a) This Act determines the priority of conflicting claims to collateral. However, if the relative priorities of the claims were established before this Act takes effect, former chapter 57A-9 determines priority. (b) For purposes of Section 9-322(a), the priority of a security interest that becomes enforceable under Section 9-203 of this Act dates from the time this Act takes effect if the security interest is perfected under this Act by the filing of a financing statement before this Act takes effect which would not have been effective to perfect the security interest under former chapter 57A-9. This subsection does not apply to conflicting security interests each of which is perfected by the filing of such a financing statement. Section 1. That chapter 57A-9 be repealed. Section 2. That \u00a7 57A-1-105 be amended to read as follows: 57A-1-105.

Failing such agreement this title applies to transactions bearing an appropriate relation to this state.

Unless a consignment is intended as security, reservation of title thereunder is not a \"security interest\" but a consignment in any event is subject to the provisions on consignment sales ( \u00a7 57A-2-326). Except as otherwise provided in Section 2-505, the right of a seller or lessor of goods under Article 2 or 2A to retain or acquire possession of the goods is not a \"security interest,\" but a seller or lessor may also acquire a \"security interest\" by complying with Article 9. The retention or reservation of title by a seller of goods notwithstanding shipment or delivery to the buyer (Section 2-401) is limited in effect to a reservation of a \"security interest.\" Whether a transaction creates a lease or security interest is determined by the facts of each case; however, a transaction creates a security interest if the consideration the lessee is to pay the lessor for the right to possession and use of the goods is an obligation for the term of the lease not subject to termination by the lessee, and (a) the original term of the lease is equal to or greater than the remaining economic life of the goods, (b) the lessee is bound to renew the lease for the remaining economic life of the goods or is bound to become the owner of the goods, (c) the lessee has an option to renew the lease for the remaining economic life of the goods for no additional consideration or nominal additional consideration upon compliance with the lease agreement, or (d) the lessee has an option to become the owner of the goods for no additional consideration or nominal additional consideration upon compliance with the lease agreement. A transaction does not create a security interest merely because it provides that: (a) the present value of the consideration the lessee is obligated to pay the lessor for the right to possession and use of the goods is substantially equal to or is greater than the fair market value of the goods at the time the lease is entered into, (b) the lessee assumes risk of loss of the goods, or agrees to pay taxes, insurance, filing, recording, or registration fees, or service or maintenance costs with respect to the goods, (c) the lessee has an option to renew the lease or to become the owner of the goods, (d) the lessee has an option to renew the lease for a fixed rent that is equal to or greater than the reasonably predictable fair market rent for the use of the goods for the term of the renewal at the time the option is to be performed, or (e) the lessee has an option to become the owner of the goods for a fixed price that is equal to or greater than the reasonably predictable fair market value of the goods at the time the option is to be performed. For purposes of this subsection (37): (a) Additional consideration is not nominal if (i) when the option to renew the lease is granted to the lessee the rent is stated to be the fair market rent for the use of the goods for the term of the renewal determined at the time the option is to be performed, or (ii) when the option to become the owner of the goods is granted to the lessee the price is stated to be the fair market value of the goods determined at the time the option is to be performed. Additional consideration is nominal if it is less than the lessee's reasonably predictable cost of performing under the lease agreement if the option is not exercised; (b) \"Reasonably predictable\" and \"remaining economic life of the goods\" are to be determined with reference to the facts and circumstances at the time the transaction is entered into; and (c) \"Present value\" means the amount as of a date certain of one or more sums payable in the future, discounted to the date certain. The discount is determined by the interest rate specified by the parties if the rate is not manifestly unreasonable at the time the transaction is entered into; otherwise, the discount is determined by a commercially reasonable rate that takes into account the facts and circumstances of each case at the time the transaction was entered into. (38) \"Send\" in connection with any writing or notice means to deposit in the mail or deliver for transmission by any other usual means of communication with postage or cost of transmission provided for and properly addressed and in the case of an instrument to an address specified thereon or otherwise agreed, or if there be none to any address reasonable under the circumstances. The receipt of any writing or notice within the time at which it would have arrived if properly sent has the effect of a proper sending. (39) \"Signed\" includes any symbol executed or adopted by a party with present intention to authenticate a writing. (40) \"Surety\" includes guarantor. (41) \"Telegram\" includes a message transmitted by radio, teletype, cable, any mechanical method of transmission, or the like. (42) \"Term\" means that portion of an agreement which relates to a particular matter. (43) \"Unauthorized\" signature means one made without actual, implied, or apparent authority and includes a forgery.

(4) In addition chapter 57A-1 contains general definitions and principles of construction and interpretation applicable throughout this chapter. Section 5. That \u00a7 57A-2-210 be amended to read as follows: 57A-2-210. (1) A party may perform his duty through a delegate unless otherwise agreed or unless the other party has a substantial interest in having his original promisor perform or control the acts required by the contract. No delegation of performance relieves the party delegating of any duty to perform or any liability for breach. (2) Unless Except as otherwise provided in Section 9-406, unless otherwise agreed , all rights of either seller or buyer can be assigned except where the assignment would materially change the duty of the other party, or increase materially the burden or risk imposed on him by his contract, or impair materially his chance of obtaining return performance. A right to damages for breach of the whole contract or a right arising out of the assignor's due performance of his entire obligation can be assigned despite agreement otherwise. (3) Unless the circumstances indicate the contrary a prohibition of assignment of \"the contract\" is to be construed as barring only the delegation to the assignee of the assignor's performance. The creation, attachment, perfection, or enforcement of a security interest in the seller's interest under a contract is not a transfer that materially changes the duty of or increases materially the burden or risk imposed on the buyer or impairs materially the buyer's chance of obtaining return performance within the purview of subsection (2) unless, and then only to the extent that, enforcement actually results in a delegation of material performance of the seller. Even in that event, the creation, attachment, perfection, and enforcement of the security interest remain effective, but (i) the seller is liable to the buyer for damages caused by the delegation to the extent that the damages could not reasonably be prevented by the buyer, and (ii) a court having jurisdiction may grant other appropriate relief, including cancellation of the contract for sale or an injunction against enforcement of the security interest or consummation of the enforcement. (4) An assignment of \"the contract\" or of \"all my rights under the contract\" or an assignment in similar general terms is an assignment of rights and unless the language or the circumstances (as in an assignment for security) indicate the contrary, it is a delegation of performance of the duties of the assignor and its acceptance by the assignee constitutes a promise by him to perform those duties. This promise is enforceable by either the assignor or the other party to the original contract. (5) The other party may treat any assignment which delegates performance as creating reasonable grounds for insecurity and may without prejudice to his rights against the assignor demand assurances from the assignee ( \u00a7 57A-2-609). Section 6. That \u00a7 57A-2-326 be amended to read as follows: 57A-2-326. (1) Unless otherwise agreed, if delivered goods may be returned by the buyer even though they conform to the contract, the transaction is (a) A \"sale on approval\" if the goods are delivered primarily for use; and (b) A \"sale or return\" if the goods are delivered primarily for resale. (2) Except as provided in subsection (3), goods Goods held on approval are not subject to the claims of the buyer's creditors until acceptance; goods held on sale or return are subject to such claims while in the buyer's possession. (3) Where goods are delivered to a person for sale and such person maintains a place of business at which he deals in goods of the kind involved, under a name other than the name of the person making delivery, then with respect to claims of creditors of the person conducting the business the goods are deemed to be on sale or return. The provisions of this section are applicable even though an agreement purports to reserve title to the person making delivery until payment or resale or uses such words as \"on consignment\" or \"on memorandum.\" However, this section is not applicable if the person making delivery: (a) Complies with an applicable law providing for a consignor's interest or the like to be evidenced by a sign; or (b) Establishes that the person conducting the business is generally known by his creditors to be substantially engaged in selling the goods of others; or (c) Complies with the filing provisions of the chapter on secured transactions (chapter 57A-9). (4) Any \"or return\" term of a contract for sale is to be treated as a separate contract for sale within the statute of frauds section of this chapter ( \u00a7 57A-2-201) and as contradicting the sale aspect of the contract within the provisions of this chapter on parol or extrinsic evidence ( \u00a7 57A-2-202). Section 7. That \u00a7 57A-2-502 be amended to read as follows: 57A-2-502. (1) Subject to subsection subsections (2) and (3) and even though the goods have not been shipped a buyer who has paid a part or all of the price of goods in which he has a special property under the provisions of \u00a7 57A-2-501 may on making and keeping good a tender of any unpaid portion of their price recover them from the seller if : (a) in the case of goods bought for personal, family, or household purposes, the seller repudiates or fails to deliver as required by the contract; or (b) in all cases, the seller becomes insolvent within ten days after receipt of the first installment on their price. (2) The buyer's right to recover the goods under subsection (1)(a) vests upon acquisition of a special property, even if the seller had not then repudiated or failed to deliver. (3) If the identification creating his special property has been made by the buyer he acquires the right to recover the goods only if they conform to the contract for sale. Section 8. That \u00a7 57A-2-716 be amended to read as follows: 57A-2-716. (1) Specific performance may be decreed where the goods are unique or in other proper circumstances. (2) The decree for specific performance may include such terms and conditions as to payment of the price, damages, or other relief as the court may deem just. (3) The buyer has a right of replevin for goods identified to the contract if after reasonable effort he is unable to effect cover for such goods or the circumstances reasonably indicate that such effort will be unavailing or if the goods have been shipped under reservation and satisfaction of the security interest in them has been made or tendered. In the case of goods bought for personal, family, or household purposes, the buyer's right of replevin vests upon acquisition of a special property, even if the seller had not then repudiated or failed to deliver. Section 9. That \u00a7 57A-2A-103 be amended to read as follows: 57A-2A-103. (1) In this chapter unless the context otherwise requires: (a) \"Buyer in ordinary course of business\" means a person who in good faith and without knowledge that the sale to him is in violation of the ownership rights or security interest or leasehold interest of a third party in the goods buys in ordinary course from a person in the business of selling goods of that kind but does not include a pawnbroker. \"Buying\" may be for cash or by exchange of other property or on secured or unsecured credit and includes receiving goods or documents of title under a preexisting contract for sale but does not include a transfer in bulk or as security for or in total or partial satisfaction of a money debt.

(h) \"Goods\" means all things that are movable at the time of identification to the lease contract, or are fixtures ( \u00a7 57A-2A-309), but the term does not include money, documents, instruments, accounts, chattel paper, general intangibles, or minerals or the like, including oil and gas, before extraction. The term also includes the unborn young of animals. (i) \"Installment lease contract\" means a lease contract that authorizes or requires the delivery of goods in separate lots to be separately accepted, even though the lease contract contains a clause \"each delivery is a separate lease\" or its equivalent. (j) \"Lease\" means a transfer of the right to possession and use of goods for a term in return for consideration, but a sale, including a sale on approval or a sale or return, or retention or creation of a security interest is not a lease. Unless the context clearly indicates otherwise, the term includes a sublease. (k) \"Lease agreement\" means the bargain, with respect to the lease, of the lessor and the lessee in fact as found in their language or by implication from other circumstances including course of dealing or usage of trade or course of performance as provided in this chapter. Unless the context clearly indicates otherwise, the term includes a sublease agreement.

(4) In addition, chapter 57A-1 (commencing with \u00a7 57A-1-101) contains general definitions and principles of construction and interpretation applicable throughout this chapter. Section 10. That \u00a7 57A-2A-307 be amended to read as follows: 57A-2A-307. (1) Except as otherwise provided in \u00a7 57A-2A-306, a creditor of a lessee takes subject to the lease contract. (2) Except as otherwise provided in subsections subsection (3) and (4) of this section and in \u00a7 \u00a7 57A-2A-306 and 57A-2A-308, a creditor of a lessor takes subject to the lease contract ; (a) Unless unless the creditor holds a lien that attached to the goods before the lease contract became enforceable ; (b) Unless the creditor holds a security interest in the goods and the lessee did not give value and receive delivery of the goods without knowledge of the security interest; or (c) Unless the creditor holds a security interest in the goods that attached and was perfected before (i) the lease contract became enforceable, (ii) the lessee gave value and received delivery of the goods, or (iii) in the case of a purchase money security interest, the date that is twenty days after the date that the lessor received possession of the goods or the date that the lessee received possession of the goods, whichever is earlier. (3) A lessee in the ordinary course of business takes the leasehold interest free of a security interest in the goods created by the lessor even though the security interest is perfected and the lessee knows of its existence. (4) A lessee other than a lessee in the ordinary course of business takes the leasehold interest free of a security interest to the extent that it secures future advances made after the secured party acquires knowledge of the lease or more than forty-five days after the lease contract becomes enforceable, whichever first occurs, unless the future advances are made pursuant to a commitment entered into without knowledge of the lease and before the expiration of the forty-five-day period . (3) Except as otherwise provided in Sections 9-317, 9-321, and 9-323, a lessee takes a leasehold interest subject to a security interest held by a creditor of the lessor. Section 11. That \u00a7 57A-2A-309 be amended to read as follows: 57A-2A-309. (1) In this section: (a) Goods are \"fixtures\" when they become so related to particular real estate that an interest in them arises under real estate law; (b) A \"fixture filing\" is the filing, in the office where a mortgage on the real estate would be recorded, of a financing statement concerning goods that are or are to become fixtures and conforming to the requirements of \u00a7 57A-9-402(5) Section 9-502(a) and (b) ; (c) A lease is a \"purchase money lease\" unless the lessee has possession or use of the goods or the right to possession or use of the goods before the lease agreement is enforceable; (d) A mortgage is a \"construction mortgage\" to the extent it secures an obligation incurred for the construction of an improvement on land including the acquisition cost of the land, if the recorded writing so indicates; and (e) \"Encumbrance\" includes real estate mortgages and other liens on real estate and all other rights in real estate that are not ownership interests. (2) Under this chapter a lease may be of goods that are fixtures or may continue in goods that become fixtures, but no lease exists under this chapter of ordinary building materials incorporated into an improvement on land. (3) This chapter does not prevent creation of a lease of fixtures pursuant to real estate law. (4) The perfected interest of a lessor of fixtures has priority over a conflicting interest of an encumbrancer or owner of the real estate if: (a) The lease is a purchase money lease, the conflicting interest of the encumbrancer or owner arises before the goods become fixtures, a fixture filing covering the fixtures is filed before the goods become fixtures or within twenty days thereafter, and the lessee has an interest of record in the real estate or is in possession of the real estate; (b) A fixture filing covering the fixtures is filed before the interest of the encumbrancer or owner is of record, the lessor's interest has priority over any conflicting interest of a predecessor in title of the encumbrancer or owner, and the lessee has an interest of record in the real estate or is in possession of the real estate; (c) The fixtures are readily removable factory or office machines, readily removable equipment that is not primarily used or leased for use in the operation of the real estate, or readily removable replacements of domestic appliances that are goods subject to a consumer lease; (d) The conflicting interest is a lien on the real estate obtained by legal or equitable proceedings after the lease contract is enforceable; (e) The encumbrancer or owner has consented in writing to the lease or has disclaimed an interest in the goods as fixtures; or (f) The lessee has a right to remove the goods as against the encumbrancer or owner. If the lessee's right to remove terminates, the priority of the interest of the lessor continues for a reasonable time. (5) Notwithstanding subsection (a) of subsection (4) of this section but otherwise subject to subsection (4), the interest of a lessor of fixtures is subordinate to the conflicting interest of an encumbrancer of the real estate under a construction mortgage recorded before the goods become fixtures if the goods become fixtures before the completion of the construction. To the extent given to refinance a construction mortgage, the conflicting interest of an encumbrancer of the real estate under a mortgage has this priority to the same extent as the encumbrancer of the real estate under the construction mortgage. (6) In cases not within the preceding subsections, priority between the interest of a lessor of fixtures and the conflicting interest of an encumbrancer or owner of the real estate who is not the lessee is determined by the priority rules governing conflicting interests in real estate. (7) If the interest of a lessor has priority over all conflicting interests of all owners and encumbrancers of the real estate, the lessor or the lessee may (a) on default, expiration, termination, or cancellation of the lease agreement by the other party but subject to the provisions of the lease agreement and this chapter, or (b) if necessary to enforce his other rights and remedies under this chapter, remove the goods from the real estate, free and clear of all conflicting interests of all owners and encumbrancers of the real estate, but he must reimburse any encumbrancer or owner of the real estate who is not the lessee and who has not otherwise agreed for the cost of repair of any physical injury, but not for any diminution in value of the real estate caused by the absence of the goods removed or by any necessity of replacing them. A person entitled to reimbursement may refuse permission to remove until the party seeking removal gives adequate security for the performance of this obligation. Section 12. That \u00a7 57A-4-210 be amended to read as follows: 57A-4-210. (a) A collecting bank has a security interest in an item and any accompanying documents or the proceeds of either: (1) In case of an item deposited in an account, to the extent to which credit given for the item has been withdrawn or applied; (2) In case of an item for which it has given credit available for withdrawal as of right, to the extent of the credit given, whether or not the credit is drawn upon or there is a right of charge-back; or (3) If it makes an advance on or against the item. (b) If credit given for several items received at one time or pursuant to a single agreement is withdrawn or applied in part, the security interest remains upon all the items, any accompanying documents or the proceeds of either. For the purpose of this section, credits first given are first withdrawn. (c) Receipt by a collecting bank of a final settlement for an item is a realization on its security interest in the item, accompanying documents, and proceeds. So long as the bank does not receive final settlement for the item or give up possession of the item or accompanying documents for purposes other than collection, the security interest continues to that extent and is subject to chapter 57A-9, but: (1) No security agreement is necessary to make the security interest enforceable ( \u00a7 57A-9-203(1)(a)) (Section 9-203(b)(3)(A)) ; (2) No filing is required to perfect the security interest; and (3) The security interest has priority over conflicting perfected security interests in the item, accompanying documents, or proceeds. Section 13. That chapter 57A-5 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Section 5-118. (a) An issuer or nominated person has a security interest in a document presented under a letter of credit to the extent that the issuer or nominated person honors or gives value for the presentation. (b) So long as and to the extent that an issuer or nominated person has not been reimbursed or has not otherwise recovered the value given with respect to a security interest in a document under subsection (a), the security interest continues and is subject to Article 9, but: (1) a security agreement is not necessary to make the security interest enforceable under Section 9-203(b)(3); (2) if the document is presented in a medium other than a written or other tangible medium, the security interest is perfected; and (3) if the document is presented in a written or other tangible medium and is not a certificated security, chattel paper, a document of title, an instrument, or a letter of credit, the security interest is perfected and has priority over a conflicting security interest in the document so long as the debtor does not have possession of the document. Section 14. That \u00a7 57A-7-503 be amended to read as follows: 57A-7-503. (1) A document of title confers no right in goods against a person who before issuance of the document had a legal interest or a perfected security interest in them and who neither: (a) Delivered or entrusted them or any document of title covering them to the bailor or his nominee with actual or apparent authority to ship, store or sell or with power to obtain delivery under this chapter ( \u00a7 57A-7-403) or with power of disposition under this title ( \u00a7 57A-2-403 and 57A-9-307 Section 9-320 ) or other statute or rule of law; nor (b) Acquiesced in the procurement by the bailor or his nominee of any document of title. (2) Title to goods based upon an unaccepted delivery order is subject to the rights of anyone to whom a negotiable warehouse receipt or bill of lading covering the goods has been duly negotiated. Such a title may be defeated under \u00a7 57A-7-504 to the same extent as the rights of the issuer or a transferee from the issuer. (3) Title to goods based upon a bill of lading issued to a freight forwarder is subject to the rights of anyone to whom a bill issued by the freight forwarder is duly negotiated; but delivery by the carrier in accordance with part 4 of this chapter pursuant to its own bill of lading discharges the carrier's obligation to deliver. Section 15. That \u00a7 57A-8-103 be amended to read as follows: 57A-8-103. In this chapter: (a) A share or similar equity interest issued by a corporation, business trust, joint stock company, or similar entity is a security. (b) An \"investment company security\" is a security. \"Investment company security\" means a share or similar equity interest issued by an entity that is registered as an investment company under the federal investment company laws, an interest in a unit investment trust that is so registered, or a face-amount certificate issued by a face-amount certificate company that is so registered. Investment company security does not include an insurance policy or endowment policy or annuity contract issued by an insurance company. (c) An interest in a partnership or limited liability company is not a security unless it is dealt in or traded on securities exchanges or in securities markets, its terms expressly provide that it is a security governed by this chapter, or it is an investment company security. However, an interest in a partnership or limited liability company is a financial asset if it is held in a securities account. (d) A writing that is a security certificate is governed by this chapter and not by chapter 57A-3, even though it also meets the requirements of that chapter. However, a negotiable instrument governed by chapter 57A-3 is a financial asset if it is held in a securities account. (e) An option or similar obligation issued by a clearing corporation to its participants is not a security, but is a financial asset. (f) A commodity contract, as defined in \u00a7 57A-9-115 Section 9-102(a)(15) , is not a security or a financial asset. Section 16. That \u00a7 57A-8-106 be amended to read as follows: 57A-8-106.

(a) In this section: (1) \"purchase-money collateral\" means goods or software that secures a purchase-money obligation incurred with respect to that collateral; and (2) \"purchase-money obligation\" means an obligation of an obligor incurred as all or part of the price of the collateral or for value given to enable the debtor to acquire rights in or the use of the collateral if the value is in fact so used. (b) A security interest in goods is a purchase-money security interest: (1) to the extent that the goods are purchase-money collateral with respect to that security interest; (2) if the security interest is in inventory that is or was purchase-money collateral, also to the extent that the security interest secures a purchase-money obligation incurred with respect to other inventory in which the secured party holds or held a purchase- money security interest; and (3) also to the extent that the security interest secures a purchase-money obligation incurred with respect to software in which the secured party holds or held a purchase- money security interest. (c) A security interest in software is a purchase-money security interest to the extent that the security interest also secures a purchase-money obligation incurred with respect to goods in which the secured party holds or held a purchase-money security interest if: (1) the debtor acquired its interest in the software in an integrated transaction in which it acquired an interest in the goods; and (2) the debtor acquired its interest in the software for the principal purpose of using the software in the goods. (d) The security interest of a consignor in goods that are the subject of a consignment is a purchase-money security interest in inventory. (e) If the extent to which a security interest is a purchase-money security interest depends on the application of a payment to a particular obligation, the payment must be applied: (1) in accordance with any reasonable method of application to which the parties agree; (2) in the absence of the parties' agreement to a reasonable method, in accordance with any intention of the obligor manifested at or before the time of payment; or (3) in the absence of an agreement to a reasonable method and a timely manifestation of the obligor's intention, in the following order: (A) to obligations that are not secured; and (B) if more than one obligation is secured, to obligations secured by purchase- money security interests in the order in which those obligations were incurred. (f) A purchase-money security interest does not lose its status as such, even if: (1) the purchase-money collateral also secures an obligation that is not a purchase-money obligation; (2) collateral that is not purchase-money collateral also secures the purchase-money obligation; or (3) the purchase-money obligation has been renewed, refinanced, consolidated, or restructured. (g) A secured party claiming a purchase-money security interest has the burden of establishing the extent to which the security interest is a purchase-money security interest. Section 9-104. (a) A secured party has control of a deposit account if: (1) the secured party is the bank with which the deposit account is maintained; (2) the debtor, secured party, and bank have agreed in an authenticated record that the bank will comply with instructions originated by the secured party directing disposition of the funds in the deposit account without further consent by the debtor; or (3) the secured party becomes the bank's customer with respect to the deposit account. (b) A secured party that has satisfied subsection (a) has control, even if the debtor retains the right to direct the disposition of funds from the deposit account. Section 9-105. A secured party has control of electronic chattel paper if the record or records comprising the chattel paper are created, stored, and assigned in such a manner that: (1) a single authoritative copy of the record or records exists which is unique, identifiable and, except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (4), (5), and (6), unalterable; (2) the authoritative copy identifies the secured party as the assignee of the record or records; (3) the authoritative copy is communicated to and maintained by the secured party or its designated custodian; (4) copies or revisions that add or change an identified assignee of the authoritative copy can be made only with the participation of the secured party; (5) each copy of the authoritative copy and any copy of a copy is readily identifiable as a copy that is not the authoritative copy; and (6) any revision of the authoritative copy is readily identifiable as an authorized or unauthorized revision. Section 9-106. (a) A person has control of a certificated security, uncertificated security, or security entitlement as provided in Section 8-106. (b) A secured party has control of a commodity contract if: (1) the secured party is the commodity intermediary with which the commodity contract is carried; or (2) the commodity customer, secured party, and commodity intermediary have agreed that the commodity intermediary will apply any value distributed on account of the commodity contract as directed by the secured party without further consent by the commodity customer. (c) A secured party having control of all security entitlements or commodity contracts carried in a securities account or commodity account has control over the securities account or commodity account. Section 9-107. A secured party has control of a letter-of-credit right to the extent of any right to payment or performance by the issuer or any nominated person if the issuer or nominated person has consented to an assignment of proceeds of the letter of credit under Section 5-114(c) or otherwise applicable law or practice. Section 9-108. (a) Except as otherwise provided in subsections (c), (d), and (e), a description of personal or real property is sufficient, whether or not it is specific, if it reasonably identifies what is described. (b) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (d), a description of collateral reasonably identifies the collateral if it identifies the collateral by: (1) specific listing; (2) category; (3) except as otherwise provided in subsection (e), a type of collateral defined in the Uniform Commercial Code; (4) quantity; (5) computational or allocational formula or procedure; or (6) except as otherwise provided in subsection (c), any other method, if the identity of the collateral is objectively determinable. (c) A description of collateral as \"all the debtor's assets\" or \"all the debtor's personal property\" or using words of similar import does not reasonably identify the collateral. (d) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (e), a description of a security entitlement, securities account, or commodity account is sufficient if it describes: (1) the collateral by those terms or as investment property; or (2) the underlying financial asset or commodity contract. (e) A description only by type of collateral defined in the Uniform Commercial Code is an insufficient description of: (1) a commercial tort claim; or (2) in a consumer transaction, consumer goods, a security entitlement, a securities account, or a commodity account. Section 9-109. (a) Except as otherwise provided in subsections (c) and (d), this article applies to: (1) a transaction, regardless of its form, that creates a security interest in personal property or fixtures by contract; (2) an agricultural lien; (3) a sale of accounts, chattel paper, payment intangibles, or promissory notes; (4) a consignment; (5) a security interest arising under Section 2-401, 2-505, 2-711(3), or 2A-508(5), as provided in Section 9-110; and (6) a security interest arising under Section 4-210 or 5-118.

(c) This article does not apply to the extent that: (1) a statute, regulation, or treaty of the United States preempts this article; (2) another statute of this State expressly governs the creation, perfection, priority, or enforcement of a security interest created by this State or a governmental unit of this State; (3) a statute of another State, a foreign country, or a governmental unit of another State or a foreign country, other than a statute generally applicable to security interests, expressly governs creation, perfection, priority, or enforcement of a security interest created by the State, country, or governmental unit; or (4) the rights of a transferee beneficiary or nominated person under a letter of credit are independent and superior under Section 5-114. (d) This article does not apply to: (1) a landlord's lien, other than an agricultural lien; (2) a lien, other than an agricultural lien, given by statute or other rule of law for services or materials, but Section 9-333 applies with respect to priority of the lien; (3) an assignment of a claim for wages, salary, or other compensation of an employee; (4) a sale of accounts, chattel paper, payment intangibles, or promissory notes as part of a sale of the business out of which they arose; (5) an assignment of accounts, chattel paper, payment intangibles, or promissory notes which is for the purpose of collection only; (6) an assignment of a right to payment under a contract to an assignee that is also obligated to perform under the contract; (7) an assignment of a single account, payment intangible, or promissory note to an assignee in full or partial satisfaction of a preexisting indebtedness; (8) a transfer of an interest in or an assignment of a claim under a policy of insurance, other than an assignment by or to a health-care provider of a health-care-insurance receivable and any subsequent assignment of the right to payment, but Sections 9-315 and 9-322 apply with respect to proceeds and priorities in proceeds; (9) an assignment of a right represented by a judgment, other than a judgment taken on a right to payment that was collateral; (10) a right of recoupment or set-off, but: (A) Section 9-340 applies with respect to the effectiveness of rights of recoupment or set-off against deposit accounts; and (B) Section 9-404 applies with respect to defenses or claims of an account debtor; (11) the creation or transfer of an interest in or lien on real property, including a lease or rents thereunder, except to the extent that provision is made for: (A) liens on real property in Sections 9-203 and 9-308; (B) fixtures in Section 9-334; (C) fixture filings in Sections 9-501, 9-502, 9-512, 9-516, and 9-519; and (D) security agreements covering personal and real property in Section 9-604; (12) an assignment of a claim arising in tort, other than a commercial tort claim, but Sections 9-315 and 9-322 apply with respect to proceeds and priorities in proceeds; (13) an assignment of a deposit account in a consumer transaction, but Sections 9-315 and 9-322 apply with respect to proceeds and priorities in proceeds; or (14) the pledging or segregating of collateral for public deposits as authorized by \u00a7 51-22- 12, chapter 52-5, and chapter 4-6A. Section 9-110. A security interest arising under Section 2-401, 2-505, 2-711(3), or 2A-508(5) is subject to this article.

(b) A transaction subject to this article is subject to any applicable rule of law which establishes a different rule for consumers, any other statute or regulation that regulates the rates, charges, agreements, and practices for loans, credit sales, or other extensions of credit, and any consumer-protection statute or regulation. (c) In case of conflict between this article and a rule of law, statute, or regulation described in subsection (b), the rule of law, statute, or regulation controls.

Section 9-203. (a) A security interest attaches to collateral when it becomes enforceable against the debtor with respect to the collateral, unless an agreement expressly postpones the time of attachment. (b) Except as otherwise provided in subsections (c) through (i), a security interest is enforceable against the debtor and third parties with respect to the collateral only if : (1) value has been given; (2) the debtor has rights in the collateral or the power to transfer rights in the collateral to a secured party; and (3) one of the following conditions is met: (A) the debtor has authenticated a security agreement that provides a description of the collateral and, if the security interest covers timber to be cut, a description of the land concerned; (B) the collateral is not a certificated security and is in the possession of the secured party under Section 9-313 pursuant to the debtor's security agreement; (C) the collateral is a certificated security in registered form and the security certificate has been delivered to the secured party under Section 8-301 pursuant to the debtor's security agreement; or (D) the collateral is deposit accounts, electronic chattel paper, investment property, or letter-of-credit rights, and the secured party has control under Section 9-104, 9-105, 9-106, or 9-107 pursuant to the debtor's security agreement.

(e) If a new debtor becomes bound as debtor by a security agreement entered into by another person: (1) the agreement satisfies subsection (b)(3) with respect to existing or after-acquired property of the new debtor to the extent the property is described in the agreement; and (2) another agreement is not necessary to make a security interest in the property enforceable. (f) The attachment of a security interest in collateral gives the secured party the rights to proceeds provided by Section 9-315 and is also attachment of a security interest in a supporting obligation for the collateral. (g) The attachment of a security interest in a right to payment or performance secured by a security interest or other lien on personal or real property is also attachment of a security interest in the security interest, mortgage, or other lien.

(d) If perfection of a security interest depends upon possession of the collateral by a secured party, perfection occurs no earlier than the time the secured party takes possession and continues only while the secured party retains possession. (e) A security interest in a certificated security in registered form is perfected by delivery when delivery of the certificated security occurs under Section 8-301 and remains perfected by delivery until the debtor obtains possession of the security certificate. (f) A person in possession of collateral is not required to acknowledge that it holds possession for a secured party's benefit. (g) If a person acknowledges that it holds possession for the secured party's benefit: (1) the acknowledgment is effective under subsection (c) or Section 8-301(a), even if the acknowledgment violates the rights of a debtor; and (2) unless the person otherwise agrees or law other than this article otherwise provides, the person does not owe any duty to the secured party and is not required to confirm the acknowledgment to another person. (h) A secured party having possession of collateral does not relinquish possession by delivering the collateral to a person other than the debtor or a lessee of the collateral from the debtor in the ordinary course of the debtor's business if the person was instructed before the delivery or is instructed contemporaneously with the delivery: (1) to hold possession of the collateral for the secured party's benefit; or (2) to redeliver the collateral to the secured party. (i) A secured party does not relinquish possession, even if a delivery under subsection (h) violates the rights of a debtor.

(e) Except as otherwise provided in Sections 9-320 and 9-321, if a person files a financing statement with respect to a purchase-money security interest before or within 20 days after the debtor receives delivery of the collateral, the security interest takes priority over the rights of a buyer, lessee, or lien creditor which arise between the time the security interest attaches and the time of filing. Section 9-318. (a) A debtor that has sold an account, chattel paper, payment intangible, or promissory note does not retain a legal or equitable interest in the collateral sold. (b) For purposes of determining the rights of creditors of, and purchasers for value of an account or chattel paper from, a debtor that has sold an account or chattel paper, while the buyer's security interest is unperfected, the debtor is deemed to have rights and title to the account or chattel paper identical to those the debtor sold.

(a) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b), for purposes of determining the rights of creditors of, and purchasers for value of goods from, a consignee, while the goods are in the possession of the consignee, the consignee is deemed to have rights and title to the goods identical to those the consignor had or had power to transfer. (b) For purposes of determining the rights of a creditor of a consignee, law other than this article determines the rights and title of a consignee while goods are in the consignee's possession if, under this part, a perfected security interest held by the consignor would have priority over the rights of the creditor. Section 9-320.

(a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, priority among conflicting security interests and agricultural liens in the same collateral is determined according to the following rules: (1) Conflicting perfected security interests and agricultural liens rank according to priority in time of filing or perfection. Priority dates from the earlier of the time a filing covering the collateral is first made or the security interest or agricultural lien is first perfected, if there is no period thereafter when there is neither filing nor perfection. (2) A perfected security interest or agricultural lien has priority over a conflicting unperfected security interest or agricultural lien. (3) The first security interest or agricultural lien to attach or become effective has priority if conflicting security interests and agricultural liens are unperfected. (b) For the purposes of subsection (a)(1): (1) the time of filing or perfection as to a security interest in collateral is also the time of filing or perfection as to a security interest in proceeds; and (2) the time of filing or perfection as to a security interest in collateral supported by a supporting obligation is also the time of filing or perfection as to a security interest in the supporting obligation. (c) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (f), a security interest in collateral which qualifies for priority over a conflicting security interest under Section 9-327, 9-328, 9-329, 9-330, or 9-331 also has priority over a conflicting security interest in: (1) any supporting obligation for the collateral; and (2) proceeds of the collateral if: (A) the security interest in proceeds is perfected; (B) the proceeds are cash proceeds or of the same type as the collateral; and (C) in the case of proceeds that are proceeds of proceeds, all intervening proceeds are cash proceeds, proceeds of the same type as the collateral, or an account relating to the collateral.

(g) If more than one security interest qualifies for priority in the same collateral under subsection (a), (b), (d), or (f): (1) a security interest securing an obligation incurred as all or part of the price of the collateral has priority over a security interest securing an obligation incurred for value given to enable the debtor to acquire rights in or the use of collateral; and (2) in all other cases, Section 9-322(a) applies to the qualifying security interests. Section 9-325. (a) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b), a security interest created by a debtor is subordinate to a security interest in the same collateral created by another person if: (1) the debtor acquired the collateral subject to the security interest created by the other person; (2) the security interest created by the other person was perfected when the debtor acquired the collateral; and (3) there is no period thereafter when the security interest is unperfected. (b) Subsection (a) subordinates a security interest only if the security interest: (1) otherwise would have priority solely under Section 9-322(a) or 9-324; or (2) arose solely under Section 2-711(3) or 2A-508(5). Section 9-326. (a) Subject to subsection (b), a security interest created by a new debtor which is perfected by a filed financing statement that is effective solely under Section 9-508 in collateral in which a new debtor has or acquires rights is subordinate to a security interest in the same collateral which is perfected other than by a filed financing statement that is effective solely under Section 9-508. (b) The other provisions of this part determine the priority among conflicting security interests in the same collateral perfected by filed financing statements that are effective solely under Section 9-508. However, if the security agreements to which a new debtor became bound as debtor were not entered into by the same original debtor, the conflicting security interests rank according to priority in time of the new debtor's having become bound. Section 9-327. The following rules govern priority among conflicting security interests in the same deposit account: (1) A security interest held by a secured party having control of the deposit account under Section 9-104 has priority over a conflicting security interest held by a secured party that does not have control. (2) Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (3) and (4), security interests perfected by control under Section 9-314 rank according to priority in time of obtaining control. (3) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (4), a security interest held by the bank with which the deposit account is maintained has priority over a conflicting security interest held by another secured party. (4) A security interest perfected by control under Section 9-104(a)(3) has priority over a security interest held by the bank with which the deposit account is maintained. Section 9-328. The following rules govern priority among conflicting security interests in the same investment property: (1) A security interest held by a secured party having control of investment property under Section 9-106 has priority over a security interest held by a secured party that does not have control of the investment property. (2) Except as otherwise provided in paragraphs (3) and (4), conflicting security interests held by secured parties each of which has control under Section 9-106 rank according to priority in time of: (A) if the collateral is a security, obtaining control; (B) if the collateral is a security entitlement carried in a securities account and: (i) if the secured party obtained control under Section 8-106(d)(1), the secured party's becoming the person for which the securities account is maintained; (ii) if the secured party obtained control under Section 8-106(d)(2), the securities intermediary's agreement to comply with the secured party's entitlement orders with respect to security entitlements carried or to be carried in the securities account; or (iii) if the secured party obtained control through another person under Section 8-106(d)(3), the time on which priority would be based under this paragraph if the other person were the secured party; or (C) if the collateral is a commodity contract carried with a commodity intermediary, the satisfaction of the requirement for control specified in Section 9-106(b)(2) with respect to commodity contracts carried or to be carried with the commodity intermediary. (3) A security interest held by a securities intermediary in a security entitlement or a securities account maintained with the securities intermediary has priority over a conflicting security interest held by another secured party. (4) A security interest held by a commodity intermediary in a commodity contract or a commodity account maintained with the commodity intermediary has priority over a conflicting security interest held by another secured party. (5) A security interest in a certificated security in registered form which is perfected by taking delivery under Section 9-313(a) and not by control under Section 9-314 has priority over a conflicting security interest perfected by a method other than control. (6) Conflicting security interests created by a broker, securities intermediary, or commodity intermediary which are perfected without control under Section 9-106 rank equally. (7) In all other cases, priority among conflicting security interests in investment property is governed by Sections 9-322 and 9-323. Section 9-329. The following rules govern priority among conflicting security interests in the same letter-of-credit right: (1) A security interest held by a secured party having control of the letter-of-credit right under Section 9-107 has priority to the extent of its control over a conflicting security interest held by a secured party that does not have control. (2) Security interests perfected by control under Section 9-314 rank according to priority in time of obtaining control. Section 9-330. (a) A purchaser of chattel paper has priority over a security interest in the chattel paper which is claimed merely as proceeds of inventory subject to a security interest if: (1) in good faith and in the ordinary course of the purchaser's business, the purchaser gives new value and takes possession of the chattel paper or obtains control of the chattel paper under Section 9-105; and (2) the chattel paper does not indicate that it has been assigned to an identified assignee other than the purchaser. (b) A purchaser of chattel paper has priority over a security interest in the chattel paper which is claimed other than merely as proceeds of inventory subject to a security interest if the purchaser gives new value and takes possession of the chattel paper or obtains control of the chattel paper under Section 9-105 in good faith, in the ordinary course of the purchaser's business, and without knowledge that the purchase violates the rights of the secured party. (c) Except as otherwise provided in Section 9-327, a purchaser having priority in chattel paper under subsection (a) or (b) also has priority in proceeds of the chattel paper to the extent that: (1) Section 9-322 provides for priority in the proceeds; or (2) the proceeds consist of the specific goods covered by the chattel paper or cash proceeds of the specific goods, even if the purchaser's security interest in the proceeds is unperfected. (d) Except as otherwise provided in Section 9-331(a), a purchaser of an instrument has priority over a security interest in the instrument perfected by a method other than possession if the purchaser gives value and takes possession of the instrument in good faith and without knowledge that the purchase violates the rights of the secured party. (e) For purposes of subsections (a) and (b), the holder of a purchase-money security interest in inventory gives new value for chattel paper constituting proceeds of the inventory. (f) For purposes of subsections (b) and (d), if chattel paper or an instrument indicates that it has been assigned to an identified secured party other than the purchaser, a purchaser of the chattel paper or instrument has knowledge that the purchase violates the rights of the secured party. Section 9-331. (a) This article does not limit the rights of a holder in due course of a negotiable instrument, a holder to which a negotiable document of title has been duly negotiated, or a protected purchaser of a security. These holders or purchasers take priority over an earlier security interest, even if perfected, to the extent provided in Articles 3, 7, and 8. (b) This article does not limit the rights of or impose liability on a person to the extent that the person is protected against the assertion of a claim under Article 8. (c) Filing under this article does not constitute notice of a claim or defense to the holders, or purchasers, or persons described in subsections (a) and (b). Section 9-332. (a) A transferee of money takes the money free of a security interest unless the transferee acts in collusion with the debtor in violating the rights of the secured party. (b) A transferee of funds from a deposit account takes the funds free of a security interest in the deposit account unless the transferee acts in collusion with the debtor in violating the rights of the secured party. Section 9-333. (a) In this section, \"possessory lien\" means an interest, other than a security interest or an agricultural lien: (1) which secures payment or performance of an obligation for services or materials furnished with respect to goods by a person in the ordinary course of the person's business; (2) which is created by statute or rule of law in favor of the person; and (3) whose effectiveness depends on the person's possession of the goods. (b) A possessory lien on goods has priority over a security interest in the goods unless the lien is created by a statute that expressly provides otherwise. Section 9-334. (a) A security interest under this article may be created in goods that are fixtures or may continue in goods that become fixtures. A security interest does not exist under this article in ordinary building materials incorporated into an improvement on land. (b) This article does not prevent creation of an encumbrance upon fixtures under real property law. (c) In cases not governed by subsections (d) through (h), a security interest in fixtures is subordinate to a conflicting interest of an encumbrancer or owner of the related real property other than the debtor. (d) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h), a perfected security interest in fixtures has priority over a conflicting interest of an encumbrancer or owner of the real property if the debtor has an interest of record in or is in possession of the real property and: (1) the security interest is a purchase-money security interest; (2) the interest of the encumbrancer or owner arises before the goods become fixtures; and (3) the security interest is perfected by a fixture filing before the goods become fixtures or within 20 days thereafter. (e) A perfected security interest in fixtures has priority over a conflicting interest of an encumbrancer or owner of the real property if: (1) the debtor has an interest of record in the real property or is in possession of the real property and the security interest: (A) is perfected by a fixture filing before the interest of the encumbrancer or owner is of record; and (B) has priority over any conflicting interest of a predecessor in title of the encumbrancer or owner; (2) before the goods become fixtures, the security interest is perfected by any method permitted by this article and the fixtures are readily removable: (A) factory or office machines; (B) equipment that is not primarily used or leased for use in the operation of the real property; or (C) replacements of domestic appliances that are consumer goods; (3) the conflicting interest is a lien on the real property obtained by legal or equitable proceedings after the security interest was perfected by any method permitted by this article; or (4) the security interest is: (A) created in a manufactured home in a manufactured-home transaction; and (B) perfected pursuant to a statute described in Section 9-311(a)(2). (f) A security interest in fixtures, whether or not perfected, has priority over a conflicting interest of an encumbrancer or owner of the real property if: (1) the encumbrancer or owner has, in an authenticated record, consented to the security interest or disclaimed an interest in the goods as fixtures; or (2) the debtor has a right to remove the goods as against the encumbrancer or owner. (g) The priority of the security interest under paragraph (f)(2) continues for a reasonable time if the debtor's right to remove the goods as against the encumbrancer or owner terminates. (h) A mortgage is a construction mortgage to the extent that it secures an obligation incurred for the construction of an improvement on land, including the acquisition cost of the land, if a recorded record of the mortgage so indicates. Except as otherwise provided in subsections (e) and (f), a security interest in fixtures is subordinate to a construction mortgage if a record of the mortgage is recorded before the goods become fixtures and the goods become fixtures before the completion of the construction. A mortgage has this priority to the same extent as a construction mortgage to the extent that it is given to refinance a construction mortgage. (i) A perfected security interest in crops growing on real property has priority over a conflicting interest of an encumbrancer or owner of the real property if the debtor has an interest of record in or is in possession of the real property. (j) Subsection (i) prevails over any inconsistent statute. Section 9-335. (a) A security interest may be created in an accession and continues in collateral that becomes an accession. (b) If a security interest is perfected when the collateral becomes an accession, the security interest remains perfected in the collateral. (c) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (d), the other provisions of this part determine the priority of a security interest in an accession. (d) A security interest in an accession is subordinate to a security interest in the whole which is perfected by compliance with the requirements of a certificate-of-title statute under Section 9-311(b). (e) After default, subject to Part 6, a secured party may remove an accession from other goods if the security interest in the accession has priority over the claims of every person having an interest in the whole. (f) A secured party that removes an accession from other goods under subsection (e) shall promptly reimburse any holder of a security interest or other lien on, or owner of, the whole or of the other goods, other than the debtor, for the cost of repair of any physical injury to the whole or the other goods. The secured party need not reimburse the holder or owner for any diminution in value of the whole or the other goods caused by the absence of the accession removed or by any necessity for replacing it. A person entitled to reimbursement may refuse permission to remove until the secured party gives adequate assurance for the performance of the obligation to reimburse. Section 9-336. (a) In this section, \"commingled goods\" means goods that are physically united with other goods in such a manner that their identity is lost in a product or mass. (b) A security interest does not exist in commingled goods as such. However, a security interest may attach to a product or mass that results when goods become commingled goods. (c) If collateral becomes commingled goods, a security interest attaches to the product or mass. (d) If a security interest in collateral is perfected before the collateral becomes commingled goods, the security interest that attaches to the product or mass under subsection (c) is perfected. (e) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (f), the other provisions of this part determine the priority of a security interest that attaches to the product or mass under subsection (c). (f) If more than one security interest attaches to the product or mass under subsection (c), the following rules determine priority: (1) A security interest that is perfected under subsection (d) has priority over a security interest that is unperfected at the time the collateral becomes commingled goods. (2) If more than one security interest is perfected under subsection (d), the security interests rank equally in proportion to the value of the collateral at the time it became commingled goods. Section 9-337. If, while a security interest in goods is perfected by any method under the law of another jurisdiction, this State issues a certificate of title that does not show that the goods are subject to the security interest or contain a statement that they may be subject to security interests not shown on the certificate: (1) a buyer of the goods, other than a person in the business of selling goods of that kind, takes free of the security interest if the buyer gives value and receives delivery of the goods after issuance of the certificate and without knowledge of the security interest; and (2) the security interest is subordinate to a conflicting security interest in the goods that attaches, and is perfected under Section 9-311(b), after issuance of the certificate and without the conflicting secured party's knowledge of the security interest. Section 9-338. If a security interest or agricultural lien is perfected by a filed financing statement providing information described in Section 9-516(b)(5) which is incorrect at the time the financing statement is filed: (1) the security interest or agricultural lien is subordinate to a conflicting perfected security interest in the collateral to the extent that the holder of the conflicting security interest gives value in reasonable reliance upon the incorrect information; and (2) a purchaser, other than a secured party, of the collateral takes free of the security interest or agricultural lien to the extent that, in reasonable reliance upon the incorrect information, the purchaser gives value and, in the case of chattel paper, documents, goods, instruments, or a security certificate, receives delivery of the collateral. Section 9-339. This article does not preclude subordination by agreement by a person entitled to priority. Section 9-340. (a) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c), a bank with which a deposit account is maintained may exercise any right of recoupment or set-off against a secured party that holds a security interest in the deposit account. (b) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c), the application of this article to a security interest in a deposit account does not affect a right of recoupment or set-off of the secured party as to a deposit account maintained with the secured party. (c) The exercise by a bank of a set-off against a deposit account is ineffective against a secured party that holds a security interest in the deposit account which is perfected by control under Section 9-104(a)(3), if the set-off is based on a claim against the debtor. Section 9-341. Except as otherwise provided in Section 9-340(c), and unless the bank otherwise agrees in an authenticated record, a bank's rights and duties with respect to a deposit account maintained with the bank are not terminated, suspended, or modified by: (1) the creation, attachment, or perfection of a security interest in the deposit account; (2) the bank's knowledge of the security interest; or (3) the bank's receipt of instructions from the secured party. Section 9-342. This article does not require a bank to enter into an agreement of the kind described in Section 9-104(a)(2), even if its customer so requests or directs. A bank that has entered into such an agreement is not required to confirm the existence of the agreement to another person unless requested to do so by its customer. Section 9-401. (a) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b) and Sections 9-406, 9-407, 9-408, and 9-409, whether a debtor's rights in collateral may be voluntarily or involuntarily transferred is governed by law other than this article. (b) An agreement between the debtor and secured party which prohibits a transfer of the debtor's rights in collateral or makes the transfer a default does not prevent the transfer from taking effect. Section 9-402. The existence of a security interest, agricultural lien, or authority given to a debtor to dispose of or use collateral, without more, does not subject a secured party to liability in contract or tort for the debtor's acts or omissions. Section 9-403. (a) In this section, \"value\" has the meaning provided in Section 3-303(a). (b) Except as otherwise provided in this section, an agreement between an account debtor and an assignor not to assert against an assignee any claim or defense that the account debtor may have against the assignor is enforceable by an assignee that takes an assignment: (1) for value; (2) in good faith; (3) without notice of a claim of a property or possessory right to the property assigned; and (4) without notice of a defense or claim in recoupment of the type that may be asserted against a person entitled to enforce a negotiable instrument under Section 3-305(a). (c) Subsection (b) does not apply to defenses of a type that may be asserted against a holder in due course of a negotiable instrument under Section 3-305(b). (d) In a consumer transaction, if a record evidences the account debtor's obligation, law other than this article requires that the record include a statement to the effect that the rights of an assignee are subject to claims or defenses that the account debtor could assert against the original obligee, and the record does not include such a statement: (1) the record has the same effect as if the record included such a statement; and (2) the account debtor may assert against an assignee those claims and defenses that would have been available if the record included such a statement. (e) This section is subject to law other than this article which establishes a different rule for an account debtor who is an individual and who incurred the obligation primarily for personal, family, or household purposes. (f) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (d), this section does not displace law other than this article which gives effect to an agreement by an account debtor not to assert a claim or defense against an assignee. Section 9-404. (a) Unless an account debtor has made an enforceable agreement not to assert defenses or claims, and subject to subsections (b) through (e), the rights of an assignee are subject to: (1) all terms of the agreement between the account debtor and assignor and any defense or claim in recoupment arising from the transaction that gave rise to the contract; and (2) any other defense or claim of the account debtor against the assignor which accrues before the account debtor receives a notification of the assignment authenticated by the assignor or the assignee. (b) Subject to subsection (c) and except as otherwise provided in subsection (d), the claim of an account debtor against an assignor may be asserted against an assignee under subsection (a) only to reduce the amount the account debtor owes. (c) This section is subject to law other than this article which establishes a different rule for an account debtor who is an individual and who incurred the obligation primarily for personal, family, or household purposes. (d) In a consumer transaction, if a record evidences the account debtor's obligation, law other than this article requires that the record include a statement to the effect that the account debtor's recovery against an assignee with respect to claims and defenses against the assignor may not exceed amounts paid by the account debtor under the record, and the record does not include such a statement, the extent to which a claim of an account debtor against the assignor may be asserted against an assignee is determined as if the record included such a statement. (e) This section does not apply to an assignment of a health-care-insurance receivable. Section 9-405. (a) A modification of or substitution for an assigned contract is effective against an assignee if made in good faith. The assignee acquires corresponding rights under the modified or substituted contract. The assignment may provide that the modification or substitution is a breach of contract by the assignor. This subsection is subject to subsections (b) through (d). (b) Subsection (a) applies to the extent that: (1) the right to payment or a part thereof under an assigned contract has not been fully earned by performance; or (2) the right to payment or a part thereof has been fully earned by performance and the account debtor has not received notification of the assignment under Section 9-406(a). (c) This section is subject to law other than this article which establishes a different rule for an account debtor who is an individual and who incurred the obligation primarily for personal, family, or household purposes. (d) This section does not apply to an assignment of a health-care-insurance receivable. Section 9-406. (a) Subject to subsections (b) through (i), an account debtor on an account, chattel paper, or a payment intangible may discharge its obligation by paying the assignor until, but not after, the account debtor receives a notification, authenticated by the assignor or the assignee, that the amount due or to become due has been assigned and that payment is to be made to the assignee. After receipt of the notification, the account debtor may discharge its obligation by paying the assignee and may not discharge the obligation by paying the assignor. (b) Subject to subsection (h), notification is ineffective under subsection (a): (1) if it does not reasonably identify the rights assigned; (2) to the extent that an agreement between an account debtor and a seller of a payment intangible limits the account debtor's duty to pay a person other than the seller and the limitation is effective under law other than this article; or (3) at the option of an account debtor, if the notification notifies the account debtor to make less than the full amount of any installment or other periodic payment to the assignee, even if: (A) only a portion of the account, chattel paper, or payment intangible has been assigned to that assignee; (B) a portion has been assigned to another assignee; or (C) the account debtor knows that the assignment to that assignee is limited. (c) Subject to subsection (h), if requested by the account debtor, an assignee shall seasonably furnish reasonable proof that the assignment has been made. Unless the assignee complies, the account debtor may discharge its obligation by paying the assignor, even if the account debtor has received a notification under subsection (a). (d) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (e) and Sections 2A-303 and 9-407, and subject to subsection (h), a term in an agreement between an account debtor and an assignor or in a promissory note is ineffective to the extent that it: (1) prohibits, restricts, or requires the consent of the account debtor or person obligated on the promissory note to the assignment or transfer of, or the creation, attachment, perfection, or enforcement of a security interest in, the account, chattel paper, payment intangible, or promissory note; or (2) provides that the assignment or transfer or the creation, attachment, perfection, or enforcement of the security interest may give rise to a default, breach, right of recoupment, claim, defense, termination, right of termination, or remedy under the account, chattel paper, payment intangible, or promissory note. (e) Subsection (d) does not apply to the sale of a payment intangible or promissory note. (f) Except as otherwise provided in Sections 2A-303 and 9-407 and subject to subsections (h) and (i), a rule of law, statute, or regulation that prohibits, restricts, or requires the consent of a government, governmental body or official, or account debtor to the assignment or transfer of, or creation of a security interest in, an account or chattel paper is ineffective to the extent that the rule of law, statute, or regulation: (1) prohibits, restricts, or requires the consent of the government, governmental body or official, or account debtor to the assignment or transfer of, or the creation, attachment, perfection, or enforcement of a security interest in the account or chattel paper; or (2) provides that the assignment or transfer or the creation, attachment, perfection, or enforcement of the security interest may give rise to a default, breach, right of recoupment, claim, defense, termination, right of termination, or remedy under the account or chattel paper. (g) Subject to subsection (h), an account debtor may not waive or vary its option under subsection (b)(3). (h) This section is subject to law other than this article which establishes a different rule for an account debtor who is an individual and who incurred the obligation primarily for personal, family, or household purposes. (i) This section does not apply to an assignment of a health-care-insurance receivable. (j) This section prevails over any inconsistent statute. Section 9-407. (a) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b), a term in a lease agreement is ineffective to the extent that it: (1) prohibits, restricts, or requires the consent of a party to the lease to the assignment or transfer of, or the creation, attachment, perfection, or enforcement of a security interest in, an interest of a party under the lease contract or in the lessor's residual interest in the goods; or (2) provides that the assignment or transfer or the creation, attachment, perfection, or enforcement of the security interest may give rise to a default, breach, right of recoupment, claim, defense, termination, right of termination, or remedy under the lease. (b) Except as otherwise provided in Section 2A-303(7), a term described in subsection (a)(2) is effective to the extent that there is: (1) a transfer by the lessee of the lessee's right of possession or use of the goods in violation of the term; or (2) a delegation of a material performance of either party to the lease contract in violation of the term. (c) The creation, attachment, perfection, or enforcement of a security interest in the lessor's interest under the lease contract or the lessor's residual interest in the goods is not a transfer that materially impairs the lessee's prospect of obtaining return performance or materially changes the duty of or materially increases the burden or risk imposed on the lessee within the purview of Section 2A-303(4) unless, and then only to the extent that, enforcement actually results in a delegation of material performance of the lessor. Section 9-408. (a) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b), a term in a promissory note or in an agreement between an account debtor and a debtor which relates to a health-care- insurance receivable or a general intangible, including a contract, permit, license, or franchise, and which term prohibits, restricts, or requires the consent of the person obligated on the promissory note or the account debtor to, the assignment or transfer of, or creation, attachment, or perfection of a security interest in, the promissory note, health-care-insurance receivable, or general intangible, is ineffective to the extent that the term: (1) would impair the creation, attachment, or perfection of a security interest; or (2) provides that the assignment or transfer or the creation, attachment, or perfection of the security interest may give rise to a default, breach, right of recoupment, claim, defense, termination, right of termination, or remedy under the promissory note, health-care-insurance receivable, or general intangible. (b) Subsection (a) applies to a security interest in a payment intangible or promissory note only if the security interest arises out of a sale of the payment intangible or promissory note. (c) A rule of law, statute, or regulation that prohibits, restricts, or requires the consent of a government, governmental body or official, person obligated on a promissory note, or account debtor to the assignment or transfer of, or creation of a security interest in, a promissory note, health-care-insurance receivable, or general intangible, including a contract, permit, license, or franchise between an account debtor and a debtor, is ineffective to the extent that the rule of law, statute, or regulation: (1) would impair the creation, attachment, or perfection of a security interest; or (2) provides that the assignment or transfer or the creation, attachment, or perfection of the security interest may give rise to a default, breach, right of recoupment, claim, defense, termination, right of termination, or remedy under the promissory note, health-care-insurance receivable, or general intangible. (d) To the extent that a term in a promissory note or in an agreement between an account debtor and a debtor which relates to a health-care-insurance receivable or general intangible or a rule of law, statute, or regulation described in subsection (c) would be effective under law other than this article but is ineffective under subsection (a) or (c), the creation, attachment, or perfection of a security interest in the promissory note, health-care-insurance receivable, or general intangible: (1) is not enforceable against the person obligated on the promissory note or the account debtor; (2) does not impose a duty or obligation on the person obligated on the promissory note or the account debtor; (3) does not require the person obligated on the promissory note or the account debtor to recognize the security interest, pay or render performance to the secured party, or accept payment or performance from the secured party; (4) does not entitle the secured party to use or assign the debtor's rights under the promissory note, health-care-insurance receivable, or general intangible, including any related information or materials furnished to the debtor in the transaction giving rise to the promissory note, health-care-insurance receivable, or general intangible; (5) does not entitle the secured party to use, assign, possess, or have access to any trade secrets or confidential information of the person obligated on the promissory note or the account debtor; and (6) does not entitle the secured party to enforce the security interest in the promissory note, health-care-insurance receivable, or general intangible. (e) This section prevails over any inconsistent statute. Section 9-409. (a) A term in a letter of credit or a rule of law, statute, regulation, custom, or practice applicable to the letter of credit which prohibits, restricts, or requires the consent of an applicant, issuer, or nominated person to a beneficiary's assignment of or creation of a security interest in a letter-of-credit right is ineffective to the extent that the term or rule of law, statute, regulation, custom, or practice: (1) would impair the creation, attachment, or perfection of a security interest in the letter- of-credit right; or (2) provides that the assignment or the creation, attachment, or perfection of the security interest may give rise to a default, breach, right of recoupment, claim, defense, termination, right of termination, or remedy under the letter-of-credit right. (b) To the extent that a term in a letter of credit is ineffective under subsection (a) but would be effective under law other than this article or a custom or practice applicable to the letter of credit, to the transfer of a right to draw or otherwise demand performance under the letter of credit, or to the assignment of a right to proceeds of the letter of credit, the creation, attachment, or perfection of a security interest in the letter-of-credit right: (1) is not enforceable against the applicant, issuer, nominated person, or transferee beneficiary; (2) imposes no duties or obligations on the applicant, issuer, nominated person, or transferee beneficiary; and (3) does not require the applicant, issuer, nominated person, or transferee beneficiary to recognize the security interest, pay or render performance to the secured party, or accept payment or other performance from the secured party. Section 9-501. (a) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b), if the local law of this State governs perfection of a security interest or agricultural lien, the office in which to file a financing statement to perfect the security interest or agricultural lien is: (1) the office designated for the filing or recording of a record of a mortgage on the related real property, if: (A) the collateral is as-extracted collateral or timber to be cut; or (B) the financing statement is filed as a fixture filing and the collateral is goods that are or are to become fixtures; or (2) the office of the secretary of state, in all other cases, including a case in which the collateral is goods that are or are to become fixtures and the financing statement is not filed as a fixture filing. (b) The office in which to file a financing statement to perfect a security interest in collateral, including fixtures, of a transmitting utility is the office of the secretary of state. The financing statement also constitutes a fixture filing as to the collateral indicated in the financing statement which is or is to become fixtures. Section 9-501.1. All statements to continue, release, assign, amend or terminate any financing statements filed subsequent to December 31, 1979, and prior to July 1, 1980, notwithstanding any noncompliance with \u00a7 57A-9-401.1 as amended, are hereby cured, legalized and validated as fully as if such filings had been made in full compliance with \u00a7 57A-9-401.1. Section 9-502. (a) Subject to subsection (b), a financing statement is sufficient only if it: (1) provides the name of the debtor and either the social security number or the internal revenue service taxpayer identification number of the debtor; (2) provides the name of the secured party or a representative of the secured party; and (3) indicates the collateral covered by the financing statement. (b) Except as otherwise provided in Section 9-501(b), to be sufficient, a financing statement that covers as-extracted collateral or timber to be cut, or which is filed as a fixture filing and covers goods that are or are to become fixtures, must satisfy subsection (a) and also: (1) indicate that it covers this type of collateral; (2) indicate that it is to be filed for record in the real property records; (3) provide a description of the real property to which the collateral is related sufficient to give constructive notice of a mortgage under the law of this State if the description were contained in a record of the mortgage of the real property. A financing statement covering timber to be cut or covering minerals or the like (including oil and gas) or accounts subject to Section 9-301, or a financing statement filed as a fixture filing where the debtor is not a transmitting utility, must show that it covers this type of collateral, must recite that it is to be filed for record in the real estate records, and the financing statement must contain a description of the real estate sufficient if it were contained in a mortgage of the real estate to give constructive notice of the mortgage under the law of this state. If the debtor does not have an interest of record in the real estate, the financing statement must show the name of a record owner. No description of the real estate or the name of the record owner thereof is required for a fixture filing where the debtor is a transmitting utility; and (4) if the debtor does not have an interest of record in the real property, provide the name of a record owner. (c) A record of a mortgage is effective, from the date of recording, as a financing statement filed as a fixture filing or as a financing statement covering as-extracted collateral or timber to be cut only if: (1) the record indicates the goods or accounts that it covers; (2) the goods are or are to become fixtures related to the real property described in the record or the collateral is related to the real property described in the record and is as- extracted collateral or timber to be cut; (3) the record satisfies the requirements for a financing statement in this section other than an indication that it is to be filed in the real property records; and (4) the record is recorded. (d) A financing statement may be filed before a security agreement is made or a security interest otherwise attaches. Section 9-503. (a) A financing statement sufficiently provides the name of the debtor: (1) if the debtor is a registered organization, only if the financing statement provides the name of the debtor indicated on the public record of the debtor's jurisdiction of organization which shows the debtor to have been organized; (2) if the debtor is a decedent's estate, only if the financing statement provides the name of the decedent and indicates that the debtor is an estate; (3) if the debtor is a trust or a trustee acting with respect to property held in trust, only if the financing statement: (A) provides the name specified for the trust in its organic documents or, if no name is specified, provides the name of the settlor and additional information sufficient to distinguish the debtor from other trusts having one or more of the same settlors; and (B) indicates, in the debtor's name or otherwise, that the debtor is a trust or is a trustee acting with respect to property held in trust; and (4) in other cases: (A) if the debtor has a name, only if it provides the individual or organizational name of the debtor; and (B) if the debtor does not have a name, only if it provides the names of the partners, members, associates, or other persons comprising the debtor. (b) A financing statement that provides the name of the debtor in accordance with subsection (a) is not rendered ineffective by the absence of: (1) a trade name or other name of the debtor; or (2) unless required under subsection (a)(4)(B), names of partners, members, associates, or other persons comprising the debtor. (c) A financing statement that provides only the debtor's trade name does not sufficiently provide the name of the debtor. (d) Failure to indicate the representative capacity of a secured party or representative of a secured party does not affect the sufficiency of a financing statement. (e) A financing statement may provide the name of more than one debtor and the name of more than one secured party. Section 9-504. A financing statement sufficiently indicates the collateral that it covers if the financing statement provides: (1) a description of the collateral pursuant to Section 9-108; or (2) an indication that the financing statement covers all assets or all personal property. Section 9-505. (a) A consignor, lessor, or other bailor of goods, a licensor, or a buyer of a payment intangible or promissory note may file a financing statement, or may comply with a statute or treaty described in Section 9-311(a), using the terms \"consignor\", \"consignee\", \"lessor\", \"lessee\", \"bailor\", \"bailee\", \"licensor\", \"licensee\", \"owner\", \"registered owner\", \"buyer\", \"seller\", or words of similar import, instead of the terms \"secured party\" and \"debtor\". (b) This part applies to the filing of a financing statement under subsection (a) and, as appropriate, to compliance that is equivalent to filing a financing statement under Section 9-311(b), but the filing or compliance is not of itself a factor in determining whether the collateral secures an obligation. If it is determined for another reason that the collateral secures an obligation, a security interest held by the consignor, lessor, bailor, licensor, owner, or buyer which attaches to the collateral is perfected by the filing or compliance. Section 9-506. (a) A financing statement substantially satisfying the requirements of this part is effective, even if it has minor errors or omissions, unless the errors or omissions make the financing statement seriously misleading. (b) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c), a financing statement that fails sufficiently to provide the name of the debtor in accordance with Section 9-503(a) is seriously misleading. (c) If a search of the records of the filing office under the debtor's correct name, using the filing office's standard search logic, if any, would disclose a financing statement that fails sufficiently to provide the name of the debtor in accordance with Section 9-503(a), the name provided does not make the financing statement seriously misleading. (d) For purposes of Section 9-508(b), the \"debtor's correct name\" in subsection (c) means the correct name of the new debtor. Section 9-507. (a) A filed financing statement remains effective with respect to collateral that is sold, exchanged, leased, licensed, or otherwise disposed of and in which a security interest or agricultural lien continues, even if the secured party knows of or consents to the disposition. (b) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c) and Section 9-508, a financing statement is not rendered ineffective if, after the financing statement is filed, the information provided in the financing statement becomes seriously misleading under Section 9-506. (c) If a debtor so changes its name that a filed financing statement becomes seriously misleading under Section 9-506: (1) the financing statement is effective to perfect a security interest in collateral acquired by the debtor before, or within four months after, the change; and (2) the financing statement is not effective to perfect a security interest in collateral acquired by the debtor more than four months after the change, unless an amendment to the financing statement which renders the financing statement not seriously misleading is filed within four months after the change. Section 9-508. (a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, a filed financing statement naming an original debtor is effective to perfect a security interest in collateral in which a new debtor has or acquires rights to the extent that the financing statement would have been effective had the original debtor acquired rights in the collateral. (b) If the difference between the name of the original debtor and that of the new debtor causes a filed financing statement that is effective under subsection (a) to be seriously misleading under Section 9-506: (1) the financing statement is effective to perfect a security interest in collateral acquired by the new debtor before, and within four months after, the new debtor becomes bound under Section 9-203(d); and (2) the financing statement is not effective to perfect a security interest in collateral acquired by the new debtor more than four months after the new debtor becomes bound under Section 9-203(d) unless an initial financing statement providing the name of the new debtor is filed before the expiration of that time. (c) This section does not apply to collateral as to which a filed financing statement remains effective against the new debtor under Section 9-507(a). Section 9-509. (a) A person may file an initial financing statement, amendment that adds collateral covered by a financing statement, or amendment that adds a debtor to a financing statement only if: (1) the debtor authorizes the filing in an authenticated record or pursuant to subsection (b) or (c); or (2) the person holds an agricultural lien that has become effective at the time of filing and the financing statement covers only collateral in which the person holds an agricultural lien. (b) By authenticating or becoming bound as debtor by a security agreement, a debtor or new debtor authorizes the filing of an initial financing statement, and an amendment, covering: (1) the collateral described in the security agreement; and (2) property that becomes collateral under Section 9-315(a)(2), whether or not the security agreement expressly covers proceeds. (c) By acquiring collateral in which a security interest or agricultural lien continues under Section 9-315(a)(1), a debtor authorizes the filing of an initial financing statement, and an amendment, covering the collateral and property that becomes collateral under Section 9- 315(a)(2). (d) A person may file an amendment other than an amendment that adds collateral covered by a financing statement or an amendment that adds a debtor to a financing statement only if: (1) the secured party of record authorizes the filing; or (2) the amendment is a termination statement for a financing statement as to which the secured party of record has failed to file or send a termination statement as required by Section 9-513(a) or (c), the debtor authorizes the filing, and the termination statement indicates that the debtor authorized it to be filed. (e) If there is more than one secured party of record for a financing statement, each secured party of record may authorize the filing of an amendment under subsection (d). Section 9-510. (a) A filed record is effective only to the extent that it was filed by a person that may file it under Section 9-509. (b) A record authorized by one secured party of record does not affect the financing statement with respect to another secured party of record. (c) A continuation statement that is not filed within the period prescribed by Section 9-515(d) is ineffective. Section 9-511. (a) A secured party of record with respect to a financing statement is a person whose name is provided as the name of the secured party or a representative of the secured party in an initial financing statement that has been filed. If an initial financing statement is filed under Section 9-514(a), the assignee named in the initial financing statement is the secured party of record with respect to the financing statement. (b) If an amendment of a financing statement which provides the name of a person as a secured party or a representative of a secured party is filed, the person named in the amendment is a secured party of record. If an amendment is filed under Section 9-514(b), the assignee named in the amendment is a secured party of record. (c) A person remains a secured party of record until the filing of an amendment of the financing statement which deletes the person. Section 9-512. (a) Subject to Section 9-509, a person may add or delete collateral covered by, continue or terminate the effectiveness of, or, subject to subsection (e), otherwise amend the information provided in, a financing statement by filing an amendment that: (1) identifies, by its file number, the initial financing statement to which the amendment relates and either the social security number or internal revenue service taxpayer identification number of the debtor; and (2) if the amendment relates to an initial financing statement filed or recorded in a filing office described in Section 9-501(a)(1), provides the date and time that the initial financing statement was filed or recorded and the information specified in Section 9- 502(b). (b) Except as otherwise provided in Section 9-515, the filing of an amendment does not extend the period of effectiveness of the financing statement. (c) A financing statement that is amended by an amendment that adds collateral is effective as to the added collateral only from the date of the filing of the amendment. (d) A financing statement that is amended by an amendment that adds a debtor is effective as to the added debtor only from the date of the filing of the amendment. (e) An amendment is ineffective to the extent it: (1) purports to delete all debtors and fails to provide the name of a debtor to be covered by the financing statement; or (2) purports to delete all secured parties of record and fails to provide the name of a new secured party of record. Section 9-513. (a) A secured party shall cause the secured party of record for a financing statement to file a termination statement for the financing statement if the financing statement covers consumer goods and: (1) there is no obligation secured by the collateral covered by the financing statement and no commitment to make an advance, incur an obligation, or otherwise give value; or (2) the debtor did not authorize the filing of the initial financing statement. (b) To comply with subsection (a), a secured party shall cause the secured party of record to file the termination statement: (1) within one month after there is no obligation secured by the collateral covered by the financing statement and no commitment to make an advance, incur an obligation, or otherwise give value; or (2) if earlier, within 20 days after the secured party receives an authenticated demand from a debtor. (c) In cases not governed by subsection (a), within 20 days after a secured party receives an authenticated demand from a debtor, the secured party shall cause the secured party of record for a financing statement to send to the debtor a termination statement for the financing statement or file the termination statement in the filing office if: (1) except in the case of a financing statement covering accounts or chattel paper that has been sold or goods that are the subject of a consignment, there is no obligation secured by the collateral covered by the financing statement and no commitment to make an advance, incur an obligation, or otherwise give value; (2) the financing statement covers accounts or chattel paper that has been sold but as to which the account debtor or other person obligated has discharged its obligation; (3) the financing statement covers goods that were the subject of a consignment to the debtor but are not in the debtor's possession; or (4) the debtor did not authorize the filing of the initial financing statement. (d) Except as otherwise provided in Section 9-510, upon the filing of a termination statement with the filing office, the financing statement to which the termination statement relates ceases to be effective. Except as otherwise provided in Section 9-510, for purposes of Sections 9- 519(g), 9-522(a), and 9-523(c), the filing with the filing office of a termination statement relating to a financing statement that indicates that the debtor is a transmitting utility also causes the effectiveness of the financing statement to lapse. Section 9-514. (a) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c), an initial financing statement may reflect an assignment of all of the secured party's power to authorize an amendment to the financing statement by providing the name and mailing address of the assignee as the name and address of the secured party. (b) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c), a secured party of record may assign of record all or part of its power to authorize an amendment to a financing statement by filing in the filing office an amendment of the financing statement which: (1) identifies, by its file number, the initial financing statement to which it relates; (2) provides the name of the assignor; and (3) provides the name and mailing address of the assignee. (c) An assignment of record of a security interest in a fixture covered by a record of a mortgage which is effective as a financing statement filed as a fixture filing under Section 9-502(c) may be made only by an assignment of record of the mortgage in the manner provided by law of this State other than the Uniform Commercial Code. Section 9-515. (a) Except as otherwise provided in subsections (b), (e), (f), and (g), a filed financing statement is effective for a period of five years after the date of filing. Financing statements filed before July 1, 1997, are effective for a period of five years from the date of filing and thereafter for a period of 60 days. The expiration date established by a financing statement filed prior to July 1, 1997, whether or not continued by a continuation statement shall remain in full force and effect and is not diminished by any subsequent amendments to this Act. (b) Except as otherwise provided in subsections (e), (f), and (g), an initial financing statement filed in connection with a public-finance transaction or manufactured-home transaction is effective for a period of 30 years after the date of filing if it indicates that it is filed in connection with a public-finance transaction or manufactured-home transaction. (c) The effectiveness of a filed financing statement lapses on the expiration of the period of its effectiveness unless before the lapse a continuation statement is filed pursuant to subsection (d). Upon lapse, a financing statement ceases to be effective and any security interest or agricultural lien that was perfected by the financing statement becomes unperfected, unless the security interest is perfected otherwise. If the security interest or agricultural lien becomes unperfected upon lapse, it is deemed never to have been perfected as against a purchaser of the collateral for value. (d) A continuation statement may be filed only within six months before the expiration of the five-year period specified in subsection (a) or the 30-year period specified in subsection (b), whichever is applicable. However, for financing statements filed before July 1, 1997, a continuation statement may be filed within six months before and 60 days after the expiration of the five-year period. (e) Except as otherwise provided in Section 9-510, upon timely filing of a continuation statement, the effectiveness of the initial financing statement continues for a period of five years and, for initial financing statements filed before July 1, 1997, the effectiveness of the initial financing statement continues for a period of five years and sixty days, commencing on the day on which the financing statement would have become ineffective in the absence of the filing. Upon the expiration of the five-year period, the financing statement lapses in the same manner as provided in subsection (c), unless, before the lapse, another continuation statement is filed pursuant to subsection (d). Succeeding continuation statements may be filed in the same manner to continue the effectiveness of the initial financing statement. (f) If a debtor is a transmitting utility and a filed financing statement so indicates, the financing statement is effective until a termination statement is filed. (g) A record of a mortgage that is effective as a financing statement filed as a fixture filing under Section 9-502(c) remains effective as a financing statement filed as a fixture filing until the mortgage is released or satisfied of record or its effectiveness otherwise terminates as to the real property. Section 9-516. (a) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b), communication of a record to a filing office and tender of the filing fee or acceptance of the record by the filing office constitutes filing. (b) Filing does not occur with respect to a record that a filing office refuses to accept because: (1) the record is not communicated by a method or medium of communication authorized by the filing office; (2) an amount equal to or greater than the applicable filing fee is not tendered; (3) the filing office is unable to index the record because: (A) in the case of an initial financing statement, the record does not provide a name for the debtor; (B) in the case of an amendment or correction statement, the record: (i) does not identify the initial financing statement as required by Section 9-512 or 9-518, as applicable; or (ii) identifies an initial financing statement whose effectiveness has lapsed under Section 9-515; (C) in the case of an initial financing statement that provides the name of a debtor identified as an individual or an amendment that provides a name of a debtor identified as an individual which was not previously provided in the financing statement to which the record relates, the record does not identify the debtor's last name; or (D) in the case of a record filed or recorded in the filing office described in Section 9-501(a)(1), the record does not provide a sufficient description of the real property to which it relates; (4) in the case of an initial financing statement or an amendment that adds a secured party of record, the record does not provide a name and mailing address for the secured party of record; (5) in the case of an initial financing statement or an amendment that provides a name of a debtor which was not previously provided in the financing statement to which the amendment relates, the record does not: (A) provide a mailing address for the debtor; (B) indicate whether the debtor is an individual or an organization; or (C) if the financing statement indicates that the debtor is an organization, provide: (i) a type of organization for the debtor; (ii) a jurisdiction of organization for the debtor; or (iii) an organizational identification number for the debtor or indicate that the debtor has none; (6) in the case of an assignment reflected in an initial financing statement under Section 9-514(a) or an amendment filed under Section 9-514(b), the record does not provide a name and mailing address for the assignee; or (7) in the case of a continuation statement, the record is not filed within the six-month period prescribed by Section 9-515(d). (c) For purposes of subsection (b): (1) a record does not provide information if the filing office is unable to read or decipher the information; and (2) a record that does not indicate that it is an amendment or identify an initial financing statement to which it relates, as required by Section 9-512, 9-514, or 9-518, is an initial financing statement. (d) A record that is communicated to the filing office with tender of the filing fee, but which the filing office refuses to accept for a reason other than one set forth in subsection (b), is effective as a filed record except as against a purchaser of the collateral which gives value in reasonable reliance upon the absence of the record from the files. Section 9-517. The failure of the filing office to index a record correctly does not affect the effectiveness of the filed record. Section 9-518. (a) A person may file in the filing office a correction statement with respect to a record indexed there under the person's name if the person believes that the record is inaccurate or was wrongfully filed. (b) A correction statement must: (1) identify the record to which it relates by: (A) the file number assigned to the initial financing statement to which the record relates; and (B) if the correction statement relates to a record filed or recorded in a filing office described in Section 9-501(a)(1), the date and time that the initial financing statement was filed or recorded and the information specified in Section 9- 502(b); (2) indicate that it is a correction statement; and (3) provide the basis for the person's belief that the record is inaccurate and indicate the manner in which the person believes the record should be amended to cure any inaccuracy or provide the basis for the person's belief that the record was wrongfully filed. (c) The filing of a correction statement does not affect the effectiveness of an initial financing statement or other filed record. Section 9-519. (a) For each record filed in a filing office, the filing office shall: (1) assign a unique number to the filed record; (2) create a record that bears the number assigned to the filed record and the date and time of filing; (3) maintain the filed record for public inspection; and (4) index the filed record in accordance with subsections (c), (d), and (e). (b) A file number assigned after July 1, 2001, must include a digit that: (1) is mathematically derived from or related to the other digits of the file number; and (2) aids the filing office in determining whether a number communicated as the file number includes a single-digit or transpositional error. (c) Except as otherwise provided in subsections (d) and (e), the filing office shall: (1) index an initial financing statement according to the name of the debtor and index all filed records relating to the initial financing statement in a manner that associates with one another an initial financing statement and all filed records relating to the initial financing statement; and (2) index a record that provides a name of a debtor which was not previously provided in the financing statement to which the record relates also according to the name that was not previously provided. (d) If a financing statement is filed as a fixture filing or covers as-extracted collateral or timber to be cut, it must be filed for record and the filing office shall index it: (1) under the names of the debtor and of each owner of record shown on the financing statement as if they were the mortgagors under a mortgage of the real property described; and (2) to the extent that the law of this State provides for indexing of records of mortgages under the name of the mortgagee, under the name of the secured party as if the secured party were the mortgagee thereunder, or, if indexing is by description, as if the financing statement were a record of a mortgage of the real property described. (e) If a financing statement is filed as a fixture filing or covers as-extracted collateral or timber to be cut, the filing office shall index an assignment filed under Section 9-514(a) or an amendment filed under Section 9-514(b): (1) under the name of the assignor as grantor; and (2) to the extent that the law of this State provides for indexing a record of the assignment of a mortgage under the name of the assignee, under the name of the assignee. (f) The filing office shall maintain a capability: (1) to retrieve a record by the name of the debtor and: (A) if the filing office is described in Section 9-501(a)(1), by the file number assigned to the initial financing statement to which the record relates and the date and time that the record was filed or recorded; or (B) if the filing office is described in Section 9-501(a)(2), by the file number assigned to the initial financing statement to which the record relates; and (2) to associate and retrieve with one another an initial financing statement and each filed record relating to the initial financing statement. (g) The filing office may not remove a debtor's name from the index until one year after the effectiveness of a financing statement naming the debtor lapses under Section 9-515 with respect to all secured parties of record. (h) The filing office shall perform the acts required by subsections (a) through (e) at the time and in the manner prescribed by filing-office rule, but not later than two business days after the filing office receives the record in question. (i) Subsections (b) and (h) do not apply to a filing office described in Section 9-501(a)(1). Section 9-520. (a) A filing office shall refuse to accept a record for filing for a reason set forth in Section 9-516(b) and may refuse to accept a record for filing only for a reason set forth in Section 9-516(b). (b) If a filing office refuses to accept a record for filing, it shall communicate to the person that presented the record the fact of and reason for the refusal and the date and time the record would have been filed had the filing office accepted it. The communication must be made at the time and in the manner prescribed by filing-office rule but, in the case of a filing office described in Section 9-501(a)(2), in no event more than two business days after the filing office receives the record. (c) A filed financing statement satisfying Section 9-502(a) and (b) is effective, even if the filing office is required to refuse to accept it for filing under subsection (a). However, Section 9-338 applies to a filed financing statement providing information described in Section 9- 516(b)(5) which is incorrect at the time the financing statement is filed. (d) If a record communicated to a filing office provides information that relates to more than one debtor, this part applies as to each debtor separately. Section 9-521. (a) A filing office that accepts written records may not refuse to accept a written initial financing statement in the following form and format except for a reason set forth in Section 9-516(b): (b) A filing office that accepts written records may not refuse to accept a written record in the following form and format except for a reason set forth in Section 9-516(b): Section 9-522. (a) The filing office shall maintain a record of the information provided in a filed financing statement for at least one year after the effectiveness of the financing statement has lapsed under Section 9-515 with respect to all secured parties of record. The record must be retrievable by using the name of the debtor and: (1) if the record was filed or recorded in the filing office described in Section 9-501(a)(1), by using the file number assigned to the initial financing statement to which the record relates and the date and time that the record was filed or recorded; or (2) if the record was filed in the filing office described in Section 9-501(a)(2), by using the file number assigned to the initial financing statement to which the record relates. (b) Except to the extent that a statute governing disposition of public records provides otherwise, the filing office immediately may destroy any written record evidencing a financing statement. However, if the filing office destroys a written record, it shall maintain another record of the financing statement which complies with subsection (a). Section 9-523. (a) If a person that files a written record requests an acknowledgment of the filing, the filing office shall send to the person an image of the record showing the number assigned to the record pursuant to Section 9-519(a)(1) and the date and time of the filing of the record. However, if the person furnishes a copy of the record to the filing office, the filing office may instead: (1) note upon the copy the number assigned to the record pursuant to Section 9-519(a)(1) and the date and time of the filing of the record; and (2) send the copy to the person. (b) If a person files a record other than a written record, the filing office shall communicate to the person an acknowledgment that provides: (1) the information in the record; (2) the number assigned to the record pursuant to Section 9-519(a)(1); and (3) the date and time of the filing of the record. (c) The filing office shall communicate or otherwise make available in a record the following information to any person that requests it: (1) whether there is on file on a date and time specified by the filing office, but not a date earlier than three business days before the filing office receives the request, any financing statement that: (A) designates a particular debtor or, if the request so states, designates a particular debtor at the address specified in the request; (B) has not lapsed under Section 9-515 with respect to all secured parties of record; and (C) if the request so states, has lapsed under Section 9-515 and a record of which is maintained by the filing office under Section 9-522(a); (2) the date and time of filing of each financing statement; and (3) the information provided in each financing statement. (d) In complying with its duty under subsection (c), the filing office may communicate information in any medium. However, if requested, the filing office shall communicate information by issuing a record that can be admitted into evidence in the courts of this State without extrinsic evidence of its authenticity. A computer printout from the centralized computer system established by the secretary of state constitutes the certificate of the secretary of state as to whether there is on file, on the date and hour stated thereon, a financing statement covering the following collateral: farm products or accounts, or livestock, or general intangibles arising from or relating to the sale of farm products by a farmer, or crops growing or to be grown, or equipment used in farming operations. The secretary of state shall, upon a telephone request, furnish to any person, company, or corporation, information as to whether a financing statement describing farm collateral has been filed in the office of the secretary of state and, if such financing statement has been filed, the secretary of state shall also furnish the name and business address of the secured creditor. However, the secretary of state need not answer telephone inquiries in writing nor send written confirmation from a telephone request. The secretary of state is not responsible for accuracy and completeness of the information furnished verbally in response to a telephone request. The secretary of state shall provide a toll-free telephone number to provide access for telephone requests. (e) The filing office shall perform the acts required by subsections (a) through (d) at the time and in the manner prescribed by filing-office rule, but not later than two business days after the filing office receives the request. Section 9-524. Delay by the filing office beyond a time limit prescribed by this part is excused if: (1) the delay is caused by interruption of communication or computer facilities, war, emergency conditions, failure of equipment, or other circumstances beyond control of the filing office; and (2) the filing office exercises reasonable diligence under the circumstances. Section 9-525.

Any person who for himself, or through an agent, sells livestock through a livestock auction agency, as defined in chapter 40-15 and \u00a7 301 of the Packers and Stockyards Act (7 USC 201), or who so sells grain through a public grain warehouse, or through a public terminal grain warehouse, or a grain dealer as defined in chapters 49-43, 49-44, and 49-45 respectively, without notifying the livestock auction agency or the grain warehouse or grain dealer of a security interest in such farm products, and with intent to defraud, is guilty of farm products fraud. The failure of the seller to give written notice of a security interest in the farm products prior to the date of the sale by the livestock auction agency, or the grain warehouse, or grain dealer, is prima facie evidence of intent to defraud. A violation of this section is a Class 1 misdemeanor. Section 9-610.

If a transfer statement is presented with the applicable fee and request form to the official or office responsible for maintaining the system, the official or office shall: (1) accept the transfer statement; (2) promptly amend its records to reflect the transfer; and (3) if applicable, issue a new appropriate certificate of title in the name of the transferee. (c) A transfer of the record or legal title to collateral to a secured party under subsection (b) or otherwise is not of itself a disposition of collateral under this article and does not of itself relieve the secured party of its duties under this article. Section 9-620. (a) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (g), a secured party may accept collateral in full or partial satisfaction of the obligation it secures only if: (1) the debtor consents to the acceptance under subsection (c); (2) the secured party does not receive, within the time set forth in subsection (d), a notification of objection to the proposal authenticated by: (A) a person to which the secured party was required to send a proposal under Section 9-621; or (B) any other person, other than the debtor, holding an interest in the collateral subordinate to the security interest that is the subject of the proposal; (3) if the collateral is consumer goods, the collateral is not in the possession of the debtor when the debtor consents to the acceptance; and (4) subsection (e) does not require the secured party to dispose of the collateral or the debtor waives the requirement pursuant to Section 9-624. (b) A purported or apparent acceptance of collateral under this section is ineffective unless: (1) the secured party consents to the acceptance in an authenticated record or sends a proposal to the debtor; and (2) the conditions of subsection (a) are met. (c) For purposes of this section: (1) a debtor consents to an acceptance of collateral in partial satisfaction of the obligation it secures only if the debtor agrees to the terms of the acceptance in a record authenticated after default; and (2) a debtor consents to an acceptance of collateral in full satisfaction of the obligation it secures only if the debtor agrees to the terms of the acceptance in a record authenticated after default or the secured party: (A) sends to the debtor after default a proposal that is unconditional or subject only to a condition that collateral not in the possession of the secured party be preserved or maintained; (B) in the proposal, proposes to accept collateral in full satisfaction of the obligation it secures; and (C) does not receive a notification of objection authenticated by the debtor within 20 days after the proposal is sent. (d) To be effective under subsection (a)(2), a notification of objection must be received by the secured party: (1) in the case of a person to which the proposal was sent pursuant to Section 9-621, within 20 days after notification was sent to that person; and (2) in other cases: (A) within 20 days after the last notification was sent pursuant to Section 9-621; or (B) if a notification was not sent, before the debtor consents to the acceptance under subsection (c). (e) A secured party that has taken possession of collateral shall dispose of the collateral pursuant to Section 9-610 within the time specified in subsection (f) if: (1) 60 percent of the cash price has been paid in the case of a purchase-money security interest in consumer goods; or (2) 60 percent of the principal amount of the obligation secured has been paid in the case of a non-purchase-money security interest in consumer goods. (f) To comply with subsection (e), the secured party shall dispose of the collateral: (1) within 90 days after taking possession; or (2) within any longer period to which the debtor and all secondary obligors have agreed in an agreement to that effect entered into and authenticated after default. (g) In a consumer transaction, a secured party may not accept collateral in partial satisfaction of the obligation it secures. Section 9-621. (a) A secured party that desires to accept collateral in full or partial satisfaction of the obligation it secures shall send its proposal to: (1) any person from which the secured party has received, before the debtor consented to the acceptance, an authenticated notification of a claim of an interest in the collateral; (2) any other secured party or lienholder that, 10 days before the debtor consented to the acceptance, held a security interest in or other lien on the collateral perfected by the filing of a financing statement that: (A) identified the collateral; (B) was indexed under the debtor's name as of that date; and (C) was filed in the office or offices in which to file a financing statement against the debtor covering the collateral as of that date; and (3) any other secured party that, 10 days before the debtor consented to the acceptance, held a security interest in the collateral perfected by compliance with a statute, regulation, or treaty described in Section 9-311(a). (b) A secured party that desires to accept collateral in partial satisfaction of the obligation it secures shall send its proposal to any secondary obligor in addition to the persons described in subsection (a). Section 9-622. (a) A secured party's acceptance of collateral in full or partial satisfaction of the obligation it secures: (1) discharges the obligation to the extent consented to by the debtor; (2) transfers to the secured party all of a debtor's rights in the collateral; (3) discharges the security interest or agricultural lien that is the subject of the debtor's consent and any subordinate security interest or other subordinate lien; and (4) terminates any other subordinate interest. (b) A subordinate interest is discharged or terminated under subsection (a), even if the secured party fails to comply with this article. Section 9-623. (a) A debtor, any secondary obligor, or any other secured party or lienholder may redeem collateral. (b) To redeem collateral, a person shall tender: (1) fulfillment of all obligations secured by the collateral; and (2) the reasonable expenses and attorney's fees described in Section 9-615(a)(1). (c) A redemption may occur at any time before a secured party: (1) has collected collateral under Section 9-607; (2) has disposed of collateral or entered into a contract for its disposition under Section 9-610; or (3) has accepted collateral in full or partial satisfaction of the obligation it secures under Section 9-622. Section 9-624. (a) A debtor or secondary obligor may waive the right to notification of disposition of collateral under Section 9-611 only by an agreement to that effect entered into and authenticated after default. (b) A debtor may waive the right to require disposition of collateral under Section 9-620(e) only by an agreement to that effect entered into and authenticated after default. (c) Except in a consumer-goods transaction, a debtor or secondary obligor may waive the right to redeem collateral under Section 9-623 only by an agreement to that effect entered into and authenticated after default. Section 9-625. (a) If it is established that a secured party is not proceeding in accordance with this article, a court may order or restrain collection, enforcement, or disposition of collateral on appropriate terms and conditions. (b) Subject to subsections (c) and (d) a person is liable for damages in the amount of any loss caused by a failure to comply with this article. Loss caused by a failure to comply may include loss resulting from the debtor's inability to obtain, or increased costs of, alternative financing. (c) Except as otherwise provided in Section 9-628: (1) a person that, at the time of the failure, was a debtor, was an obligor, or held a security interest in or other lien on the collateral may recover damages under subsection (b) for its loss; and (2) if the collateral is consumer goods, a person that was a debtor or a secondary obligor at the time a secured party failed to comply with this part may recover for that failure in any event an amount not less than the credit service charge plus 10 percent of the principal amount of the obligation or the time-price differential plus 10 percent of the cash price. (d) A debtor whose deficiency is eliminated under Section 9-626 may recover damages for the loss of any surplus. However, a debtor or secondary obligor whose deficiency is eliminated or reduced under Section 9-626 may not otherwise recover under subsection (b) for noncompliance with the provisions of this part relating to collection, enforcement, disposition, or acceptance. (e) If a secured party fails to comply with a request regarding a list of collateral or a statement of account under Section 9-210, the secured party may claim a security interest only as shown in the list or statement included in the request as against a person that is reasonably misled by the failure. Section 9-626. (a) In an action arising from a transaction in which the amount of a deficiency or surplus is in issue, the following rules apply: (1) A secured party need not prove compliance with the provisions of this part relating to collection, enforcement, disposition, or acceptance unless the debtor or a secondary obligor places the secured party's compliance in issue. (2) If the secured party's compliance is placed in issue, the secured party has the burden of establishing that the collection, enforcement, disposition, or acceptance was conducted in accordance with this part. (3) Except as otherwise provided in Section 9-628, if a secured party fails to prove that the collection, enforcement, disposition, or acceptance was conducted in accordance with the provisions of this part relating to collection, enforcement, disposition, or acceptance, the liability of a debtor or a secondary obligor for a deficiency is limited to an amount by which the sum of the secured obligation, expenses, and attorney's fees exceeds the greater of: (A) the proceeds of the collection, enforcement, disposition, or acceptance; or (B) the amount of proceeds that would have been realized had the noncomplying secured party proceeded in accordance with the provisions of this part relating to collection, enforcement, disposition, or acceptance. (4) For purposes of paragraph (3)(B), the amount of proceeds that would have been realized is equal to the sum of the secured obligation, expenses, and attorney's fees unless the secured party proves that the amount is less than that sum. (5) If a deficiency or surplus is calculated under Section 9-615(f), the debtor or obligor has the burden of establishing that the amount of proceeds of the disposition is significantly below the range of prices that a complying disposition to a person other than the secured party, a person related to the secured party, or a secondary obligor would have brought. Section 9-627. (a) The fact that a greater amount could have been obtained by a collection, enforcement, disposition, or acceptance at a different time or in a different method from that selected by the secured party is not of itself sufficient to preclude the secured party from establishing that the collection, enforcement, disposition, or acceptance was made in a commercially reasonable manner. (b) A disposition of collateral is made in a commercially reasonable manner if the disposition is made: (1) in the usual manner on any recognized market; (2) at the price current in any recognized market at the time of the disposition; or (3) otherwise in conformity with reasonable commercial practices among dealers in the type of property that was the subject of the disposition. (c) A collection, enforcement, disposition, or acceptance is commercially reasonable if it has been approved: (1) in a judicial proceeding; (2) by a bona fide creditors' committee; (3) by a representative of creditors; or (4) by an assignee for the benefit of creditors. (d) Approval under subsection (c) need not be obtained, and lack of approval does not mean that the collection, enforcement, disposition, or acceptance is not commercially reasonable. Section 9-628. (a) Unless a secured party knows that a person is a debtor or obligor, knows the identity of the person, and knows how to communicate with the person: (1) the secured party is not liable to the person, or to a secured party or lienholder that has filed a financing statement against the person, for failure to comply with this article; and (2) the secured party's failure to comply with this article does not affect the liability of the person for a deficiency. (b) A secured party is not liable because of its status as secured party: (1) to a person that is a debtor or obligor, unless the secured party knows: (A) that the person is a debtor or obligor; (B) the identity of the person; and (C) how to communicate with the person; or (2) to a secured party or lienholder that has filed a financing statement against a person, unless the secured party knows: (A) that the person is a debtor; and (B) the identity of the person. (c) A secured party is not liable to any person, and a person's liability for a deficiency is not affected, because of any act or omission arising out of the secured party's reasonable belief that a transaction is not a consumer-goods transaction or a consumer transaction or that goods are not consumer goods, if the secured party's belief is based on its reasonable reliance on: (1) a debtor's representation concerning the purpose for which collateral was to be used, acquired, or held; or (2) an obligor's representation concerning the purpose for which a secured obligation was incurred. (d) A secured party is not liable to any person under Section 9-625(c)(2) for its failure to comply with Section 9-616. (e) A secured party is not liable under Section 9-625(c)(2) more than once with respect to any one secured obligation. Section 9-701. This Act is effective on July 1, 2001, and on July 1, 2001, chapter 57A-9 is repealed. Section 9-702. (a) Except as otherwise provided in this part, this Act applies to a transaction or lien within its scope, even if the transaction or lien was entered into or created before this Act takes effect. (b) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c) and Sections 9-703 through 9-709: (1) transactions and liens that were not governed by former Article 9, were validly entered into or created before this Act takes effect, and would be subject to this Act if they had been entered into or created after this Act takes effect, and the rights, duties, and interests flowing from those transactions and liens remain valid after this Act takes effect; and (2) the transactions and liens may be terminated, completed, consummated, and enforced as required or permitted by this Act or by the law that otherwise would apply if this Act had not taken effect. (c) This Act does not affect an action, case, or proceeding commenced before this Act takes effect. Section 9-703. (a) A security interest that is enforceable immediately before this Act takes effect and would have priority over the rights of a person that becomes a lien creditor at that time is a perfected security interest under this Act if, when this Act takes effect, the applicable requirements for enforceability and perfection under this Act are satisfied without further action. (b) Except as otherwise provided in Section 9-705, if, immediately before this Act takes effect, a security interest is enforceable and would have priority over the rights of a person that becomes a lien creditor at that time, but the applicable requirements for enforceability or perfection under this Act are not satisfied when this Act takes effect, the security interest: (1) is a perfected security interest for one year after this Act takes effect; (2) remains enforceable thereafter only if the security interest becomes enforceable under Section 9-203 before the year expires; and (3) remains perfected thereafter only if the applicable requirements for perfection under this Act are satisfied before the year expires. Section 9-704. A security interest that is enforceable immediately before this Act takes effect but which would be subordinate to the rights of a person that becomes a lien creditor at that time: (1) remains an enforceable security interest for one year after this Act takes effect; (2) remains enforceable thereafter if the security interest becomes enforceable under Section 9-203 when this Act takes effect or within one year thereafter; and (3) becomes perfected: (A) without further action, when this Act takes effect if the applicable requirements for perfection under this Act are satisfied before or at that time; or (B) when the applicable requirements for perfection are satisfied if the requirements are satisfied after that time. Section 9-705. (a) If action, other than the filing of a financing statement, is taken before this Act takes effect and the action would have resulted in priority of a security interest over the rights of a person that becomes a lien creditor had the security interest become enforceable before this Act takes effect, the action is effective to perfect a security interest that attaches under this Act within one year after this Act takes effect. An attached security interest becomes unperfected one year after this Act takes effect unless the security interest becomes a perfected security interest under this Act before the expiration of that period. (b) The filing of a financing statement before this Act takes effect is effective to perfect a security interest to the extent the filing would satisfy the applicable requirements for perfection under this Act. (c) This Act does not render ineffective an effective financing statement that, before this Act takes effect, is filed and satisfies the applicable requirements for perfection under the law of the jurisdiction governing perfection as provided in former Section 9-103. However, except as otherwise provided in subsections (d) and (e) and Section 9-706, the financing statement ceases to be effective at the earlier of: (1) the time the financing statement would have ceased to be effective under the law of the jurisdiction in which it is filed; or (2) June 30, 2006. (d) The filing of a continuation statement after this Act takes effect does not continue the effectiveness of the financing statement filed before this Act takes effect. However, upon the timely filing of a continuation statement after this Act takes effect and in accordance with the law of the jurisdiction governing perfection as provided in Part 3, the effectiveness of a financing statement filed in the same office in that jurisdiction before this Act takes effect continues for the period provided by the law of that jurisdiction. (e) Subsection (c)(2) applies to a financing statement that, before this Act takes effect, is filed against a transmitting utility and satisfies the applicable requirements for perfection under the law of the jurisdiction governing perfection as provided in former Section 9-103 only to the extent that Part 3 provides that the law of a jurisdiction other than the jurisdiction in which the financing statement is filed governs perfection of a security interest in collateral covered by the financing statement. (f) A financing statement that includes a financing statement filed before this Act takes effect and a continuation statement filed after this Act takes effect is effective only to the extent that it satisfies the requirements of Part 5 for an initial financing statement. Section 9-706. (a) The filing of an initial financing statement in the office specified in Section 9-501 continues the effectiveness of a financing statement filed before this Act takes effect if: (1) the filing of an initial financing statement in that office would be effective to perfect a security interest under this Act; (2) the pre-effective-date financing statement was filed in an office in another State or another office in this State; and (3) the initial financing statement satisfies subsection (c). (b) The filing of an initial financing statement under subsection (a) continues the effectiveness of the pre-effective-date financing statement: (1) if the initial financing statement is filed before this Act takes effect, for the period provided in \u00a7 57A-9-403 with respect to a financing statement; and (2) if the initial financing statement is filed after this Act takes effect, for the period provided in Section 9-515 with respect to an initial financing statement. (c) To be effective for purposes of subsection (a), an initial financing statement must: (1) satisfy the requirements of Part 5 for an initial financing statement; (2) identify the pre-effective-date financing statement by indicating the office in which the financing statement was filed and providing the dates of filing and file numbers, if any, of the financing statement and of the most recent continuation statement filed with respect to the financing statement; and (3) indicate that the pre-effective-date financing statement remains effective. Section 9-707. (a) In this section, \"pre-effective-date financing statement\" means a financing statement filed before this Act takes effect. (b) After this Act takes effect, a person may add or delete collateral covered by, continue or terminate the effectiveness of, or otherwise amend the information provided in, a pre-effective- date financing statement only in accordance with the law of the jurisdiction governing perfection as provided in Part 3. However, the effectiveness of a pre-effective-date financing statement also may be terminated in accordance with the law of the jurisdiction in which the financing statement is filed. (c) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (d), if the law of this State governs perfection of a security interest, the information in a pre-effective-date financing statement may be amended after this Act takes effect only if: (1) the pre-effective-date financing statement and an amendment are filed in the office specified in Section 9-501; (2) an amendment is filed in the office specified in Section 9-501 concurrently with, or after the filing in that office of, an initial financing statement that satisfies Section 9- 706(c); or (3) an initial financing statement that provides the information as amended and satisfies Section 9-706(c) is filed in the office specified in Section 9-501. (d) If the law of this State governs perfection of a security interest, the effectiveness of a pre- effective-date financing statement may be continued only under Section 9-705(d) and (f) or 9- 706. (e) Whether or not the law of this State governs perfection of a security interest, the effectiveness of a pre-effective-date financing statement filed in this State may be terminated after this Act takes effect by filing a termination statement in the office in which the pre-effective-date financing statement is filed, unless an initial financing statement that satisfies Section 9-706(c) has been filed in the office specified by the law of the jurisdiction governing perfection as provided in Part 3 as the office in which to file a financing statement. Section 9-708. A person may file an initial financing statement or a continuation statement under this part if: (1) the secured party of record authorizes the filing; and (2) the filing is necessary under this part: (A) to continue the effectiveness of a financing statement filed before this Act takes effect; or (B) to perfect or continue the perfection of a security interest. Section 9-709. (a) This Act determines the priority of conflicting claims to collateral. However, if the relative priorities of the claims were established before this Act takes effect, former chapter 57A-9 determines priority. (b) For purposes of Section 9-322(a), the priority of a security interest that becomes enforceable under Section 9-203 of this Act dates from the time this Act takes effect if the security interest is perfected under this Act by the filing of a financing statement before this Act takes effect which would not have been effective to perfect the security interest under former chapter 57A-9. This subsection does not apply to conflicting security interests each of which is perfected by the filing of such a financing statement. Section 1.

The retention or reservation of title by a seller of goods notwithstanding shipment or delivery to the buyer ( \u00a7 57A-2-401) is limited in effect to a reservation of a \"security interest.\" The term also includes any interest of a consignor and a buyer of accounts or , chattel paper which , a payment intangible, or a promissory note in a transaction that is subject to chapter 57A-9. The special property interest of a buyer of goods on identification of those goods to a contract for sale under \u00a7 57A-2-401 is not a \"security interest,\" but a buyer may also acquire a \"security interest\" by complying with chapter 57A-9. Unless a consignment is intended as security, reservation of title thereunder is not a \"security interest\" but a consignment in any event is subject to the provisions on consignment sales ( \u00a7 57A-2-326). Except as otherwise provided in Section 2-505, the right of a seller or lessor of goods under Article 2 or 2A to retain or acquire possession of the goods is not a \"security interest,\" but a seller or lessor may also acquire a \"security interest\" by complying with Article 9. The retention or reservation of title by a seller of goods notwithstanding shipment or delivery to the buyer (Section 2-401) is limited in effect to a reservation of a \"security interest.\" Whether a transaction creates a lease or security interest is determined by the facts of each case; however, a transaction creates a security interest if the consideration the lessee is to pay the lessor for the right to possession and use of the goods is an obligation for the term of the lease not subject to termination by the lessee, and (a) the original term of the lease is equal to or greater than the remaining economic life of the goods, (b) the lessee is bound to renew the lease for the remaining economic life of the goods or is bound to become the owner of the goods, (c) the lessee has an option to renew the lease for the remaining economic life of the goods for no additional consideration or nominal additional consideration upon compliance with the lease agreement, or (d) the lessee has an option to become the owner of the goods for no additional consideration or nominal additional consideration upon compliance with the lease agreement. A transaction does not create a security interest merely because it provides that: (a) the present value of the consideration the lessee is obligated to pay the lessor for the right to possession and use of the goods is substantially equal to or is greater than the fair market value of the goods at the time the lease is entered into, (b) the lessee assumes risk of loss of the goods, or agrees to pay taxes, insurance, filing, recording, or registration fees, or service or maintenance costs with respect to the goods, (c) the lessee has an option to renew the lease or to become the owner of the goods, (d) the lessee has an option to renew the lease for a fixed rent that is equal to or greater than the reasonably predictable fair market rent for the use of the goods for the term of the renewal at the time the option is to be performed, or (e) the lessee has an option to become the owner of the goods for a fixed price that is equal to or greater than the reasonably predictable fair market value of the goods at the time the option is to be performed. For purposes of this subsection (37): (a) Additional consideration is not nominal if (i) when the option to renew the lease is granted to the lessee the rent is stated to be the fair market rent for the use of the goods for the term of the renewal determined at the time the option is to be performed, or (ii) when the option to become the owner of the goods is granted to the lessee the price is stated to be the fair market value of the goods determined at the time the option is to be performed. Additional consideration is nominal if it is less than the lessee's reasonably predictable cost of performing under the lease agreement if the option is not exercised; (b) \"Reasonably predictable\" and \"remaining economic life of the goods\" are to be determined with reference to the facts and circumstances at the time the transaction is entered into; and (c) \"Present value\" means the amount as of a date certain of one or more sums payable in the future, discounted to the date certain. The discount is determined by the interest rate specified by the parties if the rate is not manifestly unreasonable at the time the transaction is entered into; otherwise, the discount is determined by a commercially reasonable rate that takes into account the facts and circumstances of each case at the time the transaction was entered into. (38) \"Send\" in connection with any writing or notice means to deposit in the mail or deliver for transmission by any other usual means of communication with postage or cost of transmission provided for and properly addressed and in the case of an instrument to an address specified thereon or otherwise agreed, or if there be none to any address reasonable under the circumstances. The receipt of any writing or notice within the time at which it would have arrived if properly sent has the effect of a proper sending. (39) \"Signed\" includes any symbol executed or adopted by a party with present intention to authenticate a writing. (40) \"Surety\" includes guarantor. (41) \"Telegram\" includes a message transmitted by radio, teletype, cable, any mechanical method of transmission, or the like. (42) \"Term\" means that portion of an agreement which relates to a particular matter. (43) \"Unauthorized\" signature means one made without actual, implied, or apparent authority and includes a forgery. (44) \"Value.\" Except as otherwise provided with respect to negotiable instruments and bank collections ( \u00a7 \u00a7 57A-3-303, 57A-4-208, and 57A-4-209) a person gives \"value\" for rights if he acquires them (a) In return for a binding commitment to extend credit or for the extension of immediately available credit whether or not drawn upon and whether or not a charge-back is provided for in the event of difficulties in collection; or (b) As security for or in total or partial satisfaction of a preexisting claim; or (c) By accepting delivery pursuant to a preexisting contract for purchase; or (d) Generally, in return for any consideration sufficient to support a simple contract. (45) \"Warehouse receipt\" means a receipt issued by a person engaged in the business of storing goods for hire. (46) \"Written\" or \"writing\" includes printing, typewriting or any other intentional reduction to tangible form. Section 3. That \u00a7 57A-2-103 be amended to read as follows: 57A-2-103. (1) In this chapter unless the context otherwise requires (a) \"Buyer\" means a person who buys or contracts to buy goods. (b) \"Good faith\" in the case of a merchant means honesty in fact and the observance of reasonable commercial standards of fair dealing in the trade.

(4) In addition chapter 57A-1 contains general definitions and principles of construction and interpretation applicable throughout this chapter. Section 4. That \u00a7 57A-2-210 be amended to read as follows: 57A-2-210. (1) A party may perform his duty through a delegate unless otherwise agreed or unless the other party has a substantial interest in having his original promisor perform or control the acts required by the contract. No delegation of performance relieves the party delegating of any duty to perform or any liability for breach. (2) Unless Except as otherwise provided in Section 9-406, unless otherwise agreed , all rights of either seller or buyer can be assigned except where the assignment would materially change the duty of the other party, or increase materially the burden or risk imposed on him by his contract, or impair materially his chance of obtaining return performance. A right to damages for breach of the whole contract or a right arising out of the assignor's due performance of his entire obligation can be assigned despite agreement otherwise. (3) Unless the circumstances indicate the contrary a prohibition of assignment of \"the contract\" is to be construed as barring only the delegation to the assignee of the assignor's performance. The creation, attachment, perfection, or enforcement of a security interest in the seller's interest under a contract is not a transfer that materially changes the duty of or increases materially the burden or risk imposed on the buyer or impairs materially the buyer's chance of obtaining return performance within the purview of subsection (2) unless, and then only to the extent that, enforcement actually results in a delegation of material performance of the seller. Even in that event, the creation, attachment, perfection, and enforcement of the security interest remain effective, but (i) the seller is liable to the buyer for damages caused by the delegation to the extent that the damages could not reasonably be prevented by the buyer, and (ii) a court having jurisdiction may grant other appropriate relief, including cancellation of the contract for sale or an injunction against enforcement of the security interest or consummation of the enforcement. (4) An assignment of \"the contract\" or of \"all my rights under the contract\" or an assignment in similar general terms is an assignment of rights and unless the language or the circumstances (as in an assignment for security) indicate the contrary, it is a delegation of performance of the duties of the assignor and its acceptance by the assignee constitutes a promise by him to perform those duties. This promise is enforceable by either the assignor or the other party to the original contract. (5) The other party may treat any assignment which delegates performance as creating reasonable grounds for insecurity and may without prejudice to his rights against the assignor demand assurances from the assignee ( \u00a7 57A-2-609). Section 5. That \u00a7 57A-2-326 be amended to read as follows: 57A-2-326. (1) Unless otherwise agreed, if delivered goods may be returned by the buyer even though they conform to the contract, the transaction is (a) A \"sale on approval\" if the goods are delivered primarily for use; and (b) A \"sale or return\" if the goods are delivered primarily for resale. (2) Except as provided in subsection (3), goods Goods held on approval are not subject to the claims of the buyer's creditors until acceptance; goods held on sale or return are subject to such claims while in the buyer's possession. (3) Where goods are delivered to a person for sale and such person maintains a place of business at which he deals in goods of the kind involved, under a name other than the name of the person making delivery, then with respect to claims of creditors of the person conducting the business the goods are deemed to be on sale or return. The provisions of this section are applicable even though an agreement purports to reserve title to the person making delivery until payment or resale or uses such words as \"on consignment\" or \"on memorandum.\" However, this section is not applicable if the person making delivery: (a) Complies with an applicable law providing for a consignor's interest or the like to be evidenced by a sign; or (b) Establishes that the person conducting the business is generally known by his creditors to be substantially engaged in selling the goods of others; or (c) Complies with the filing provisions of the chapter on secured transactions (chapter 57A-9). (4) Any \"or return\" term of a contract for sale is to be treated as a separate contract for sale within the statute of frauds section of this chapter ( \u00a7 57A-2-201) and as contradicting the sale aspect of the contract within the provisions of this chapter on parol or extrinsic evidence ( \u00a7 57A-2-202). Section 6. That \u00a7 57A-2-502 be amended to read as follows: 57A-2-502. (1) Subject to subsection subsections (2) and (3) and even though the goods have not been shipped a buyer who has paid a part or all of the price of goods in which he has a special property under the provisions of \u00a7 57A-2-501 may on making and keeping good a tender of any unpaid portion of their price recover them from the seller if : (a) in the case of goods bought for personal, family, or household purposes, the seller repudiates or fails to deliver as required by the contract; or (b) in all cases, the seller becomes insolvent within ten days after receipt of the first installment on their price. (2) The buyer's right to recover the goods under subsection (1)(a) vests upon acquisition of a special property, even if the seller had not then repudiated or failed to deliver. (3) If the identification creating his special property has been made by the buyer he acquires the right to recover the goods only if they conform to the contract for sale. Section 7. That \u00a7 57A-2-716 be amended to read as follows: 57A-2-716. (1) Specific performance may be decreed where the goods are unique or in other proper circumstances. (2) The decree for specific performance may include such terms and conditions as to payment of the price, damages, or other relief as the court may deem just. (3) The buyer has a right of replevin for goods identified to the contract if after reasonable effort he is unable to effect cover for such goods or the circumstances reasonably indicate that such effort will be unavailing or if the goods have been shipped under reservation and satisfaction of the security interest in them has been made or tendered. In the case of goods bought for personal, family, or household purposes, the buyer's right of replevin vests upon acquisition of a special property, even if the seller had not then repudiated or failed to deliver. Section 8. That \u00a7 57A-2A-103 be amended to read as follows: 57A-2A-103. (1) In this chapter unless the context otherwise requires: (a) \"Buyer in ordinary course of business\" means a person who in good faith and without knowledge that the sale to him is in violation of the ownership rights or security interest or leasehold interest of a third party in the goods buys in ordinary course from a person in the business of selling goods of that kind but does not include a pawnbroker. \"Buying\" may be for cash or by exchange of other property or on secured or unsecured credit and includes receiving goods or documents of title under a preexisting contract for sale but does not include a transfer in bulk or as security for or in total or partial satisfaction of a money debt. (b) \"Cancellation\" occurs when either party puts an end to the lease contract for default by the other party. (c) \"Commercial unit\" means such a unit of goods as by commercial usage is a single whole for purposes of lease and division of which materially impairs its character or value on the market or in use.

(h) \"Goods\" means all things that are movable at the time of identification to the lease contract, or are fixtures ( \u00a7 57A-2A-309), but the term does not include money, documents, instruments, accounts, chattel paper, general intangibles, or minerals or the like, including oil and gas, before extraction. The term also includes the unborn young of animals. (i) \"Installment lease contract\" means a lease contract that authorizes or requires the delivery of goods in separate lots to be separately accepted, even though the lease contract contains a clause \"each delivery is a separate lease\" or its equivalent. (j) \"Lease\" means a transfer of the right to possession and use of goods for a term in return for consideration, but a sale, including a sale on approval or a sale or return, or retention or creation of a security interest is not a lease. Unless the context clearly indicates otherwise, the term includes a sublease. (k) \"Lease agreement\" means the bargain, with respect to the lease, of the lessor and the lessee in fact as found in their language or by implication from other circumstances including course of dealing or usage of trade or course of performance as provided in this chapter. Unless the context clearly indicates otherwise, the term includes a sublease agreement.

(4) In addition, chapter 57A-1 (commencing with \u00a7 57A-1-101) contains general definitions and principles of construction and interpretation applicable throughout this chapter. Section 9. That \u00a7 57A-2A-307 be amended to read as follows: 57A-2A-307. (1) Except as otherwise provided in \u00a7 57A-2A-306, a creditor of a lessee takes subject to the lease contract. (2) Except as otherwise provided in subsections subsection (3) and (4) of this section and in \u00a7 \u00a7 57A-2A-306 and 57A-2A-308, a creditor of a lessor takes subject to the lease contract ; (a) Unless unless the creditor holds a lien that attached to the goods before the lease contract became enforceable ; (b) Unless the creditor holds a security interest in the goods and the lessee did not give value and receive delivery of the goods without knowledge of the security interest; or (c) Unless the creditor holds a security interest in the goods that attached and was perfected before (i) the lease contract became enforceable, (ii) the lessee gave value and received delivery of the goods, or (iii) in the case of a purchase money security interest, the date that is twenty days after the date that the lessor received possession of the goods or the date that the lessee received possession of the goods, whichever is earlier. (3) A lessee in the ordinary course of business takes the leasehold interest free of a security interest in the goods created by the lessor even though the security interest is perfected and the lessee knows of its existence. (4) A lessee other than a lessee in the ordinary course of business takes the leasehold interest free of a security interest to the extent that it secures future advances made after the secured party acquires knowledge of the lease or more than forty-five days after the lease contract becomes enforceable, whichever first occurs, unless the future advances are made pursuant to a commitment entered into without knowledge of the lease and before the expiration of the forty-five-day period . (3) Except as otherwise provided in Sections 9-317, 9-321, and 9-323, a lessee takes a leasehold interest subject to a security interest held by a creditor of the lessor. Section 10. That \u00a7 57A-2A-309 be amended to read as follows: 57A-2A-309. (1) In this section: (a) Goods are \"fixtures\" when they become so related to particular real estate that an interest in them arises under real estate law; (b) A \"fixture filing\" is the filing, in the office where a mortgage on the real estate would be recorded, of a financing statement concerning goods that are or are to become fixtures and conforming to the requirements of \u00a7 57A-9-402(5) Section 9-502(a) and (b) ; (c) A lease is a \"purchase money lease\" unless the lessee has possession or use of the goods or the right to possession or use of the goods before the lease agreement is enforceable; (d) A mortgage is a \"construction mortgage\" to the extent it secures an obligation incurred for the construction of an improvement on land including the acquisition cost of the land, if the recorded writing so indicates; and (e) \"Encumbrance\" includes real estate mortgages and other liens on real estate and all other rights in real estate that are not ownership interests. (2) Under this chapter a lease may be of goods that are fixtures or may continue in goods that become fixtures, but no lease exists under this chapter of ordinary building materials incorporated into an improvement on land. (3) This chapter does not prevent creation of a lease of fixtures pursuant to real estate law. (4) The perfected interest of a lessor of fixtures has priority over a conflicting interest of an encumbrancer or owner of the real estate if: (a) The lease is a purchase money lease, the conflicting interest of the encumbrancer or owner arises before the goods become fixtures, a fixture filing covering the fixtures is filed before the goods become fixtures or within twenty days thereafter, and the lessee has an interest of record in the real estate or is in possession of the real estate; (b) A fixture filing covering the fixtures is filed before the interest of the encumbrancer or owner is of record, the lessor's interest has priority over any conflicting interest of a predecessor in title of the encumbrancer or owner, and the lessee has an interest of record in the real estate or is in possession of the real estate; (c) The fixtures are readily removable factory or office machines, readily removable equipment that is not primarily used or leased for use in the operation of the real estate, or readily removable replacements of domestic appliances that are goods subject to a consumer lease; (d) The conflicting interest is a lien on the real estate obtained by legal or equitable proceedings after the lease contract is enforceable; (e) The encumbrancer or owner has consented in writing to the lease or has disclaimed an interest in the goods as fixtures; or (f) The lessee has a right to remove the goods as against the encumbrancer or owner. If the lessee's right to remove terminates, the priority of the interest of the lessor continues for a reasonable time. (5) Notwithstanding subsection (a) of subsection (4) of this section but otherwise subject to subsection (4), the interest of a lessor of fixtures is subordinate to the conflicting interest of an encumbrancer of the real estate under a construction mortgage recorded before the goods become fixtures if the goods become fixtures before the completion of the construction. To the extent given to refinance a construction mortgage, the conflicting interest of an encumbrancer of the real estate under a mortgage has this priority to the same extent as the encumbrancer of the real estate under the construction mortgage. (6) In cases not within the preceding subsections, priority between the interest of a lessor of fixtures and the conflicting interest of an encumbrancer or owner of the real estate who is not the lessee is determined by the priority rules governing conflicting interests in real estate. (7) If the interest of a lessor has priority over all conflicting interests of all owners and encumbrancers of the real estate, the lessor or the lessee may (a) on default, expiration, termination, or cancellation of the lease agreement by the other party but subject to the provisions of the lease agreement and this chapter, or (b) if necessary to enforce his other rights and remedies under this chapter, remove the goods from the real estate, free and clear of all conflicting interests of all owners and encumbrancers of the real estate, but he must reimburse any encumbrancer or owner of the real estate who is not the lessee and who has not otherwise agreed for the cost of repair of any physical injury, but not for any diminution in value of the real estate caused by the absence of the goods removed or by any necessity of replacing them. A person entitled to reimbursement may refuse permission to remove until the party seeking removal gives adequate security for the performance of this obligation. Section 11. That \u00a7 57A-4-210 be amended to read as follows: 57A-4-210. (a) A collecting bank has a security interest in an item and any accompanying documents or the proceeds of either: (1) In case of an item deposited in an account, to the extent to which credit given for the item has been withdrawn or applied; (2) In case of an item for which it has given credit available for withdrawal as of right, to the extent of the credit given, whether or not the credit is drawn upon or there is a right of charge-back; or (3) If it makes an advance on or against the item. (b) If credit given for several items received at one time or pursuant to a single agreement is withdrawn or applied in part, the security interest remains upon all the items, any accompanying documents or the proceeds of either. For the purpose of this section, credits first given are first withdrawn. (c) Receipt by a collecting bank of a final settlement for an item is a realization on its security interest in the item, accompanying documents, and proceeds. So long as the bank does not receive final settlement for the item or give up possession of the item or accompanying documents for purposes other than collection, the security interest continues to that extent and is subject to chapter 57A-9, but: (1) No security agreement is necessary to make the security interest enforceable ( \u00a7 57A-9-203(1)(a)) (Section 9-203(b)(3)(A)) ; (2) No filing is required to perfect the security interest; and (3) The security interest has priority over conflicting perfected security interests in the item, accompanying documents, or proceeds. Section 12. That chapter 57A-5 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Section 5-118. (a) An issuer or nominated person has a security interest in a document presented under a letter of credit to the extent that the issuer or nominated person honors or gives value for the presentation. (b) So long as and to the extent that an issuer or nominated person has not been reimbursed or has not otherwise recovered the value given with respect to a security interest in a document under subsection (a), the security interest continues and is subject to Article 9, but: (1) a security agreement is not necessary to make the security interest enforceable under Section 9-203(b)(3); (2) if the document is presented in a medium other than a written or other tangible medium, the security interest is perfected; and (3) if the document is presented in a written or other tangible medium and is not a certificated security, chattel paper, a document of title, an instrument, or a letter of credit, the security interest is perfected and has priority over a conflicting security interest in the document so long as the debtor does not have possession of the document. Section 13. That \u00a7 57A-7-503 be amended to read as follows: 57A-7-503. (1) A document of title confers no right in goods against a person who before issuance of the document had a legal interest or a perfected security interest in them and who neither: (a) Delivered or entrusted them or any document of title covering them to the bailor or his nominee with actual or apparent authority to ship, store or sell or with power to obtain delivery under this chapter ( \u00a7 57A-7-403) or with power of disposition under this title ( \u00a7 57A-2-403 and 57A-9-307 Section 9-320 ) or other statute or rule of law; nor (b) Acquiesced in the procurement by the bailor or his nominee of any document of title. (2) Title to goods based upon an unaccepted delivery order is subject to the rights of anyone to whom a negotiable warehouse receipt or bill of lading covering the goods has been duly negotiated. Such a title may be defeated under \u00a7 57A-7-504 to the same extent as the rights of the issuer or a transferee from the issuer. (3) Title to goods based upon a bill of lading issued to a freight forwarder is subject to the rights of anyone to whom a bill issued by the freight forwarder is duly negotiated; but delivery by the carrier in accordance with part 4 of this chapter pursuant to its own bill of lading discharges the carrier's obligation to deliver. Section 14. That \u00a7 57A-8-103 be amended to read as follows: 57A-8-103. In this chapter: (a) A share or similar equity interest issued by a corporation, business trust, joint stock company, or similar entity is a security. (b) An \"investment company security\" is a security. \"Investment company security\" means a share or similar equity interest issued by an entity that is registered as an investment company under the federal investment company laws, an interest in a unit investment trust that is so registered, or a face-amount certificate issued by a face-amount certificate company that is so registered. Investment company security does not include an insurance policy or endowment policy or annuity contract issued by an insurance company. (c) An interest in a partnership or limited liability company is not a security unless it is dealt in or traded on securities exchanges or in securities markets, its terms expressly provide that it is a security governed by this chapter, or it is an investment company security. However, an interest in a partnership or limited liability company is a financial asset if it is held in a securities account. (d) A writing that is a security certificate is governed by this chapter and not by chapter 57A-3, even though it also meets the requirements of that chapter. However, a negotiable instrument governed by chapter 57A-3 is a financial asset if it is held in a securities account. (e) An option or similar obligation issued by a clearing corporation to its participants is not a security, but is a financial asset. (f) A commodity contract, as defined in \u00a7 57A-9-115 Section 9-102(a)(15) , is not a security or a financial asset. Section 15. That \u00a7 57A-8-106 be amended to read as follows: 57A-8-106. (a) A purchaser has \"control\" of a certificated security in bearer form if the certificated security is delivered to the purchaser. (b) A purchaser has \"control\" of a certificated security in registered form if the certificated security is delivered to the purchaser, and: (1) the certificate is indorsed to the purchaser or in blank by an effective indorsement; or (2) the certificate is registered in the name of the purchaser, upon original issue or registration of transfer by the issuer. (c) A purchaser has \"control\" of an uncertificated security if: (1) the uncertificated security is delivered to the purchaser; or (2) the issuer has agreed that it will comply with instructions originated by the purchaser without further consent by the registered owner. (d) A purchaser has \"control\" of a security entitlement if: (1) the purchaser becomes the entitlement holder; or (2) the securities intermediary has agreed that it will comply with entitlement orders originated by the purchaser without further consent by the entitlement holder; or (3) another person has control of the security entitlement on behalf of the purchaser or, having previously acquired control of the security entitlement, acknowledges that it has control on behalf of the purchaser. (e) If an interest in a security entitlement is granted by the entitlement holder to the entitlement holder's own securities intermediary, the securities intermediary has control. (f) A purchaser who has satisfied the requirements of subsection(c) (2) or (d) (2) has control , even if the registered owner in the case of subsection (c) (2) or the entitlement holder in the case of subsection (d) (2) retains the right to make substitutions for the uncertificated security or security entitlement, to originate instructions or entitlement orders to the issuer or securities intermediary, or otherwise to deal with the uncertificated security or security entitlement. (g) An issuer or a securities intermediary may not enter into an agreement of the kind described in subsection (c)(2) or (d)(2) without the consent of the registered owner or entitlement holder, but an issuer or a securities intermediary is not required to enter into such an agreement even though the registered owner or entitlement holder so directs. An issuer or securities intermediary that has entered into such an agreement is not required to confirm the existence of the agreement to another party unless requested to do so by the registered owner or entitlement holder. Section 16. That \u00a7 57A-8-110 be amended to read as follows: 57A-8-110. (a) The local law of the issuer's jurisdiction, as specified in subsection (d), governs: (1) the validity of a security; (2) the rights and duties of the issuer with respect to registration of transfer; (3) the effectiveness of registration of transfer by the issuer; (4) whether the issuer owes any duties to an adverse claimant to a security; and (5) whether an adverse claim can be asserted against a person to whom transfer of a certificated or uncertificated security is registered or a person who obtains control of an uncertificated security. (b) The local law of the securities intermediary's jurisdiction, as specified in subsection (e), governs: (1) acquisition of a security entitlement from the securities intermediary; (2) the rights and duties of the securities intermediary and entitlement holder arising out of a security entitlement; (3) whether the securities intermediary owes any duties to an adverse claimant to a security entitlement; and (4) whether an adverse claim can be asserted against a person who acquires a security entitlement from the securities intermediary or a person who purchases a security entitlement or interest therein from an entitlement holder. (c) The local law of the jurisdiction in which a security certificate is located at the time of delivery governs whether an adverse claim can be asserted against a person to whom the security certificate is delivered. (d) \"Issuer's jurisdiction\" means the jurisdiction under which the issuer of the security is organized or, if permitted by the law of that jurisdiction, the law of another jurisdiction specified by the issuer. An issuer organized under the law of this State may specify the law of another jurisdiction as the law governing the matters specified in subsection (a)(2) through (5). (e) The following rules determine a \"securities intermediary's jurisdiction\" for purposes of this section: (1) If an agreement between the securities intermediary and its entitlement holder specifies that it is governed by the law of a particular jurisdiction governing the securities account expressly provides that a particular jurisdiction is the securities intermediary's jurisdiction for purposes of this part, this article, or this Act , that jurisdiction is the securities intermediary's jurisdiction. (2) If paragraph (1) does not apply and an agreement between the securities intermediary and its entitlement holder governing the securities account expressly provides that the agreement is governed by the law of a particular jurisdiction, that jurisdiction is the securities intermediary's jurisdiction. (3) If neither paragraph (1) nor paragraph (2) applies and an agreement between the securities intermediary and its entitlement holder does not specify the governing law as provided in paragraph (1), but governing the securities account expressly specifies provides that the securities account is maintained at an office in a particular jurisdiction, that jurisdiction is the securities intermediary's jurisdiction. (3) (4) If an agreement between the securities intermediary and its entitlement holder does not specify a jurisdiction as provided in paragraph (1) or (2) none of the preceding paragraphs applies , the securities intermediary's jurisdiction is the jurisdiction in which is located the office identified in an account statement as the office serving the entitlement holder's account is located . (4) (5) If an agreement between the securities intermediary and its entitlement holder does not specify a jurisdiction as provided in paragraph (1) or (2) and an account statement does not identify an office serving the entitlement holder's account as provided in paragraph (3) none of the preceding paragraphs applies , the securities intermediary's jurisdiction is the jurisdiction in which is located the chief executive office of the securities intermediary is located . (f) A securities intermediary's jurisdiction is not determined by the physical location of certificates representing financial assets, or by the jurisdiction in which is organized the issuer of the financial asset with respect to which an entitlement holder has a security entitlement, or by the location of facilities for data processing or other record keeping concerning the account. Section 17. That \u00a7 57A-8-301 be amended to read as follows: 57A-8-301.

Section 18. That \u00a7 57A-8-302 be amended to read as follows: 57A-8-302. (a) Except as otherwise provided in subsections (b) and (c), upon delivery a purchaser of a certificated or uncertificated security to a purchaser, the purchaser acquires all rights in the security that the transferor had or had power to transfer. (b) A purchaser of a limited interest acquires rights only to the extent of the interest purchased. (c) A purchaser of a certificated security who as a previous holder had notice of an adverse claim does not improve its position by taking from a protected purchaser. Section 19.
