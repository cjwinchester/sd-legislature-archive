However, a school board may not approve a boundary change and a land exchange of the school district if the appraisal of the land to be detached has a fair market value that is ten percent more than the fair market value of the land that is proposed to be annexed to the school district. Fair market value is defined in \u00a7 10-6-1.3. Section 3. That \u00a7 13-6-84.1 be amended to read: 13-6-84.1. In all each proposed changes change in a school district boundaries, the following conditions shall prevail: (1) The district's boundary or land exchange, the boundary of the area proposed to be transferred shall be coterminous at some point detached, annexed, or exchanged must have a common boundary with the common boundary of the two involved school districts.

The school boards of the affected districts shall act upon the resolution of intent during their next meeting. Within thirty days of the passage of the resolution of intent by each district a public hearing shall be held by the boards of each district. Within thirty days of the public hearing, and if no petition for election has been filed pursuant to \u00a7 13-6-84.3, the school boards of each district shall meet and take final action on the resolution of intent.

The exchange of land between each school district may only be made if each school board is willing to exchange the land. If a school district is willing to detach, annex, or exchange land, the involved school district shall adopt a resolution of intent to exchange land with the other school district. The resolution of intent shall contain the following: (1) The name of each school district involved and a legal description of the land in each school district proposed to be exchanged through the detachment and annexation of land by each school district; (2) A map of the area proposed to be detached and annexed by each involved school district; (3) A statement certified by the county auditor setting forth the amount of the assessed valuation of the area to be detached and annexed, the total assessed valuation of the school district from which the area is proposed to be detached and the school district to which the area is proposed to be annexed, and the amount of any bonded indebtedness or judgments against each school district; and (4) A statement that the school district will request an appraisal to be completed by a certified appraiser that shows the fair market value of the land proposed to be detached and annexed by each of the involved school districts.

The school board of each involved school district shall acknowledge receipt of the resolution of intent at its next school board meeting, and representatives from both of the involved school districts shall meet and mutually agree on a certified appraiser to complete the appraisal. A school board may object to the appraisal within forty-five days of acknowledging the receipt of the appraisal.

Following the public hearing, the school board of each involved school district shall either approve or reject the land exchange.
