BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 23A-27-19 be amended to read: 23A-27-19. The sentencing court retains jurisdiction for the purpose of suspending any such sentence for a period of two years from the effective date of the judgment of conviction, notwithstanding the fact that the time for an appeal from such judgment is limited to a shorter period of time. The court shall notify the attorney who prosecuted such the person or shall notify the successor in office of such the prosecuting attorney at least fourteen days in advance of such the suspension. Such notice Notice shall be provided to any victim by such the prosecuting attorney or the successor in office pursuant to the provisions of \u00a7 23A-27-1.2. Any person whose sentence is suspended pursuant to this section is under the supervision of the Board of Pardons and Paroles, except as provided in \u00a7 23A-27-18.2. The board is charged with the responsibility for enforcing the conditions imposed by the sentencing judge, and the board retains jurisdiction to revoke the suspended portion of the sentence for violation of the terms of parole or the terms of the suspension. Section 2. That chapter 23A-27 be amended by adding a NEW SECTION to read: In addition to any conditions imposed by the sentencing judge, an inmate under the supervision of the Department of Corrections and the Board of Pardons and Paroles pursuant to \u00a7 23A-27-18.4 or 23A-27-19 shall maintain a good disciplinary record and comply with all programming required by the Department of Corrections and the Board of Pardons and Paroles. A suspended sentence may be revoked by the Board of Pardons and Paroles for failure to comply with these requirements. Section 3. That chapter 23A-27 be amended by adding a NEW SECTION to read: If an inmate is under the supervision of the Department of Corrections and the Board of Pardons and Paroles as directed in \u00a7\u00a7 23A-27-18.4 and 23A-27-19, the inmate is considered a parolee and is governed by the supervision and revocation provisions of chapters 24-15 and 24-15A. Section 4. That \u00a7 22-6-11 be amended to read: 22-6-11. The sentencing court shall sentence an offender convicted of a Class 5 or Class 6 felony, except those convicted under \u00a7\u00a7 22-11A-2.1, 22-18-1, 22-18-1.05, 22-18-26, 22-19A-1, 22-19A-2, 22-19A-3, 22-19A-7, 22-19A-16, 22-22A-2, 22-22A-4, 22-24A-3, 22-22-24.3, 22-24-1.2, 22-24B-2, 22-24B-12, 22-24B-12.1, 22-24B-23, 22-42-7, subdivision 24-2-14(1), 32-34-5, and any person ineligible for probation under \u00a7 23A-27-12, to a term of probation. If the offender is under the supervision of the Department of Corrections, the court shall order a fully suspended penitentiary sentence pursuant to \u00a7 23A-27-18.4. The sentencing court may impose a sentence other than probation or a fully suspended penitentiary sentence if the court finds aggravating circumstances exist that pose a significant risk to the public and require a departure from presumptive probation under this section. If a departure is made, the judge shall state on the record at the time of sentencing the aggravating circumstances and the same shall be stated in the dispositional order. Neither this section nor its application may be the basis for establishing a constitutionally protected liberty, property, or due process interest."}, {"bill_id": 7212, "bill_version_id": 40450,
