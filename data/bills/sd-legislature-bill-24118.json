Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of South Dakota: Section 1. The Legislature finds that the Secretary of State has various administrative functions that are necessary to ensure a fair and orderly petition and election process. These functions include but are not limited to sampling signatures to ensure their validity; certifying measures for the ballot; and preparing, printing, and distributing ballots. The Legislature finds that in addition to these administrative functions, it is also essential to provide sufficient time for the resolution of any legal challenges related to the petition circulation process. Such challenges may involve allegations of fraud, forgery, filing of false instruments, or other illegalities, and may be subject to review by both the Circuit Court and the Supreme Court. The Legislature finds that such litigation can be time-consuming and complex, and therefore, it is necessary to allow adequate time for it to be conducted in a thorough and fair manner. Accordingly, the Legislature finds that it is important to establish a clear timeline for the election process and deadline for petition submission that allows for both the Secretary of State's administrative functions and the resolution of any legal challenges. To this end, the Legislature determines that the following time windows are necessary: The Legislature finds that general election day in South Dakota is the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. Therefore, general election day occurs within November 2 to November 8. The Legislature finds that the absentee voting period begins 46 days prior to the general election. Therefore, absentee voting begins within September 17 to September 23. The Legislature finds that the South Dakota Secretary of State requires approximately one month to prepare and print all ballots to be used on general election day. Therefore, the time period for preparing and printing ballots must begin within August 18 to August 24. The Legislature finds that 60 days time is minimally sufficient to accommodate an appeal in the Supreme Court. Therefore, the time window for an appeal in the Supreme Court must begin within June 19 to June 25. The Legislature finds that 60 days time is minimally sufficient to accommodate an action in circuit court to challenge the validity of petition signatures. Therefore, the time window for a circuit court challenge must begin within April 20 to April 26. The Legislature finds that the South Dakota Secretary of State requires approximately 45 days to review petition signatures for validity and certify a measure for the ballot. Therefore, the time window for a circuit court challenge must begin within March 6 to March 12. Therefore, the Legislature finds that the petition submission deadline shall be the second Tuesday in March. Section 2. That \u00a7 2-1-1.1 be AMENDED: 2-1-1.1.
