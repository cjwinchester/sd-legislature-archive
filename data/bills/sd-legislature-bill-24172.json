WHEREAS, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, one in eight couples have trouble getting pregnant or sustaining a pregnancy. The World Health Organization and American Medical Association define infertility as a disease. Infertility affects women and men equally and does not discriminate based on race, religion, sexual orientation, marital status, or socioeconomic level; and WHEREAS, all family types face challenges when building their families. All people challenged in their family building journey should have access to all family building options. Family building options include adoption and medical treatment, such as in vitro fertilization and third-party reproduction. Cost and lack of insurance coverage are barriers for many to access the family building option they need; and WHEREAS, raising awareness of infertility and the barriers faced by the family building community is the first step to removing these barriers. The South Dakota Legislature joins RESOLVE: The National Infertility Association, families from South Dakota Surrogacy, Inc., and other dedicated volunteers, health care professionals, and members of the infertility and family building community by raising awareness of infertility and family building: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT COMMEMORATED, by the Ninety-Eighth Legislature of the State of South Dakota, that January 24, 2023, is South Dakota Infertility Awareness Day, and the commitment of families from South Dakota Surrogacy, Inc. is recognized for building a bridge between constituents suffering from infertility and members of the Legislature."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 24172, "action_date": "2023-01-24T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 245502, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/245502.pdf", "status_text": "Disapproved pursuant to JR 6H-4", "journal_page": 98, "committee_id_action": 1159, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}]}
