This notice is not required if the parent can prove a credible threat to the child's or parent's safety would ensue if notice is given.

The notice required in section 1 of this Act shall contain the following: (1) The address and telephone number, if known, of the new residence; (2) The purpose for relocating; (3) Why the relocation is in the best interest of the child; and (4) The relocating party's proposed visitation plan for the nonrelocating parent upon relocation. Section 3. If a parent's change in residence will significantly affect the child's contact with the other parent, notice must be served personally or given by certified mail. Section 4. At the request of the nonrelocating parent, made within thirty days of the notice of relocation, the court shall hold a hearing on the relocation. If no request for hearing is made within thirty days of notice, the relocation is presumed to be consented to by the nonrelocating parent. Section 5. At the hearing, the relocating party bears the initial burden to demonstrate, by a preponderance of evidence, that: (1) The relocation is for a legitimate purpose; (2) The proposed relocation is reasonable in light of the purpose; and (3) The relocation is in the best interest of the child.
