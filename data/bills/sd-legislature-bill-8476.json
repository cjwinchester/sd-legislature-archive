Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the death penalty may not be imposed upon any person who was mentally retarded intellectually disabled at the time of the commission of the offense and whose mental retardation intellectual disability was manifested and documented before the age of eighteen years. Section 2. That \u00a7 23A-27A-26.2 be amended to read: 23A-27A-26.2. As used in \u00a7\u00a7 23A-27A-26.1 to 23A-27A-26.7, inclusive, mental retardation intellectual disability means significant subaverage general intellectual functioning existing concurrently with substantial related deficits in applicable adaptive skill areas.

Section 3. That \u00a7 23A-27A-26.3 be amended to read: 23A-27A-26.3. Not later than ninety days prior to before the commencement of trial, the defendant may upon a motion alleging reasonable cause to believe the defendant was mentally retarded intellectually disabled at the time of the commission of the offense, apply for an order directing that a mental retardation an intellectual disability hearing be conducted prior to before trial. If, upon review of the defendant's motion and any response thereto to the defendant's motion, the court finds reasonable cause to believe the defendant was mentally retarded, it intellectually disabled, the court shall promptly conduct a hearing without a jury to determine whether the defendant was mentally retarded intellectually disabled.

Nothing in this paragraph precludes the defendant from presenting mitigating evidence of mental retardation an intellectual disability at the sentencing phase of the trial. If the court finds after the hearing that the defendant established mental retardation an intellectual disability by a preponderance of the evidence, the court shall prior to before commencement of trial, enter an order so stating the court's finding. Unless the order is reversed on appeal, a separate sentencing proceeding under this section may not be conducted if the defendant is thereafter convicted of murder in the first degree. If a separate sentencing proceeding is not conducted, the court, upon conviction of a defendant for the crime of murder in the first degree, shall sentence the defendant to life imprisonment without parole. Section 4. That \u00a7 23A-27A-26.4 be amended to read: 23A-27A-26.4. If the court enters an order pursuant to \u00a7 23A-27A-26.3 finding that the defendant was mentally retarded intellectually disabled at the time of the commission of the offense, the state may appeal as of right from the order. Upon entering such an order, the court shall afford the state a reasonable period of time, which may not be less than ten days, to determine whether to take an appeal from the order finding that the defendant was mentally retarded intellectually disabled.
