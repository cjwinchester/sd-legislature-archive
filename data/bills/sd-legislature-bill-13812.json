This includes the obligation to advertise the availability of local exchange services and prices to potential customers throughout the service area using media of general distribution. However, an applicant may petition the commission for a waiver from the requirement of satisfying the service obligations of an eligible telecommunications carrier. The commission may grant the waiver if, after notice and hearing pursuant chapter 1-26, it is established by a preponderance of the evidence that the waiver would not adversely impact universal service, that quality of service would be continued, and that it would otherwise be in the public interest. Section 11.

The company refusing access may not be compelled by the commission to build a facility outside its local exchange territory, or a centralized point serving several exchanges, to connect to the telecommunications company requesting the access. Nothing in \u00a7 49-31-15 may be construed to prevent telecommunications companies from providing access to each other's facilities by mutual consent. Section 21.

To that end, telecommunications companies may jointly provide facilities and enter into revenue- pooling arrangements between and among themselves relating to the provisioning of these facilities. Any such arrangement shall be subject to commission review and approval and, to the extent it has received such approval, may not be construed as violating any state or local laws governing unfair trade practices, antitrust or restraint of trade.

That chapter 49-31 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Pursuant to 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 251(f)(1) as of January 1, 1998, the obligations of an incumbent local exchange carrier, which include the duty to negotiate and provide interconnection, unbundled network elements, resale, notice of changes and collocation, do not apply to a rural telephone company unless the company has received a bona fide request for interconnection, services, or network elements and the commission determines that the rural telephone company shall fulfill the request. The commission may only determine that the rural telephone company shall fulfill the request if, after notice and hearing pursuant to chapter 1-26, the commission finds that the request is not unduly economically burdensome the request is technically feasible, and the request is consistent with the universal service principles and provisions set forth in 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254 as of January 1, 1998. The person or entity making the request shall have the burden of proof as to whether each of the standards for reviewing the request has been met. Nothing in this section prevents a rural telephone company from voluntarily agreeing to provide any of the services, facilities, or access referenced by this section. Section 18. That chapter 49-31 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Consistent with 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 251(f)(2) as of January 1, 1998, the commission may grant a suspension or modification of any of the interconnection or other requirements set forth in 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 \u00a7 251(b) and 251(c), as of January 1, 1998, to any local exchange carrier which serves fewer than two percent of the nation's subscriber lines installed in the aggregate nationwide. Any such carrier shall petition the commission for the suspension or modification. The commission shall grant the petition to the extent that, and for such duration as, the commission determines that the requested suspension or modification is consistent with the public interest, convenience, and necessity and is necessary: (1) To avoid a significant adverse economic impact on users of telecommunications services generally; (2) To avoid imposing a requirement that is unduly economically burdensome; or (3) To avoid imposing a requirement that is technically infeasible. The commission may suspend enforcement of the requirement or requirements identified in the petition pending final action on the requested suspension or modification. Section 19. That \u00a7 49-31-5.1 be amended to read as follows: 49-31-5.1. Telecommunications cooperatives organized pursuant to chapters 47-15 to 47-20, inclusive, municipal telephone systems operated pursuant to chapter 9-41, and independent telephone companies serving less than ten fifty thousand local exchange subscribers are not subject to chapter 49-11, \u00a7 \u00a7 49-31-1.1 to 49-31-1.4, inclusive, \u00a7 \u00a7 49-31-3.1 to 49-31-4.1, inclusive, \u00a7 \u00a7 49-31-4.3, 49-31-5 , and 49-31-6, \u00a7 \u00a7 49-31-12 to 49-31-12.5, inclusive, and \u00a7 \u00a7 49-31-44 to 49-31-46, inclusive. However, any cooperative, municipality or independent telecommunications company may elect to have its rates regulated by the commission and be subject to commission regulation for its emerging and noncompetitive telecommunications services. The election to be regulated shall be made by filing with the commission a certified copy of the resolution of the board of directors or the municipal governing body. Commission regulation shall become effective thirty days after receipt of the resolution by the commission. Section 20. That \u00a7 49-31-17 be repealed. 49-31-17. Notwithstanding \u00a7 49-31-15, no access may be compelled except at or within the local exchange boundary, or a centralized point serving several exchanges, of the telecommunications company refusing the access. The company refusing access may not be compelled by the commission to build a facility outside its local exchange territory, or a centralized point serving several exchanges, to connect to the telecommunications company requesting the access. Nothing in \u00a7 49-31-15 may be construed to prevent telecommunications companies from providing access to each other's facilities by mutual consent. Section 21. That \u00a7 49-31-20 be amended to read as follows: 49-31-20. No person who owns telecommunications facilities in this state may consolidate with or hold a controlling interest in the stock, bonds or assets of another telecommunications company owning a competing line, switch, exchange or other telecommunications facilities. A person may file with the commission an application to consolidate or merge telecommunications companies. If the commission finds after an investigation, notice and, with or without, public hearing that the public interest will be benefited by the consolidation or merger, the commission may issue a permit granting the consolidation or merger. Any telecommunications company that holds a certificate of authority to operate in this state shall notify the commission of any consolidation or merger with another telecommunications company. Section 22. That \u00a7 49-31-21 be repealed. 49-31-21. Any person before commencing the construction of a telecommunications facility, or an extension of an existing telecommunications facility outside its lawful local exchange territory, shall first apply to the commission for authority to do so. The application shall have attached thereto a plat or map showing the location of the proposed facility. Upon receipt of the application, the commission shall notify any other telecommunications company which may be affected and permit the filing of comments or objections. The commission may allow, with or without a hearing, the construction of a telecommunications facility if it finds the facility to be in the public interest and which will provide competition in the delivery or use of telecommunications services. If the proposed location of a facility is in the local exchange territory assigned to telephone cooperatives organized pursuant to chapters 47-15 to 47-20, inclusive, or municipal telephone systems operated pursuant to chapter 9-41, or independent telephone companies serving less than ten thousand local exchange subscribers, the commission may allow the proposed facility only upon the additional finding that the local exchange company operating the existing facility is not furnishing reasonably adequate telecommunications service and will not furnish reasonably adequate service within a reasonable time. Nothing in this section prohibits the construction of nonaccess facilities which cross the local exchange territory being lawfully occupied and served by another telecommunications company furnishing reasonably adequate service. Nothing in this section affects construction or extension of facilities within the local exchange territory for which a company has the certificate to operate, into contiguous territory which is not receiving similar service, or where a certificated telecommunications company agrees in writing to an attachment of lines or to the construction of telecommunications facilities in the affected company's local exchange territory. Section 23. That chapter 49-31 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: The commission may implement and comply with the provisions of the federal Telecommunications Act of 1996, including the promulgation of rules pursuant to chapter 1-26. Except to the extent a local exchange carrier is exempt from or has received a suspension or modification pursuant to 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 251(f)(1) or 251(f)(2), as of January 1, 1998, and the provisions of this chapter, the carrier shall provide interconnection, network elements, and other telecommunications services to any provider of competitive telecommunications services that requests such interconnection and services to the extent required by 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 \u00a7 251(a) to 251(c), inclusive, as of January 1, 1998. If the parties are unable to voluntarily negotiate an agreement for the interconnection or services requested, either party may petition the commission to mediate or arbitrate any unresolved issues as provided in 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 252. The provisioning of interconnection, network elements, and other telecommunications services to the extent required by 47 USC \u00a7 \u00a7 251(a) to 251(c), inclusive, by a local exchange carrier pursuant to this section is not subject to \u00a7 \u00a7 49-31-1.1 to 49-31-1.4, inclusive, \u00a7 \u00a7 49-31-3.1 to 49-31-4, inclusive, \u00a7 \u00a7 49-31-12.2, 49-31-12.4, 49-31-12.5, and \u00a7 \u00a7 49-31-18 and 49-31-19, inclusive. Section 24. That chapter 49-31 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: It is recognized that certain resale restrictions may be necessary to prevent unfair competition, preserve universal service and otherwise protect the public interest. The commission may permit reasonable and nondiscriminatory resale restrictions proposed by local exchange carriers that are consistent with 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 251(c)(4) and that do not constitute a barrier to entry under 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 253(a). The commission may adopt rules pursuant to chapter 1-26 to implement this section. Section 25. That chapter 49-31 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: The commission may not prohibit telecommunications companies from voluntarily forming an association to assist in the administration and filing of schedules or tariffs and to engage in the pooling of access costs and revenues in a manner which is consistent with preserving and advancing universal service throughout this state or consistent with the Public Communications Network Infrastructure policies set forth in \u00a7 \u00a7 49-31-60 to 49-31-68, inclusive. Section 26. That \u00a7 49-31-44 be amended to read as follows: 49-31-44. There is hereby created a fund within the state treasury to be known as the \" telecommunications investigation fund \" which shall be used by the commission to defray the expenses of conducting investigations or public hearings relating to \u00a7 \u00a7 49-31-3.2 to 49-31-3.4, inclusive, 49-31-4 , and 49-31-4.1 , or arbitration proceedings conducted pursuant to 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 252 as of January 1, 1998 . Each telecommunications company as defined in subdivision 49-31-1(9) , upon the opening of that is a party to an official docket to exercise commission authority pursuant to \u00a7 \u00a7 49-31-3.2 to 49-31-3.4, inclusive, 49-31-4 and 49-31-4.1, or arbitration proceedings conducted pursuant to 47 U.S.C \u00a7 252 as of January 1, 1998, shall make a deposit not to exceed seventy-five thousand dollars in the \" telecommunications investigation fund. \" The amount and the division of the deposit among the companies, if any, shall be designated by commission order. However, any costs incurred related to arbitration proceedings conducted pursuant to 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 252 as of January 1, 1998, shall be shared equally among the parties. The commission shall use the deposit to defray the expense incident to conducting the hearing or investigation of the company making the deposit. The deposit is appropriated to the use of the commission for such purpose. The funds necessary for such expenses are hereby authorized to be expended. Section 27. It is the intent of the Legislature to encourage telecommunications companies to more efficiently meet the infrastructure deployment goal described in \u00a7 \u00a7 49-31-60 to 49-31- 68, inclusive, for a fully integrated SONET backbone of interconnected survivable rings. To that end, telecommunications companies may jointly provide facilities and enter into revenue- pooling arrangements between and among themselves relating to the provisioning of these facilities. Any such arrangement shall be subject to commission review and approval and, to the extent it has received such approval, may not be construed as violating any state or local laws governing unfair trade practices, antitrust or restraint of trade. Further, it is the intent of the Legislature that any such approved arrangement shall be exempt from federal laws governing unfair trade practices, antitrust, or restraint of trade. Except with respect to such joint provisioning of facilities and revenue pooling arrangements approved by the commission, both state and federal laws governing unfair trade practices, antitrust, and restraint of trade shall apply with full force and effect. The joint provisioning of facilities within an arrangement consistent with the limited purpose described in this section may not be construed as imposing additional common carrier obligations on the participating companies. The provisions of this section may not be construed to permit any telecommunications company to take any action that is contrary to the public interest. Section 28. It is in the public interest and essential that local exchange telecommunication companies over all of South Dakota continue to be viable providers of affordable local exchange services. Local exchange telecommunication companies receive substantial revenue necessary to support the exchange from a minority of their customers. Local exchange telecommunication companies must be allowed to compete to keep their profitable customers in order to maintain the viability of local exchanges. However, customers in rural and high-cost areas shall have access to telecommunications and information services, including interexchange services, that are reasonably comparable to those services provided in urban areas and that are available at rates that are reasonably comparable to rates charged for similar services in urban areas. Notwithstanding any other provisions of chapter 49-31, any telecommunication company may grant any discounts, incentives, services, or other business practices necessary to meet competition. Nothing in chapter 49-31 restricts or prevents telecommunication companies from offering reduced prices and special terms and conditions for this state, its existing instrumentalities and subdivisions, for the United States and for K through 12 schools accredited by the secretary of the Department of Education and Cultural Affairs. Section 29. That chapter 49-31 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Any regulation of telecommunications service by the commission pursuant to chapters 49-13 and 49-31 shall be fair, reasonable, nondiscriminatory and applicable to all telecommunications carriers providing service in the state. The commission shall establish, by rules promulgated pursuant to chapter 1-26, quality of service standards. Section 30. That chapter 49-31 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Prices as of January 1, 1998, for residential and business local exchange service, both recurring and nonrecurring, for a telecommunications company with more than two hundred thousand retail access lines in the state may not be changed unless reduced by the company. If the telecommunications company reduces its prices for residential or business local exchange service pursuant to this Act, it shall not subsequently increase such prices. The provisions of \u00a7 49-31-4 and \u00a7 \u00a7 49-31-12 to 49-31-12.5, inclusive, do not apply to prices for services regulated by this section. Section 31. That chapter 49-31 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Dialing parity, as defined in 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 153 (15) as of January 1, 1998, for purposes of intraLATA long distance telecommunications services, may not be implemented by order of the commission until all providers of toll services are authorized to provide interLATA services which originate in this state. Section 32. Nothing in sections 28 to 31, inclusive, of this Act exempts any telecommunications company from any state or federal antitrust laws.
