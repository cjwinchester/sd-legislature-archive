WHEREAS, the 1985 Farm Bill with the Swampbuster Act Provision was national policy for all of the fifty states of the United States of North America; and WHEREAS, the South Dakota Natural Resources Conservation Service made its own separate set of rules regarding wetland determinations in 1985 because they said that South Dakota was unique in that the state was in the Prairie Pothole Region; and WHEREAS, the fact is that the Prairie Pothole Region of North America includes large portions of the four states of Iowa, Minnesota, North Dakota, and South Dakota, and these four states all have similar if not identical wetland characteristics; and WHEREAS, the South Dakota Natural Resources Conservation Service finally admitted that it was out of compliance with the 1985 Swampbuster Act and made procedural adjustments for making wetland determinations which were approved by the National Natural Resources Conservation Service in August of 1999; and WHEREAS, the National Natural Resources Conservation Service then made an out-of- court settlement agreement in January 2000 with the National Wildlife Federation and other groups which nullified the procedural adjustments adopted by the South Dakota Natural Resources Conservation Service in August 1999; and WHEREAS, the South Dakota Natural Resources Conservation Service and the South Dakota farm producers had no input into the provisions of the settlement agreement but the South Dakota farm producers are directly affected by the results, and they are unable to negotiate on their own behalf; and WHEREAS, South Dakota farm producers are good stewards of their land and water resources and understand the need to protect true wetlands and the need to protect wildlife: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the Senate of the Seventy-fifth Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the House of Representatives concurring therein, that the Legislature of the State of South Dakota: (1) Supports efforts by the South Dakota Natural Resources Conservation Service to follow national policy for making wetland determinations in compliance with the 1985 Farm Bill Swampbuster Act; (2) Supports efforts by South Dakota farm producers to be treated fairly and equitably by the Natural Resources Conservation Service, United States Fish and Wildlife Service, and other state and federal agencies on wetlands issues; and (3) Supports efforts by South Dakota farm producers to demonstrate sound soil and water management practices which reduce erosion, protect water quality, and provide friendly wildlife habitat."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 15788, "action_date": "2000-02-17T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 85955, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/85955.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 630, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 15788, "action_date": "2000-02-17T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 85955, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/85955.pdf", "status_text": "Tabled", "journal_page": 544, "committee_id_action": 630, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 44657, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [2310, 2311, 2346, 2347, 2386, 2398, 2400, 2329], "Nay": [2358]}}]}
