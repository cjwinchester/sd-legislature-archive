WHEREAS, in 2008 the United States Congress passed a mandatory country-of-origin labeling for muscle cuts of meat sold at retail, which required meat produced in the United States from imported livestock to bear a different label than meat produced from United States born livestock; and WHEREAS, in 2013 the United States Department of Agriculture issued new regulations that provided additional information to the consumer on where meat was born, raised, and harvested; and WHEREAS, trade groups and the organizations representing multinational meatpackers worked predominantly with Canada, as well as Mexico, to bring a World Trade Organization (WTO) case against the United States for the removal of the labeling requirements; and WHEREAS, in May 2015 the WTO issued a final ruling that the United States' country-of-origin labeling regime was out of compliance with WTO regulations because it required the segregation of imported animals; and WHEREAS, Canada and Mexico have asked the WTO for permission to retaliate against the United States for damages that have yet to be proven; and WHEREAS, Doctor Robert Taylor, of Auburn University, issued a study in February of 2015 demonstrating that Canadian and Mexican beef feeder and fat cattle markets were not affected by country-of-origin labeling and that feeder cattle and fat cattle imported from both Mexico and Canada were not affected by the country-of-origin labeling; and WHEREAS, consumers have repeatedly and overwhelmingly expressed their support for country of origin labeling of food products in the United States: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the House of Representatives of the Ninety-First Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the Senate concurring therein, that the Legislature will continue to support consumers' right to know where their food comes from and support the use of country-of-origin labels."}, {"bill_id": 7587, "bill_version_id": 40318, "bill_version": "Enrolled", "bill_version_date": "2016-03-03T10:14:27.427-06:00", "bill_text": ""}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 7587, "action_date": "2016-02-24T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 39955, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/39955.pdf", "status_text": "First Reading", "journal_page": 661, "committee_id_action": 325, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 7587, "action_date": "2016-02-25T12:30:00-06:00", "document_id": 39997, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/39997.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to another day", "journal_page": 698, "committee_id_action": 325, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 7587, "action_date": "2016-02-29T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 40105, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/40105.pdf", "status_text": "Adopt Resolution", "journal_page": 713, "committee_id_action": 325, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 21617, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [1043, 1042, 983, 1057, 964, 1040, 995, 1039, 1050, 1060, 985, 976, 1049, 1022, 1061, 1021, 1002, 1019, 1065, 972, 963, 1038, 982, 1055, 1044, 1058, 1036, 1048, 1024, 1018, 1027, 1028, 992, 991, 1052, 1030, 988, 993, 1026, 1023, 1069, 996, 990, 1032, 1051, 965, 1053, 1064, 989], "Nay": [1063, 986, 1009, 1033, 1056, 1062, 1017, 968, 1059, 1054, 1031, 1034, 1006, 1007, 981, 1029, 1025], "Excused": [980, 1015, 987, 1003]}}, {"bill_id": 7587, "action_date": "2016-03-01T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 40196, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/40196.pdf", "status_text": "First Reading", "journal_page": 488, "committee_id_action": 309, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 7587, "action_date": "2016-03-02T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 40280, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/40280.pdf", "status_text": "Concurred in Resolution", "journal_page": 502, "committee_id_action": 309, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 21730, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [974, 999, 1067, 979, 969, 1005, 1047, 1035, 984, 994, 1041, 967, 975, 1011, 1010, 1020, 1016, 1001, 1012, 1000], "Nay": [977, 1037, 966, 1014, 998, 997, 971, 1046, 1066, 1045, 970, 978, 1013, 973, 1008]}}]}
