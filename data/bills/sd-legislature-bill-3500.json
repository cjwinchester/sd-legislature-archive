(g) Commencing on July 1, 1994, every change of beneficiary form issued by an insurance company under any life or endowment insurance policy or annuity contract to an insured or owner who is a resident of this state must request the following information: (1) The name of each beneficiary, or if a class of beneficiaries is named, the name of each current beneficiary in the class; (2) The address of each beneficiary; and (3) The relationship of each beneficiary to the insured. Section 6. That \u00a7 43-41B-10 be amended to read as follows: 43-41B-10. (a) Except as provided in subsections (b) and (e), stock or other intangible ownership interest in a business association, the existence of which is evidenced by records available to the association, is presumed abandoned and, with respect to the interest, the association is the holder, if a dividend, distribution, or other sum payable as a result of the interest has remained unclaimed by the owner for five three years and the owner within five three years has not: (1) Communicated in writing with the association regarding the interest or a dividend, distribution, or other sum payable as a result of the interest; or (2) Otherwise communicated with the association regarding the interest or a dividend, distribution, or other sum payable as a result of the interest, as evidenced by a memorandum or other record on file with the association prepared by an employee of the association. (b) At the expiration of a five-year three-year period following the failure of the owner to claim a dividend, distribution, or other sum payable to the owner as a result of the interest, the interest is not presumed abandoned unless there have been at least five three dividends, distributions, or other sums paid during the period, none of which has been claimed by the owner. If five three dividends, distributions, or other sums are paid during the five-year three-year period, the period leading to a presumption of abandonment commences on the date payment of the first such unclaimed dividend, distribution, or other sum became due and payable. If five three dividends, distributions, or other sums are not paid during the presumptive period, the period continues to run until there have been five three dividends, distributions, or other sums that have not been claimed by the owner. (c) The running of the five-year three-year period of abandonment ceases immediately upon the occurrence of a communication referred to in subsection (a). If any future dividend, distribution, or other sum payable to the owner as a result of the interest is subsequently not claimed by the owner, a new period of abandonment commences and relates back to the time a subsequent dividend, distribution, or other sum became due and payable. (d) At the time an interest is presumed abandoned under this section, any dividend, distribution, or other sum then held for or owing to the owner as a result of the interest, and not previously presumed abandoned, is presumed abandoned. (e) This chapter does apply to any stock or other intangible ownership interest enrolled in a plan that provides for the automatic reinvestment of dividends, distributions, or other sums payable as a result of the interest if the records available to the administrator of the plan show, with respect to any intangible ownership interest not enrolled in the reinvestment plan, that the owner has not within five three years communicated in any manner described in subsection (a). Section 7. That \u00a7 43-41B-13 be amended to read as follows: 43-41B-13. (a) Intangible property and any income or increment derived therefrom held by fiduciaries and agents for the benefit of another person is presumed abandoned unless the owner, within five three years after it has become payable or distributable, has increased or decreased the principal, accepted payment of principal or income, communicated concerning the property, or otherwise indicated an interest as evidenced by a memorandum or other record on file prepared by the fiduciary. (b) Funds in an individual retirement account or a retirement plan for self-employed individuals or similar account or plan established pursuant to the Internal Revenue laws of the United States are not payable or distributable within the meaning of subsection (a) unless, under the terms of the account or plan, distribution of all or part of the funds would then be mandatory. (c) For the purpose of this section, a person who holds property as an agent for a business association is deemed to hold the property in a fiduciary capacity for that business association alone, unless the agreement between him and the business association provides otherwise. (d) For the purposes of this chapter, a person who is deemed to hold property in a fiduciary capacity for a business association alone is the holder of the property only insofar as the interest of the business association in the property is concerned, and the business association is the holder of the property insofar as the interest of any other person in the property is concerned. Section 8. That \u00a7 43-41B-15 be amended to read as follows: 43-41B-15. (a) A gift certificate or a credit memo issued in the ordinary course of an issuer's business which remains unclaimed by the owner for more than five three years after becoming payable or distributable is presumed abandoned. (b) In the case of a gift certificate, the amount presumed abandoned is the price paid by the purchaser for the gift certificate. In the case of a credit memo, the amount presumed abandoned is the amount credited to the recipient of the memo. Section 9. That \u00a7 43-41B-17 be amended to read as follows: 43-41B-17. Any tangible and intangible property held in a safe deposit box or any other safekeeping repository or agency or collateral deposit box in this state in the ordinary course of the holder's business and proceeds resulting from the sale of the property permitted by other law, which remain unclaimed by the owner for more than five three years after the lease or rental period on the box or other repository has expired, are presumed abandoned. Section 10. That \u00a7 43-41B-19 be amended to read as follows: 43-41B-19. (a) The administrator shall cause a notice to be published not later than March first of the year within the quarter immediately following the report required by \u00a7 43-41B-18 at least once a week for two consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the county of this state in which is located the last known address of any person to be named in the notice. If no address is listed or the address is outside this state, the notice must be published in the county in which the holder of the property has its principal place of business within this state. (b) The published notice must be entitled \"Notice of Names of Persons Appearing to be Owners of Abandoned Property\" and contain: (1) The names in alphabetical order and last known address, if any, of persons listed in the report and entitled to notice within the county as specified in subsection (a); (2) A statement that information concerning the property and the name and last known address of the holder may be obtained by any person possessing an interest in the property by addressing an inquiry to the administrator; and (3) A statement that if proof of claim is not presented by the owner and the owner's right to receive the property must be established to the administrator's satisfaction to whom all claims must be directed. (c) The administrator is not required to publish in the notice any items of less than fifty one hundred twenty-five dollars unless the administrator considers their publication to be in the public interest. (d) This section is not applicable to sums payable on travelers checks, money orders, and other written instruments presumed abandoned under \u00a7 43-41B-4."}, {"bill_id": 3500, "bill_version_id":
