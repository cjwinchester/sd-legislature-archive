The Marines had called their small base \"the Operation Chinook Perimeter,\" but after the battle of December twenty-second, they named the position \"Camp Evans\" out of respect for their friend Paul Evans, a six foot, six inch gentle giant who had the gift of being able to make everyone laugh during difficult situations and who was not afraid to risk everything for his fellow Marines; and WHEREAS, Camp Evans, located midway between Quang Tri City and Hue on Highway 1, was expanded a number of times and continued under Marine control until 1968 when it became the headquarters for the U.S. Army's 1st Cavalry Division for a time.
