BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That chapter 10-6 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Any nonagricultural property, as defined in \u00a7 10-6-31, which sells for more than one hundred fifty percent of its assessed value is hereby classified for purposes of ad valorem taxation as class one nonagricultural property. Section 2. That chapter 10-6 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Any property which is classified pursuant to section 1 of this Act shall remain so classified for a minimum of five years. However, if the market value of such property exceeds the assessed value established pursuant to sections 1 to 3, inclusive, of this Act the property shall be reclassified, assessed, and taxed based on its current use. Five years after the property is so classified, the property may be reclassified as nonagricultural property, if the owner of the property submits an application to the director of equalization requesting that the property be reclassified. The application shall identify which classification of property the owner is requesting and documentation, if requested by the director of equalization, supporting such request. Section 3. That chapter 10-6 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Property classified pursuant to sections 1 and 2 of this Act shall be valued for ad valorem tax purposes at the price for which such property sold multiplied times the level of assessment for nonagricultural property within the county. The value of such land shall be increased or decreased each year by the same percentage that the value of nonagricultural property increases or decreases. Section 4. That chapter 10-6 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Any owner-occupied single family dwelling, as defined in \u00a7 10-13-39, which sells for more than one hundred fifty percent of its assessed value is hereby classified for purposes of ad valorem taxation as class one owner-occupied single family dwelling.
