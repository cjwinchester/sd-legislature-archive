WHEREAS, civil aviation plays a pivotal role in promoting business, trade, tourism, and cultural exchange; and WHEREAS, the development of international civil aviation in a safe and orderly manner is the supreme cause of the ICAO; and WHEREAS, with an excellent geographic location, Taiwan is a key aviation hub for regions in northeastern and southeastern Asia; and WHEREAS, the Taipei Flight Information Region (FIR), bordering the FIRs of Fukuoka, Manila, Hong Kong and Shanghai, provides services for more than 1.3 million flights and 40 million passengers annually, making Taiwan a key aviation hub in East Asia; and WHEREAS, Taiwan is linked by air to one hundred seventeen cities across the globe through one hundred eighty-one passenger routes and eighty-six freight routes, with one hundred fifty scheduled flights to and from Europe, four hundred to and from the United States, six hundred to and from Japan, and more than one thousand two hundred across the Taiwan Strait every week; and WHEREAS, without Taiwan's participation, international flight plans, regulations, and procedure that the ICAO formulates will be incomplete and unsafe; and WHEREAS, Taiwan's request to participate in the ICAO is fully in line with the United States government's policy of supporting Taiwan's meaningful participation in United Nations specialized agencies; and WHEREAS, on December 7, 1984, the State of South Dakota and the Taiwan Province of the Republic of China (Taiwan) jointly established a sister state relationship to promote international understanding and goodwill and to strengthen a greater friendship between the residents of South Dakota and Taiwan; and WHEREAS, over the past thirty years, the bonds of the true friendship and steadfast trade partnership between South Dakota and Taiwan have strengthened, resulting in a better economic, social, and cultural exchange between the two; and WHEREAS, every other year, Taiwan has sent an agricultural trade goodwill mission to the U.S. Midwest region including the State of South Dakota to demonstrate Taiwan's continuing goodwill and willingness to purchase South Dakota agricultural products and the South Dakota agricultural industry has benefitted greatly over the past two decades from the sale of beef, wheat, and corn to Taiwan; and WHEREAS, the commercial interaction between the State of South Dakota and Taiwan has grown substantially with each passing year, resulting in increased economic growth for both Taiwan and South Dakota; and WHEREAS, the successful Trade & Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA) meeting held on March 10, 2013, is a welcome progress to the bilateral U.S.-Taiwan trade relations. Taiwan is a top United States trading partner, and the TIFA meeting is laying the groundwork for a possible Bilateral Investment Agreement (BIA). This is also essential to a more robust and ambitious trade relationship between the United States and Taiwan; and WHEREAS, for Taiwan, the resumption of TIFA talks with the United States is only the beginning of what must be a sustained push for further and more wide-ranging trade arrangements with its myriad trading partners. A chief target should be Taiwan's inclusion in the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) in the near future; and WHEREAS, Taiwan's inclusion in the TPP would contribute substantially to the depth, viability, and quality of the TPP, Taiwan's strong economic weight in the Asia-Pacific, its well-developed knowledge base and highly-skilled workforce, its vital position along regional supply chains and value chains, and the positive economic and strategic gains for all make Taiwan an ideal candidate economy for the TPP's expansion: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the House of Representatives of the Eighty-Ninth Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the Senate concurring therein, that the South Dakota Legislature endorses Taiwan's participation in the International Civil Aviation Organization (lCAO) as an observer; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the South Dakota Legislature is celebrating the thirtieth anniversary of sister state relations with the Province of Taiwan in the Republic of China (Taiwan); and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the South Dakota Legislature is supportive of all efforts to include Taiwan in the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP); and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that copies of this resolution be sent to the United States Secretary of State, the United States Secretary of Transportation, each member of the South Dakota Congressional Delegation and Director General Jack J.C.
