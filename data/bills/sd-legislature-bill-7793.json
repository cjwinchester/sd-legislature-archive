The powers referenced in subdivisions (5), (6), and (11) may be granted notwithstanding the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 55-3-24 to 55-3-28, inclusive. Section 30. That \u00a7 55-2-13 be amended to read: 55-2-13. Notification to any qualified beneficiary under this section may be carried out personally, by mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the entity or individual's last known post office address, or electronically pursuant to the provisions of \u00a7 15-6-5(d), and on representatives of qualified beneficiaries pursuant to sections 1 to 26, inclusive, of this Act. For purposes of this section, the term, qualified beneficiary, means a beneficiary that is an entity then in existence or an individual who is twenty-one years of age or older and who, on the date the beneficiary's qualification is determined: (1) Is a distributee or permissible distributee of trust income or principal; (2) Would be a distributee or permissible distributee of trust income or principal if the interests of the distributees terminated on that date; or (3) Would be a distributee or permissible distributee of trust income or principal if the trust terminated on that date. However, if the distributee is then unknown because a person holds a power to change the distributee, the trustee shall give notice only to the holder of the power. Except as otherwise provided by the terms of a revocable trust, a trustee has no duty to notify the qualified beneficiaries of the trust's existence. Except as otherwise provided by the terms of an irrevocable trust or otherwise directed in writing by the settlor, trust advisor, or trust protector, the trustee shall, within sixty days after the trustee has accepted trusteeship of the trust, or within sixty days after the date the trustee acquires knowledge that a formerly revocable trust has become irrevocable, notify the qualified beneficiaries of the trust's existence and of the right of the beneficiary to request a copy of the trust instrument pertaining to the beneficiary's interest in the trust. Except as otherwise provided by the terms of an irrevocable trust or otherwise directed in writing by the settlor, trust advisor, or trust protector, a trustee of an irrevocable trust: (1) Upon request of a qualified beneficiary, shall promptly furnish to the qualified beneficiary a copy of the trust instrument; (2) If notification of the trust has not been accomplished pursuant to this section within sixty days after accepting a trusteeship, shall notify the qualified beneficiaries of the acceptance and of the trustee's name, address, and telephone number; (3) Shall promptly respond to a qualified beneficiary's request for information related to the administration of the trust, unless the request is unreasonable under the circumstances. The settlor, trust advisor, or trust protector, may, by the terms of the governing instrument, or in writing delivered to the trustee, expand, restrict, eliminate, or otherwise modify the rights of beneficiaries to information relating to a trust. A beneficiary may waive the right to the notice or information otherwise required to be furnished under this section and, with respect to future reports and other information, may withdraw a waiver previously given. The change in the identity of a trustee, occurring as the result of a mere name change or a merger, consolidation, combination, or reorganization of a trustee, does not require notice. If a fiduciary is bound by a duty of confidentiality with respect to a trust or its assets, a fiduciary may require that any beneficiary who is eligible to receive information pursuant to this section be bound by the duty of confidentiality that binds the trustee before receiving such information from the trustee. A trust advisor, trust protector, or other fiduciary designated by the terms of the trust shall keep each excluded fiduciary designated by the terms of the trust reasonably informed about: (1) The administration of the trust with respect to any specific duty or function being performed by the trust advisor, trust protector, or other fiduciary to the extent that the duty or function would normally be performed by the excluded fiduciary or to the extent that providing such information to the excluded fiduciary is reasonably necessary for the excluded fiduciary to perform its duties; and (2) Any other material information that the excluded fiduciary would be required to disclose to the qualified beneficiaries under this section regardless of whether the terms of the trust relieve the excluded fiduciary from providing such information to qualified beneficiaries. Neither the performance nor the failure to perform of a trust advisor, trust protector, or other fiduciary designated by the terms of the trust as provided in this subdivision shall affect the limitation on the liability of the excluded fiduciary. The provisions of this section are effective for trusts created after June 30, 2002, except as otherwise directed by the settlor, trust protector, trust advisor, or other fiduciary designated by the terms of the trust. For trusts created before July 1, 2002, a trustee has no duty at common law or otherwise to notify a qualified beneficiary of the trust's existence unless otherwise directed by the settlor. Section 31. That \u00a7 55-2-18 be amended to read: 55-2-18. The exercise of the power to distribute the income or principal of the trust under \u00a7 55-2-15 shall be by an instrument in writing, signed and acknowledged by the trustee and filed with the records of the trust. The trustee of the first trust may notify all the beneficiaries of the first trust, in writing, at least twenty days prior to the effective date of the trustee's exercise of the power under \u00a7 55-2-15 (applying the South Dakota Virtual Representation Statutes, \u00a7\u00a7 55-3-31 to 55-3-38, inclusive sections 1 to 26, inclusive, of this Act). A copy of the proposed exercise of this authority and the second trust agreement shall satisfy this notice provision. For the purposes of this section, the term, beneficiaries, means those persons who would be entitled to notice and a copy of the first trust instrument under \u00a7 55-2-13. Section 32. That \u00a7 55-3-5 be amended to read: 55-3-5. A trustee must fulfill the purposes of the trust as declared at its creation, or as subsequently amended, and must follow all the directions of the trustor given at that time, except as modified by the consent of all parties interested, and upon approval by the court. For purposes of modifications by consent of all parties interested and modifications upon approval by the court, the provisions of sections 1 to 26, inclusive, of this Act apply to such modifications. Section 33. That \u00a7 55-3-24 be amended to read: 55-3-24. An irrevocable trust may be modified or terminated upon the consent of all of the beneficiaries if continuance of the trust on its existing terms is not necessary to carry out a material purpose. Whether or not continuance of the trust on its existing terms is necessary to carry out a material purpose, an irrevocable trust may be modified or terminated upon the consent of the trustor and all of the beneficiaries. Upon termination of a trust under this section, the trustee shall distribute the trust property in accordance with the trustor's probable intention or in any other manner as agreed by all the beneficiaries. The trustor's powers with respect to termination or modification may be exercised by an agent under a power of attorney only to the extent the power of attorney expressly so authorizes. A conservator may exercise the trustor's powers under this section only if approved by the court supervising the conservatorship. If the consent of a person under disability is required, such consent may be given by any person upon whom notice may be served pursuant to \u00a7 55-3-35. No person may be required to seek court affirmation of the trust's modification or termination made pursuant to this section. The provisions of sections 1 to 26, inclusive, of this Act apply to this section. Section 34. That \u00a7 55-3-45 be amended to read: 55-3-45. If a trust is not subject to court supervision under chapter 21-22, and if no objection has been made by a distribution beneficiary, as defined in this title, of a trust within one hundred eighty days after a copy of the trustee's accounting has been mailed, postage prepaid, to the last known address of such distribution beneficiary, personally, or electronically in accordance with \u00a7 15-6-5(d), the distribution beneficiary is deemed to have approved such accounting of the trustee, and the trustee, absent fraud, intentional misrepresentation, or material omission, shall be released and discharged from any and all liability to all beneficiaries of the trust as to all matters set forth in such accounting. The provisions of sections 1 to 26, inclusive, of this Act apply to this section. For purposes of this section, the term, accounting, means any interim or final report or other statement provided by a trustee reflecting all transactions, receipts, and disbursements during the reporting period and a list of assets as of the end of the period covered by the report or statement, and including written notice to the distribution beneficiary of the provisions of this section. Section 35. That \u00a7 55-4-57 be amended to read: 55-4-57. (a) A judicial proceeding to contest whether a revocable trust or any amendment thereto, or an irrevocable trust was validly created may not be commenced later than the first to occur of: (1) One year after the settlor's death; (2) Sixty days after the trustee, trust advisor, trust protector, or the settlor sent the person who is contesting the trust a copy of the trust instrument and a notice informing the person of the trust's existence, of the trustee's name and address, and of the time allowed for commencing a proceeding; (3) Upon notice of entry of an order of adjudication of the trust's validity as a result of a petition filed before the settlor's death by any fiduciary of the trust or the settlor of a trust; (4) Upon notice of entry of an order of any other adjudication of the trust's validity or the date the person's right to contest was precluded by consent or other limitation; (5) The last date a petition for review of a will could be filed under South Dakota law, if the trust was revocable at the settlor's death and the trust was specifically referred to in the settlor's last will; or (6) Upon notice of entry of a court's order approving a conservator's proposal to create a trust or amendment thereto if the trust or trust amendment was created pursuant to and in conformity with \u00a7 29A-5-419 or 29A-5-420. (b) Upon the death of the settlor of a trust that was revocable at the settlor's death, the trustee may proceed to distribute the trust property in accordance with the terms of the trust. The trustee is not subject to liability for doing so unless: (1) The trustee knows of a pending proceeding contesting the validity of the trust; or (2) A potential contestant has notified the trustee of a possible proceeding to contest the trust and a proceeding is commenced within sixty days after the contestant sent the notification. (c) A beneficiary of a trust that is determined to have been invalid is liable to return any distribution received for proper distribution. If the beneficiary refuses to return the distribution, the beneficiary may be liable for all costs, including attorney fees, incurred for the recovery of the distribution. (d) Notice given by the trustee, trust protector, trust advisor, or settlor under this section shall be given to all beneficiaries of a trust and all heirs at law of the trust settlor. (e) With respect to notices to beneficiaries and potential contestants under this section, if personal service is not made, then the notice shall be mailed certified or registered mail, postage prepaid, to the last known address of the person, and absent evidence to the contrary, notice to the person is presumed to have been made on the date of delivery to the last known address of the person, when there is proof of delivery. (f) No trustee, trust advisor, or trust protector may incur any liability to any person or otherwise for failure to provide any written notice discussed above. (g) The provisions of sections 1 to 26, inclusive, of this Act apply to this section. Section 36. That \u00a7\u00a7 55-3-31 to 55-3-38, inclusive, be repealed. Section 37. That \u00a7 29A-1-102 be amended to read: 29A-1-102. This code The South Dakota Uniform Probate Code shall be liberally construed and applied to promote simplification, clarification, and efficiency in the law of decedent's estates, guardianship and conservatorship, and multiple-party accounts and other nonprobate transfers. This code also includes \u00a7\u00a7 55-3-31 to 55-3-38, inclusive."}, {"bill_id": 7793, "bill_version_id": 43993, "bill_version": "Enrolled", "bill_version_date": "2017-02-07T10:15:25.34-06:00",
