BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 32-20B-5 be amended to read: 32-20B-5. Any person operating a bicycle upon a roadway at less than the normal speed of traffic at the time and place and under the conditions then existing shall ride as close as practicable to the right-hand curb or edge of the roadway. However, a person operating a bicycle may move from the right-hand curb or edge of the roadway to overtake and pass another bicycle or vehicle proceeding in the same direction, to prepare for a left turn at an intersection or into a private road or roadway, or to avoid conditions including, but not limited to, fixed or moving objects, parked or moving vehicles, bicycles, pedestrians, animals, or surface hazards, or substandard width lanes that make it unsafe to continue along the right-hand curb or edge. For purposes of this section, a \"substandard width lane\" is a lane that is too narrow for a bicycle and vehicle to travel safely side by side within the lane. If a person is operating a bicycle within a no passing zone on a roadway that has no shoulder or a shoulder of less than three feet in width, the person shall stop the bicycle, move the bicycle off the roadway, and allow a faster vehicle to pass. A violation of this section is a Class 2 misdemeanor."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 6893, "action_date": "2016-01-21T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 37869, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/37869.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 134, "committee_id_action": 325, "committee_id_assigned": 319, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 6893, "action_date": "2016-01-28T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 37887, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/37887.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 319, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 6893, "action_date": "2016-01-28T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 38392, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/38392.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to the 41st legislative day", "journal_page": 209, "committee_id_action": 319, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 20363, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [980, 983, 1027, 1034, 1007, 1052, 1023, 1069, 1032, 1033, 990], "Excused": [988, 1015]}}]}
