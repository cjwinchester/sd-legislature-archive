The landowner or lessee may not take possession of the deer or antelope parts or game bird unless a conservation officer has: (1) Examined the animal before it is moved from the location where it was initially found; (2) Conducted an investigation; and (3) Subsequently made a determination as to the presence or lack of reasonable suspicion of a violation of state law or rule. If evidence exists that the deer, antelope, or game bird was killed by a firearm or bow and arrow, the conservation officer shall consult with the officer's immediate supervisor to determine appropriate disposition of the antlers, horns, skull, or game bird."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 2367, "action_date": "2011-01-27T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 15854, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/15854.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 194, "committee_id_action": 115, "committee_id_assigned": 116, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 2367, "action_date": "2011-02-03T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 16112, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/16112.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 116, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 2367, "action_date": "2011-02-03T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 16264, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/16264.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to the 41st legislative day", "journal_page": 274, "committee_id_action": 116, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 8534, "president_vote": null, "Excused": [33, 32, 6, 29], "Yea": [61, 20, 71, 103, 99, 64, 73, 97, 66]}}]}
