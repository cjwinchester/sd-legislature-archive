Section 3. That \u00a7 10-6-33.29 be amended to read as follows: 10-6-33.29. The secretary of revenue shall enter into contracts with South Dakota State University and, if necessary, the South Dakota Agricultural Statistics Service for the purpose of creating a database to determine the agricultural income value of agricultural land by county.

The noncropland data may include: cash rents, rangeland acres, pastureland acres, rangeland AUM's per acre, pastureland AUM's per acre, grazing season data, and statewide cow and calf prices. The Agricultural Land Assessment Implementation and Oversight Advisory Property Assessment Task Force may recommend other cropland and noncropland data to the Legislature for subsequent use in the database. The secretary shall have such data collected for 2001, which will serve as the first year of the database, and each year thereafter. The database shall consist of the most recent eight years of data that have been collected and the two years, one year representing the highest agricultural income value and one year representing the lowest agricultural income value, shall be discarded from the database. The database for the 2010 assessment for taxes payable in 2011 shall consist of data from 2001 to 2008, inclusive, and the database for each assessment year thereafter shall be adjusted accordingly. South Dakota State University shall provide the data for each county to the secretary of revenue by June first of each year. Section 4.

Thereafter, the economics department shall submit such recommendations, if any, to the task force by September first of each year."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 5282, "action_date": "2014-01-29T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 29326, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/29326.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 148, "committee_id_action": 231, "committee_id_assigned": 232, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 5282, "action_date": "2014-02-04T16:07:10.81-06:00", "document_id": null, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/None.pdf", "status_text": "Withdrawn at the Request of the Prime Sponsor", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 231, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}]}
