(a) After a child support order issued in another state has been registered in this state, and unless the provisions of \u00a7 25-9B-613 apply, the responding tribunal of this state may modify that order only if, after notice and hearing, it finds that: (1) The following requirements are met: (i) The child, the individual obligee, and the obligor do not reside in the issuing state; (ii) One of the parties is a resident A petitioner who is a nonresident of this state seeks modification ; and (iii) The respondent is subject to the personal jurisdiction of the tribunal of this state; or (2) An individual party or the child is subject to the personal jurisdiction of the tribunal and all of the individual parties have filed a written consent in the issuing tribunal providing that a tribunal of this state may modify the support order and assume continuing, exclusive jurisdiction over the order.

If two or more tribunals have issued child support orders for the same obligor and child, the order that is controlling and must be recognized under the provisions of \u00a7 25-9B-207 establishes the nonmodifiable aspects of the support order. (d) On the issuance of an order modifying a child support order issued in another state, a tribunal of this state becomes the tribunal of continuing, exclusive jurisdiction. (e) Within thirty days after issuance of a modified child support order, the party obtaining the modification shall file a certified copy of the order with the issuing tribunal which had continuing, exclusive jurisdiction over the earlier order, and in each tribunal in which the party knows that earlier order has been registered.
