BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That chapter 23A-27A be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: A person, eighteen years of age or older, may express personal opposition to the death penalty by checking the box on the driver license or identification card application. The Department of Public Safety shall include the following question on the applications for a driver license or identification card: \"Should I die as a result of a violent crime, it is my wish that no person found guilty of homicide for my killing be subject to a death sentence.\" Checking the box authorizes the Department of Public Safety to include the person's name, date of birth, and social security number in a database of persons opposed to the death penalty. All information included in the database is confidential and may only be used if the person is a victim of a crime where the death penalty may be imposed. If the person is a victim of a crime where the death penalty may be imposed, the court may request that the department verify whether the person is included in the database. If the victim's name, date of birth, and social security number, is included on the list, the department shall forward the information to the court. When determining whether the death penalty should be imposed, the court shall consider the victim's inclusion on the database as evidence that the victim was opposed to the death penalty. A person may request removal from the database at any time with a signed and notarized request for removal mailed to the department or in person, with identification, at any location that accepts applications for a driver license or identification card. The department shall remove the person's name and other information from the database within one month of a request for removal."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 6404, "action_date": "2015-01-28T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 34023, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/34023.pdf", "status_text": "First Reading House", "journal_page": 217, "committee_id_action": 286, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 6404, "action_date": "2015-01-29T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 34099, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/34099.pdf", "status_text": "Referred to", "journal_page": 227, "committee_id_action": 286, "committee_id_assigned": 279, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 6404, "action_date": "2015-02-11T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 34705, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/34705.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 279, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 6404, "action_date": "2015-02-11T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 34870, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/34870.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to the 41st legislative day", "journal_page": 380, "committee_id_action": 279, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 18528, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [915, 884], "Yea": [947, 882, 879, 953, 881, 869, 912, 874, 954, 924], "Excused": [921]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/6404"}
