Section 2. That a NEW SECTION be added: 43-47-2. Classification of digital assets as property--Applicability to title 57A. The following provisions apply to a digital asset under title 57A: (1) A digital consumer asset is intangible personal property and a general intangible, as defined in \u00a7 57A-9-102, for the purposes of chapter 9 of title 57A; (2) A digital security is intangible personal property and a security, as defined in \u00a7 57A-8-102, and investment property, as defined in \u00a7 57A-9-102, for the purposes of chapters 8 and 9 of title 57A; (3) Virtual currency is intangible personal property and is money, notwithstanding the definition of money in \u00a7 57A-1-201, for the purposes of chapter 9 of title 57A; (4) Pursuant to subdivision 57A-8-102(9), a digital asset may be treated as a financial asset pursuant to a written agreement with the owner of the digital asset and, if treated as such, the digital asset shall remain intangible personal property; and (5) A bank providing a custodial service pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 43-47-5 to 43-47-7, inclusive, is a securities intermediary under subdivision 57A-8-102(14). Section 3. That a NEW SECTION be added: 43-47-3. Perfection of security interests in digital assets--Financing statements. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, including \u00a7 57A-9-310, perfection of a security interest in a digital asset may be achieved through possession or control, as applicable depending on how the asset is classified under \u00a7 43-47-2. A security interest held by a secured party having possession or control, as applicable, of a digital asset has priority over a security interest held by a secured party that does not have possession or control, as applicable. Perfection by possession creates a possessory security interest under subdivision 57A-9-301(2) in virtual currency or a digital security, based on the possessory nature of a private key or any substantially similar analogue. For purposes of chapter 57A-9 and this section, if collateral is required to be located in a jurisdiction, a digital asset is located in this state if the asset is possessed, controlled or otherwise held by a South Dakota bank, trust company, or other custodian, the debtor or secured party is physically located in this state, or the debtor or secured party is incorporated or organized in this state. Before a secured party may take possession or control of a digital asset under this section, the secured party shall enter into a security agreement with the debtor. The security agreement may set forth the terms under which a secured party may pledge its security interest in the digital asset as collateral for another transaction. A secured party may file a financing statement with the secretary of state that includes the proceeds from a digital asset pursuant to \u00a7 57A-9-315. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, including chapter 57A-9, a transferee takes a digital asset, perfected by filing, free of any security interest two years after the transferee takes the asset for value and does not have actual notice of an adverse claim. Section 4. That a NEW SECTION be added: 43-47-4. Means of control and possession. The means by which control may be obtained for purposes of chapter 57A-9 and this Act include compliance with the provisions of \u00a7 57A-8-106 through the use of a multi\u2011signature arrangement exclusive to the secured party, a private key, or a smart contract that is created by a secured party to comply with \u00a7 57A-8-106. The means by which possession may be obtained for purposes of chapter 57A-9 and this Act include delivery of a certificated security digital security, pursuant to \u00a7 57A-8-301, the use of a multi\u2011signature arrangement exclusive to the secured party, the use of a private key, or the use of a smart contract.
