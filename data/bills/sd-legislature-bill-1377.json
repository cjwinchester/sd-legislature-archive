Each series of bonds shall specify the portion of the property described in \u00a7 49-16B-55 to be acquired or improved with the proceeds of such series. The authority may issue an initial series of bonds in a principal amount not exceeding $20,000,000. However, no series of bonds may be issued by the authority unless and until the authority receives evidence satisfactory to it that the Dakota, Minnesota & Eastern Railroad Corporation meets the following financial tests: (1) The ratio of its long-term indebtedness to its equity (net worth) does not exceed 3/1; and (2) The ratio of its annual cash flow to the maximum annual debt service on its long-term indebtedness is at least 1.1/1. When each series of bonds has been paid or retired, and the state has been repaid for any moneys appropriated by the Legislature to replenish the capital reserve fund, the authority shall reconvey to the Dakota, Minnesota & Eastern Railroad Corporation the portion of the property described in \u00a7 49-16B-55, and all improvements thereto, financed with the proceeds of such series. To secure the authority's bonds or other obligations issued or incurred with respect to any property acquired by the authority pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 49-16B-55 to 49-16B-62, inclusive, the authority may grant to a trustee for the benefit of bondholders or to third parties a mortgage on or security interest in the authority's interest in such property. Any mortgage or security interest so granted with respect to any property may be on a parity with any existing mortgages on or security interests in such property. Section 211. That \u00a7 49-16B-57 be repealed. 49-16B-57. The authority shall establish a capital reserve fund for bonds issued pursuant to \u00a7 49-16B-56 and shall pay into the capital reserve fund any moneys appropriated or made available by the state for the fund, any proceeds from the sale of bonds to the extent provided in the authorizing resolution, and any other moneys which may be made available to the authority for the fund from any other source. The maximum annual debt service shall be the capital reserve requirement. For purposes of computing the capital reserve requirement, the annual debt service for any fiscal year shall be equal to the sum of all interest payable during the fiscal year on all bonds outstanding on the date of computation, plus the principal amount of all bonds outstanding on that date which mature or are subject to mandatory redemption during the fiscal year, all calculated on the assumption that such bonds will after their maturity date cease to be outstanding. The moneys in the capital reserve fund may not be less than the capital reserve requirement, except that withdrawals for payments of principal of and interest and redemption premiums on bonds issued under \u00a7 49-16B-56 may be made from the capital reserve fund if other moneys of the authority are not available. All moneys held in the capital reserve fund, except as hereinafter provided, shall be used solely for the payment of the principal of bonds secured by the fund, the purchase or redemption of bonds, the payment of interest on bonds, or the payment of any redemption premium required to be paid if the bonds are redeemed prior to maturity. Any income from the capital reserve fund may be transferred to other funds or accounts established with respect to the bonds, to the extent the transfer does not reduce the amount of the capital reserve fund below the capital reserve requirement. The authority may not issue bonds secured by the capital reserve fund if the capital reserve requirement exceeds the capital reserve fund at the time of issuance, unless the authority, at the time of issuance of such bonds, deposits in the fund an amount which, together with the amount then in the fund, will not be less than the new capital reserve requirement. The chairman of the board of directors of the authority shall annually submit to the Bureau of Finance and Management a budget estimate in accordance with \u00a7 4-7-7 stating the sum, if any, needed to restore the capital reserve fund to the level of the capital reserve requirement. In the event the chairman certifies a need to restore the capital reserve fund, the Governor shall submit a budget in accordance with \u00a7 4-7-9 including the sum, if any, needed to restore the capital reserve fund to the level of the capital reserve requirement. All sums appropriated by the Legislature for the restoration shall be deposited in the capital reserve fund. Section 212. That \u00a7 49-16B-58 be repealed. 49-16B-58. The authority shall lease any property acquired pursuant to \u00a7 49-16B-55 to the South Dakota Department of Transportation, Division of Air, Rail, and Transit, but the lease shall be made in accordance with the provisions of chapter 49-16B relating to leases to the division. The division shall sublease any property acquired pursuant to \u00a7 49-16B-55 only to the Dakota, Minnesota & Eastern Railroad Corporation, but the lease shall be made in accordance with the provisions of chapter 49-16B, and shall provide for payment of net sublease rentals sufficient in each year to pay the principal of and interest on the authority's bonds issued to finance the acquisition or improvement of such property and to repay the state for any moneys appropriated by the Legislature to replenish the capital reserve fund. The provisions of this section are subject to the provisions of any trust indenture or other document securing the bonds which grants a lien on or security interest in the property. Section 213. That \u00a7 49-16B-59 be repealed. 49-16B-59. Before issuing any bonds pursuant to \u00a7 49-16B-56, the authority shall determine that there are sufficient revenues, as described in \u00a7 49-16B-26, to provide for the timely payment of the principal of and interest on such bonds. Section 214. That \u00a7 49-16B-60 be repealed. 49-16B-60. The state hereby pledges and agrees with the holder of any bonds issued pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 49-16B-55 to 49-16B-61, inclusive, that the state will not limit or alter the rights vested in the authority to fulfill the terms of any agreement made with any holder or impair the rights and remedies of any holder until the bonds, together with the interest thereon, with interest on any unpaid installments of interest, and all costs in connection with any proceeding on behalf of any holder, are fully met and discharged. The authority may include this pledge and agreement in any agreement with the holder of any bonds. Section 215. That \u00a7 49-16B-61 be repealed. 49-16B-61. Nothing in \u00a7\u00a7 49-16B-55 to 49-16B-60, inclusive, validates or invalidates any rights of employees of the Dakota, Minnesota & Eastern Railroad Corporation. Section 216. That \u00a7 49-16B-62 be repealed. 49-16B-62. It is hereby declared: (1) That the efficient marketing and distribution of natural resources, agricultural and manufacturing commodities produced within the state, such as bentonite clay, wheat and wood products, and cement, is crucial to the economic health of the state as a whole and will further the public interest; (2) That the deteriorated condition of certain railroad properties and facilities located within the state and owned by the Dakota, Minnesota & Eastern Railroad Corporation, including properties and facilities located between milepost 375.7 and milepost 649.05, as well as the Onida branch line, seriously impedes the timely and efficient production, marketing, and distribution of such natural resources, and agricultural and manufacturing commodities; (3) That the improvement and reconstruction of the aforesaid railroad properties and facilities would have the effect of substantially decreasing transit time and assuring timely delivery of natural resources and agricultural and manufacturing commodities produced within the state, and would assure cost efficient access to distant markets for the producers of such commodities and thereby further the public interest; (4) That no other railroad facilities of similar capacity and comparable services are available in the same geographical area to the producers of the natural resources and agricultural and manufacturing commodities described above, and that the sole practicable and cost effective means of assuring that such commodities are marketed and distributed successfully is the improvement and reconstruction of the aforesaid railroad properties and facilities; (5) That for the foregoing reasons, it is of general economic benefit to the state and in the public interest to assist the financing of the improvement and reconstruction of the aforesaid railroad properties and facilities and that measures for such purposes should be adopted as soon as practicable.
