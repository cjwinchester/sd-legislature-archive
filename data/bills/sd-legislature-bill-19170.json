WHEREAS, there are rising medical costs, rising health insurance costs, and a rising number of individuals in need of medical assistance who have insufficient or no health insurance; and WHEREAS, many of those in need of medical assistance are not only experiencing difficulty with their health, but also must face the financial hardship which in itself can cause a delay in the healing process; and WHEREAS, there exists many not-for-profit organizations that are qualified and are presently working with these hardships and are witnessing this tremendous need to help those in need of medical assistance; and WHEREAS, there are private benefits being held for those in need of medical assistance and these benefits often have no qualified organization to professionally administer the benefit, ensure the delivery of the money to the correct person, or stop the chance of fraud; and WHEREAS, the current tax code prohibits pass-through contributions to not-for-profit organizations where the contributor designates the suffering person to which the contribution should go; and WHEREAS, contributions would increase to not-for-profit organizations if contributors could choose the recipient and know where their money is going; and WHEREAS, this would open the door for uncontrolled private benefits to be administered through qualified not-for-profit organizations; and WHEREAS, donations would increase since private benefit contributions are not tax deductible; and WHEREAS, the increased donations would help reduce the hardship of recipients and would help reduce the debts of recipients to hospitals, clinics, pharmacies, and other care giving establishments: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the Senate of the Seventy-ninth Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the House of Representatives concurring therein, that the South Dakota Legislature requests the state's congressional delegation to support a change to the federal tax code that would allow contributors to not-for-profit organizations, which provide medical assistance, to designate the person that should receive the medical assistance."}, {"bill_id": 19170, "bill_version_id": 101809, "bill_version": "Enrolled", "bill_version_date": "2004-02-23T08:53:31-06:00", "bill_text": ""}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 19170, "action_date": "2004-02-13T13:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 101350, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/101350.pdf", "status_text": "Introduced", "journal_page": 497, "committee_id_action": 832, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 19170, "action_date": "2004-02-17T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 101460, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/101460.pdf", "status_text": "Adopt Resolution", "journal_page": 518, "committee_id_action": 832, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 57767, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [3044, 3046, 3047, 3050, 3052, 3059, 3061, 3062, 3064, 3065, 3068, 3077, 3079, 3087, 3089, 3092, 3094, 3097, 3098, 3101, 3103, 3109, 3113, 3115, 3116, 3120, 3128, 3132, 3137, 3138, 3139, 3146], "Nay": [3066, 3093], "Excused": [3091]}}, {"bill_id": 19170, "action_date": "2004-02-18T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 101544, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/101544.pdf", "status_text": "Introduced", "journal_page": 646, "committee_id_action": 831, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 19170, "action_date": "2004-02-19T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 101633, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/101633.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to another day", "journal_page": 670, "committee_id_action": 831, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 19170, "action_date": "2004-02-20T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 101727, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/101727.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to another day", "journal_page": 699, "committee_id_action": 831, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 19170, "action_date": "2004-02-21T13:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 101795, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/101795.pdf", "status_text": "Concur In resolution", "journal_page": 718, "committee_id_action": 831, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 59597, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [3045, 3048, 3049, 3055, 3056, 3057, 3060, 3067, 3069, 3072, 3073, 3076, 3078, 3080, 3082, 3083, 3084, 3086, 3088, 3090, 3095, 3096, 3099, 3100, 3102, 3104, 3105, 3106, 3108, 3110, 3112, 3114, 3118, 3119, 3122, 3123, 3124, 3125, 3126, 3127, 3129, 3130, 3131, 3133, 3135, 3136, 3140, 3141, 3142, 3143, 3144, 3147, 3148, 3149, 3111], "Nay": [3051, 3053, 3054, 3070, 3071, 3074, 3075, 3081, 3085, 3121, 3145], "Excused": [3058, 3107, 3117, 3134]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/19170"}
