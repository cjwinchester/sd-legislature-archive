For purposes of section 1 of this Act, the term, nonmeandered lake, means any natural water body for which a meander line survey was not included as part of the official survey conducted by the United States surveyor general for the land on which the lake is situated. A meander line is a survey line used by the United States surveyor general to define the approximate margin of a natural body of water, primarily used for federal government land sales and land grants. A meander line is not, in itself, a topographical line or the boundary line for land ownership. A nonmeandered lake does not include a body of water created by a manmade impoundment constructed on privately owned land."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 5866, "action_date": "2014-01-31T13:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 29577, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/29577.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 250, "committee_id_action": 231, "committee_id_assigned": 225, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 5866, "action_date": "2014-02-20T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 30362, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/30362.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 225, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 5866, "action_date": "2014-02-20T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 30729, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/30729.pdf", "status_text": "Motion to amend", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 225, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 5866, "action_date": "2014-02-20T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 30729, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/30729.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass Amended", "journal_page": 480, "committee_id_action": 225, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 16371, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [451, 497, 454, 499, 462, 450, 423, 484, 505, 517, 511, 528, 480, 425], "Excused": [431]}}, {"bill_id": 5866, "action_date": "2014-02-20T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 30729, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/30729.pdf", "status_text": "Title amended", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 225, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 5866, "action_date": "2014-02-25T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 31052, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/31052.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass Amended", "journal_page": 538, "committee_id_action": 231, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 16582, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [528, 453, 522, 525, 467, 524, 456, 489, 517, 519, 449, 431, 455, 425, 504, 481, 509, 503, 477, 501, 520, 479, 457, 454, 523, 496, 458, 451, 466, 845, 499, 476, 521, 507, 478, 487, 423, 439, 500, 502, 497, 515, 511, 512, 463, 484, 462, 485, 514, 459, 464, 510, 450, 506, 430, 513, 468, 498, 516, 508, 480, 460, 448], "Nay": [527, 505, 442, 518, 461, 441], "Excused": [433]}}, {"bill_id": 5866, "action_date": "2014-02-26T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 31118, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/31118.pdf", "status_text": "First Reading Senate", "journal_page": 482, "committee_id_action": 229, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 5866, "action_date": "2014-02-27T13:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 31212, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/31212.pdf", "status_text": "Referred to", "journal_page": 499, "committee_id_action": 229, "committee_id_assigned": 205, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 5866, "action_date": "2014-03-04T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 31187, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/31187.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 205, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 5866, "action_date": "2014-03-04T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 31442, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/31442.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to the 41st legislative day", "journal_page": 529, "committee_id_action": 205, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 16893, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [495, 447, 436, 492, 491, 440, 434, 475, 429]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/5866"}
