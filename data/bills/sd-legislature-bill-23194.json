Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of South Dakota: Section 1. That \u00a7 12-4-5.4 be AMENDED: 12-4-5.4. Any person registering to vote shall provide the person's valid South Dakota driver license number, a tribal identification card number, or a South Dakota nondriver identification number on the voter registration form. If a person does not have a valid South Dakota driver license, tribal identification card, or a South Dakota nondriver identification number, the person shall must provide the last four digits of the person's social security number on the voter registration form. If a person does not have a valid South Dakota driver license, a tribal identification card, South Dakota nondriver identification number, or a social security number, the person may only register at the county auditor's office and shall must sign a statement verifying the fact that the person does not have a valid South Dakota driver license, a tribal identification card, South Dakota nondriver identification number, or a social security number. The statement shall must be prescribed by the State Board of Elections. For the purposes of this section, the term, tribal identification card, means an unexpired identification card issued by a South Dakota tribal government of a tribe recognized by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and that contains the legal name, date of birth, signature, and picture of the enrolled tribal member. Section 2. That \u00a7 12-4-5.5 be AMENDED: 12-4-5.5. At the time voter registration information is transmitted from a county to the statewide voter registration file, the authenticity of the driver license number or the South Dakota nondriver identification number shall must be verified with the driver license database. If the person has provided the last four digits of his or her the person's social security number, the social security database shall must be checked to determine that the number, name, and date of birth are accurate and that this information does belong to such person. If any of this information is reported as not being accurate, the county auditor shall withdraw the voter registration and attempt to get the correct information with the process provided in \u00a7 12-4-5.3. The State Board of Elections may shall promulgate rules, pursuant to chapter 1-26, determining technical parameters for the driver license and social security database verification, and for verifying the authenticity of a tribal identification card."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 23194, "action_date": "2022-01-26T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 229686, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/229686.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 127, "committee_id_action": 1008, "committee_id_assigned": 1016, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 23194, "action_date": "2022-02-02T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 231458, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/231458.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 1016, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 23194, "action_date": "2022-02-04T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 232301, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/232301.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 1016, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 23194, "action_date": "2022-02-04T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 232302, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/232302.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to the 41st legislative day", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 1016, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 72553, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [3912, 3916, 3923, 3941, 3942, 3946, 3954, 4011, 3957, 3982], "Nay": [3965, 3995], "Excused": [3989]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/23194"}
