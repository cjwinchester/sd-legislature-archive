Any person who is seeking to acquire title to any real property, which is subject to condemnation under power of eminent domain shall, at the initial meeting with the owner of each such parcel of real property, provide the landowner with the following statement in printed form: SUMMARY OF THE RIGHTS OF LANDOWNERS IN CONDEMNATION PROCEEDINGS: 1. The right to negotiate with the condemnor before condemnation proceedings begin. 2. The right to ask for a copy of any appraisal done by the condemnor or a written statement and summary showing the basis of the original offer by the condemnor. 3.

The right to have a court decide how much just compensation the property owner should receive because of the condemnation. 6.
