BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 10-64-1 be amended by adding a NEW SUBDIVISION to read: (12) The Supreme Court of the United States issued its decision in South Dakota v. Wayfair, 138 S.Ct. 2080 (2018), on June 21, 2018, holding: For these reasons, the Court concludes that the physical presence rule of Quill is unsound and incorrect. The Court's decisions in Quill Corp. v. North Dakota, 504 U.S. 298 (1992), and National Bellas Hess, Inc. v. Dept. of Revenue of Ill., 386 U.S. 753 (1967), should be, and now are, overruled. Wayfair, 138 S.Ct. at 2099. With the Supreme Court's decision in Wayfair that the physical presence rule of Quill and Bellas Hess is \"unsound and incorrect\" and that Quill and Bellas Hess are \"overruled,\" the Legislature hereby finds that the purpose of the declaratory judgment provision in 2016 Senate Bill 106, codified in \u00a7 10-64-3, has been fulfilled and completed. Section 2. That \u00a7 10-64-3 be amended to read: 10-64-3. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, and whether or not the state initiates an audit or other tax collection procedure, the state may bring a declaratory judgment action under chapter 21-24 in any circuit court against any person the state believes meets the criteria of \u00a7 10-64-2 to establish that the obligation to remit sales tax is applicable and valid under state and federal law. The circuit court shall act on this declaratory judgment action as expeditiously as possible and this action shall proceed with priority over any other action presenting the same question in any other venue. In this action, the court shall presume that the matter may be fully resolved through a motion to dismiss or a motion for summary judgment. However, if these motions do not resolve the action, any discovery allowed by the court may not exceed the provisions of subdivisions 15-6-73(2) and (4). The provisions of \u00a7 10-59-34, along with any other provisions authorizing attorney's fees, do not apply to any action brought pursuant to this chapter or any appeal from any action brought pursuant to this chapter. No declaratory judgment action may be initiated pursuant to this section or this chapter at any time after the effective date of this Act. Section 3. That \u00a7 10-64-4 be amended to read: 10-64-4. The filing of the declaratory judgment action established in this chapter by the state operates as an injunction during the pendency of the action, applicable to each state entity, prohibiting any state entity from enforcing the obligation in \u00a7 10-64-2 against any taxpayer who does not affirmatively consent or otherwise remit the sales tax on a voluntary basis. The injunction does not apply if there is a previous judgment from a court establishing the validity of the obligation in \u00a7 10-64-2 with respect to the particular taxpayer. Except as to a defendant in an action initiated by the state pursuant to \u00a7 10-64-3, any injunction imposed by this section is automatically dissolved and lifted on November 1, 2018. Section 4. That \u00a7 10-64-6 be amended to read: 10-64-6. No obligation to collect or remit the sales tax required by this chapter may be applied retroactively before November 1, 2018. Section 5. That \u00a7 10-64-7 be amended to read: 10-64-7. If an injunction provided by this chapter is lifted or dissolved, in general or with respect to a specific taxpayer as to a defendant in an action initiated by the state pursuant to \u00a7 10-64-3, the state shall assess and apply the obligation established in \u00a7 10-64-2 from that date forward with respect to any taxpayer covered by the injunction. Section 6. Whereas, this Act is necessary for the support of the state government and its existing public institutions, an emergency is hereby declared to exist, and this Act shall be in full force and effect from and after its passage and approval."}, {"bill_id": 9385, "bill_version_id": 51042, "bill_version": "Enrolled", "bill_version_date": "2018-09-12T14:43:49.937-05:00", "bill_text": ""}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 9385, "action_date": "2018-09-12T10:00:00-05:00", "document_id": 51036, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/51036.pdf", "status_text": "First read in Senate and referral to committee waived pursuant to JR 6D-1", "journal_page": 9, "committee_id_action": 405, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 9385, "action_date": "2018-09-12T10:00:00-05:00", "document_id": 51036, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/51036.pdf", "status_text": "Placed on calendar", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 405, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 9385, "action_date": "2018-09-12T10:00:00-05:00", "document_id": 51035, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/51035.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referral to committee waived pursuant to JR 6D-1", "journal_page": 13, "committee_id_action": 404, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 9385, "action_date": "2018-09-12T10:00:00-05:00", "document_id": 51036, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/51036.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass", "journal_page": 14, "committee_id_action": 405, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 26989, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [1467, 1498, 1468, 1455, 1481, 1465, 1457, 1507, 1524, 1469, 1512, 1538, 1504, 1462, 1501, 1523, 1456, 1479, 1515, 1459, 1480, 1505, 1486, 1474, 1555, 1522, 1458, 1477, 1510, 1534], "Excused": [1496, 1506], "Nay": [1471, 1478, 1470]}}, {"bill_id": 9385, "action_date": "2018-09-12T10:00:00-05:00", "document_id": 51035, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/51035.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass", "journal_page": 15, "committee_id_action": 404, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 26999, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [1213, 1269, 1297, 1424, 1268, 1284, 1279, 1214, 1223, 1307, 1301, 1425, 1282, 1260, 1311, 1308, 1312, 1291, 1275, 1283, 1250, 1286, 1222, 1302, 1306, 1265, 1315, 1316, 1296, 1292, 1248, 1310, 1226, 1280, 1263, 1274, 1253, 1295, 1249, 1277, 1303, 1259, 1255, 1299, 1225, 1256, 1261, 1240, 1258, 1305, 1254, 1287, 1257, 1236, 1215, 1317, 1216, 1229, 1298, 1285, 1451, 1503, 1531, 1551, 1502, 1518, 1513, 1553, 1452, 1461, 1541, 1535, 1552, 1516, 1494, 1545, 1542, 1546, 1525, 1509, 1517, 1485, 1520, 1460, 1536, 1540, 1499, 1548, 1549, 1530, 1526, 1483, 1544, 1464, 1514, 1497, 1508, 1529, 1484, 1511, 1537, 1493, 1489, 1533, 1554, 1463, 1490, 1495, 1476, 1492, 1539, 1488, 1521, 1491, 1473, 1453, 1550, 1454, 1466, 1532, 1519, 1487], "Nay": [1266, 1294, 1247, 1309, 1500, 1528, 1482, 1543], "Excused": [1235, 1238, 1314, 1293, 1472, 1475, 1547, 1527]}}, {"bill_id": 9385, "action_date": "2018-09-12T10:00:00-05:00", "document_id": 51035, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/51035.pdf", "status_text": "Signed by the Speaker", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 404, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 9385, "action_date": "2018-09-12T10:00:00-05:00", "document_id": 51036, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/51036.pdf", "status_text": "Signed by the President", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 405, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 9385, "action_date": "2018-09-12T10:00:00-05:00", "document_id": 51036, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/51036.pdf", "status_text": "Delivered to the Governor", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 405, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 9385, "action_date": "2018-09-12T10:00:00-05:00", "document_id": 51036, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/51036.pdf", "status_text": "Signed by the Governor", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 405, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}], "session_law": 7056, "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/9385"}
