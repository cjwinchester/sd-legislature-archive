A Class A or B felony commuted to a number of years shall be applied to the Class C violent column of the grid. An inmate convicted of a Class A or B felony who was a juvenile at the time of the offense and receives a sentence of less than life shall be applied to the Class C violent column of the grid."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 11917, "action_date": "2020-01-30T13:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 65050, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/65050.pdf", "status_text": "First read in Senate and referred to", "journal_page": 118, "committee_id_action": 447, "committee_id_assigned": 451, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 11917, "action_date": "2020-02-25T08:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 68182, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/68182.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 451, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 11917, "action_date": "2020-02-25T08:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 68183, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/68183.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to the 41st legislative day", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 451, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 33710, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [1685, 1703, 1752, 1716, 1718], "Nay": [1663, 1726]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/11917"}
