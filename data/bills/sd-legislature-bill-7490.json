For the purpose of continuing a fund for the payment of pensions to retired employees of a school district that has established such system, the school district may levy an annual tax not exceeding thirty cents per thousand dollars of taxable valuation of the school district for the current year. The levy may not be included in determining the tax levy limitation of the school district provided by law. Moneys collected from the tax shall be kept by the business manager in a special pension fund and may not be used for any other purpose except upon discontinuance of the pension system by the school district, in which case any unexpended balance shall be transferred to the general fund. For taxes payable in 2011, the total amount of revenue payable from the levy provided in this section may not increase more than the lesser of three percent or the index factor, as defined in \u00a7 10-13-38, over the maximum amount of revenue that could have been generated for the taxes payable in 2010. After applying the index factor, a school district may increase the revenue payable from taxes on real property above the limitations provided by this section by the percentage increase of value resulting from any improvements or change in use of real property, annexation, minor boundary changes, and any adjustments in taxation of real property separately classified and subject to statutory adjustments and reductions under chapters 10-4, 10-6, 10-6A, and 10-6B, except \u00a7 10-6-31.4, only if assessed the same as property of equal value. For taxes payable in 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015, the total amount of revenue payable from the levy provided in this section may not increase more than the lesser of three percent or the index factor, as defined in \u00a7 10-13-38, over the maximum amount of revenue that could have been generated for the taxes payable in 2010 plus any unused index factor from the previous years.

For the purposes of subdivisions 13-13-10.1(1) and 13-13-10.1(1A), a pupil or \u00a7 13-13-10.1, a student is enrolled if: (1) The pupil or student is less than twenty-one years of age on the first day of July or meets the requirements of \u00a7 13-28-5 and 13-28-6; and (2) The pupil or student has not completed an approved program or graduated from high school; and (3) The pupil's or student's parent or guardian resides within the school district, or in the case of an emancipated minor the pupil or student resides within the district or the pupil or student has been properly assigned to the district or has been approved to attend school in the district under the terms of the enrollment options program established in \u00a7 13-28-40; and (4) The pupil or student is not simultaneously enrolled in any other school district and has not been excused from school attendance under the terms of \u00a7 13-27-1.1 or 13-27-2. Section 6. That \u00a7 13-13-10.5 be amended to read: 13-13-10.5. For purposes of state aid to education, a student enrolled pursuant to \u00a7 13-28-41 or 13-28-51 shall be counted in a school's average daily membership fall enrollment as defined in subdivision 13-13-10.1(1) \u00a7 13-13-10.1 in a proportion equal to the share of the student's enrollment in the school. Section 7. That \u00a7 13-13-72 be amended to read: 13-13-72. It is the policy of the Legislature that the appropriation for state aid to education increase on an annual basis by the percentage increase in local need on an aggregate statewide basis so that the relative proportion of local need paid by local effort and state aid shall remain constant. For school fiscal year 2013, it is the policy of the Legislature that the relative proportion of the total local need paid by state aid shall be amended by adjusting the proportion of state aid to fifty-three and eight-tenths percent of the total local need. However, the increase in the per student allocation on an annual basis that exceeds three percent shall be paid solely by the state and is not a factor in this policy. For school fiscal years 2017 to 2022, inclusive, the proportion of local need paid by local effort and state aid shall be adjusted annually to maintain the proportion between state aid and local property taxes and to reflect adjustments in local effort due to the implementation of the other revenue base amount as defined in \u00a7 13-13-10.1. Section 8. That \u00a7 13-13-72.1 be amended to read: 13-13-72.1. Any adjustments in the levies specified in \u00a7 10-12-42 made pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 13- 13-71 and 13-13-72 shall be based on maintaining the relationship between statewide local effort as a percentage of statewide local need in the fiscal year succeeding the fiscal year in which the adjustment is made. For school fiscal years 2017 to 2022, inclusive, the proportion of local need paid by local effort and state aid shall be adjusted annually to reflect adjustments in local effort due to the implementation of the other revenue base amount as defined in \u00a7 13-13-10.1. However, for fiscal year 2013 and each year thereafter, if the levies specified in \u00a7 10-12-42 are not adjusted to maintain this relationship, the per student allocation target teacher salary as defined in \u00a7 13-13-10.1(4) 13-13-10.1 shall be reduced to maintain the relationship between statewide local effort as a percentage of statewide local need. Any adjustment to the levy for agricultural property shall be based upon the change in the statewide agricultural taxable valuation and the reclassification of agricultural property to another property classification. Any adjustment to the levies for nonagricultural property and owner-occupied single-family dwellings shall be based upon the change in the statewide nonagricultural property and owner-occupied single-family dwellings taxable valuations. However, if any new project with a total taxable valuation of one hundred fifty million dollars or more is constructed, the levies shall be proportionately decreased for agricultural property, nonagricultural property, and owner-occupied single-family dwellings. In addition to the adjustments in the levies provided by this section, the levies for nonagricultural property and owner-occupied single-family dwellings shall also be adjusted as necessary to account for the additional increase in the total assessed value for nonagricultural property and owner-occupied single-family dwellings pursuant to the phasing out and repeal of the provisions provided in \u00a7 10-6-74. Section 9. That \u00a7 13-13-73 be amended to read: 13-13-73. The secretary of the Department of Education shall compute state aid to education for each school district according to the following calculations: (1) Determine each school district's fall enrollment; (2) To arrive at the local need per district: (a) Multiply the per student allocation by the fall enrollment; (b) Multiply the small school adjustment, if applicable, by the fall enrollment; (c) Calculate the limited English proficiency (LEP) adjustment pursuant to subdivision (2D), if applicable; and (d) Add the product of subsection (a) to the product of subsection (b) and to the calculation in subsection (c); (3) State aid is (a) local need as defined in \u00a7 13-13-10.1 minus local effort, or (b) zero if the calculation in (a) is a negative number; (4)(2) If the state aid appropriation for the general support of education is in excess of the entitlement provided for in this section and the entitlement provided for in \u00a7 13-13-85, the excess shall be used to fund any shortfall of the appropriation as provided for in \u00a7 13-37-36.3. The secretary shall report to the Governor by January seventh of each year, the amount of state aid necessary to fully fund the general aid formula in the current year. If a shortfall in the state aid appropriation for general education exists that cannot be covered by \u00a7 13-37-45, the Governor shall inform the Legislature and provide a proposal to eliminate the shortfall. Section 10. That \u00a7 13-13-79 be amended to read: 13-13-79. At the same time that state aid is distributed to school districts pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 13-13-10.1 to 13-13-41, inclusive, the secretary of the Department of Education shall distribute funds to sparse school districts by multiplying the result of the calculation in either subdivision 13-13-78(2) or subdivision 13-13-78(3) by seventy-five percent of the per student allocation equivalent as defined in \u00a7 13-13-10.1.

For purposes of state aid to education, a student enrolled pursuant to \u00a7 13-28-41 or 13-28-51 shall be counted in a school's average daily membership fall enrollment as defined in subdivision 13-13-10.1(1) \u00a7 13-13-10.1 in a proportion equal to the share of the student's enrollment in the school. Section 7. That \u00a7 13-13-72 be amended to read: 13-13-72. It is the policy of the Legislature that the appropriation for state aid to education increase on an annual basis by the percentage increase in local need on an aggregate statewide basis so that the relative proportion of local need paid by local effort and state aid shall remain constant. For school fiscal year 2013, it is the policy of the Legislature that the relative proportion of the total local need paid by state aid shall be amended by adjusting the proportion of state aid to fifty-three and eight-tenths percent of the total local need. However, the increase in the per student allocation on an annual basis that exceeds three percent shall be paid solely by the state and is not a factor in this policy. For school fiscal years 2017 to 2022, inclusive, the proportion of local need paid by local effort and state aid shall be adjusted annually to maintain the proportion between state aid and local property taxes and to reflect adjustments in local effort due to the implementation of the other revenue base amount as defined in \u00a7 13-13-10.1. Section 8. That \u00a7 13-13-72.1 be amended to read: 13-13-72.1.

For school fiscal years 2017 to 2022, inclusive, the proportion of local need paid by local effort and state aid shall be adjusted annually to reflect adjustments in local effort due to the implementation of the other revenue base amount as defined in \u00a7 13-13-10.1. However, for fiscal year 2013 and each year thereafter, if the levies specified in \u00a7 10-12-42 are not adjusted to maintain this relationship, the per student allocation target teacher salary as defined in \u00a7 13-13-10.1(4) 13-13-10.1 shall be reduced to maintain the relationship between statewide local effort as a percentage of statewide local need. Any adjustment to the levy for agricultural property shall be based upon the change in the statewide agricultural taxable valuation and the reclassification of agricultural property to another property classification. Any adjustment to the levies for nonagricultural property and owner-occupied single-family dwellings shall be based upon the change in the statewide nonagricultural property and owner-occupied single-family dwellings taxable valuations. However, if any new project with a total taxable valuation of one hundred fifty million dollars or more is constructed, the levies shall be proportionately decreased for agricultural property, nonagricultural property, and owner-occupied single-family dwellings. In addition to the adjustments in the levies provided by this section, the levies for nonagricultural property and owner-occupied single-family dwellings shall also be adjusted as necessary to account for the additional increase in the total assessed value for nonagricultural property and owner-occupied single-family dwellings pursuant to the phasing out and repeal of the provisions provided in \u00a7 10-6-74.

The secretary shall report to the Governor by January seventh of each year, the amount of state aid necessary to fully fund the general aid formula in the current year. If a shortfall in the state aid appropriation for general education exists that cannot be covered by \u00a7 13-37-45, the Governor shall inform the Legislature and provide a proposal to eliminate the shortfall. Section 10. That \u00a7 13-13-79 be amended to read: 13-13-79.

For purposes of state aid to education, a student enrolled pursuant to \u00a7 13-28-41 or 13-28-51 shall be counted in a school's average daily membership fall enrollment as defined in subdivision 13-13-10.1(1) \u00a7 13-13-10.1 in a proportion equal to the share of the student's enrollment in the school. Section 7. That \u00a7 13-13-72 be amended to read: 13-13-72. It is the policy of the Legislature that the appropriation for state aid to education increase on an annual basis by the percentage increase in local need on an aggregate statewide basis so that the relative proportion of local need paid by local effort and state aid shall remain constant. For school fiscal year 2013, it is the policy of the Legislature that the relative proportion of the total local need paid by state aid shall be amended by adjusting the proportion of state aid to fifty-three and eight-tenths percent of the total local need. However, the increase in the per student allocation on an annual basis that exceeds three percent shall be paid solely by the state and is not a factor in this policy. For school fiscal years 2017 to 2022, inclusive, the proportion of local need paid by local effort and state aid shall be adjusted annually to maintain the proportion between state aid and local property taxes and to reflect adjustments in local effort due to the implementation of the other revenue base amount as defined in \u00a7 13-13-10.1. Section 8. That \u00a7 13-13-72.1 be amended to read: 13-13-72.1.

For school fiscal years 2017 to 2022, inclusive, the proportion of local need paid by local effort and state aid shall be adjusted annually to reflect adjustments in local effort due to the implementation of the other revenue base amount as defined in \u00a7 13-13-10.1. However, for fiscal year 2013 and each year thereafter, if the levies specified in \u00a7 10-12-42 are not adjusted to maintain this relationship, the per student allocation target teacher salary as defined in \u00a7 13-13-10.1(4) 13-13-10.1 shall be reduced to maintain the relationship between statewide local effort as a percentage of statewide local need. Any adjustment to the levy for agricultural property shall be based upon the change in the statewide agricultural taxable valuation and the reclassification of agricultural property to another property classification. Any adjustment to the levies for nonagricultural property and owner-occupied single-family dwellings shall be based upon the change in the statewide nonagricultural property and owner-occupied single-family dwellings taxable valuations. However, if any new project with a total taxable valuation of one hundred fifty million dollars or more is constructed, the levies shall be proportionately decreased for agricultural property, nonagricultural property, and owner-occupied single-family dwellings. In addition to the adjustments in the levies provided by this section, the levies for nonagricultural property and owner-occupied single-family dwellings shall also be adjusted as necessary to account for the additional increase in the total assessed value for nonagricultural property and owner-occupied single-family dwellings pursuant to the phasing out and repeal of the provisions provided in \u00a7 10-6-74.

If a school district chooses not to use the alternative local need calculation, the school district may not use that calculation in any subsequent school year. The secretary of the Department of Education shall compute state aid to education for each school district according to the following calculations: (1) Determine each school district's fall enrollment; (2) To arrive at the local need per district: (a) Multiply the per student allocation by the fall enrollment; (b) Multiply the small school adjustment, if applicable, by the fall enrollment; (c) Calculate the limited English proficiency (LEP) adjustment pursuant to subdivision (2D), if applicable; and (d) Add the product of subsection (a) to the product of subsection (b) and to the calculation in subsection (c); (3) State For school districts not utilizing the alternative local need calculation, state aid is (a) local need as defined in \u00a7 13-13-10.1 minus local effort, or (b) zero if the calculation in (a) is a negative number; (4)(2) For school districts utilizing the alternative local need calculation, state aid is the alternative local need as defined in subdivision 13-13-10.1(5B) minus local effort, or zero if the calculation is a negative number; (3) If the state aid appropriation for the general support of education is in excess of the entitlement provided for in this section and the entitlement provided for in \u00a7 13-13-85, the excess shall be used to fund any shortfall of the appropriation as provided for in \u00a7 13-37-36.3. The secretary shall report to the Governor by January seventh of each year, the amount of state aid necessary to fully fund the general aid formula in the current year.

Section 7. That \u00a7 13-13-72 be amended to read: 13-13-72. It is the policy of the Legislature that the appropriation for state aid to education increase on an annual basis by the percentage increase in local need on an aggregate statewide basis so that the relative proportion of local need paid by local effort and state aid shall remain constant. For school fiscal year 2013, it is the policy of the Legislature that the relative proportion of the total local need paid by state aid shall be amended by adjusting the proportion of state aid to fifty-three and eight-tenths percent of the total local need. However, the increase in the per student allocation on an annual basis that exceeds three percent shall be paid solely by the state and is not a factor in this policy. For school fiscal years 2017 to 2022, inclusive, the proportion of local need paid by local effort and state aid shall be adjusted annually to maintain the proportion between state aid and local property taxes and to reflect adjustments in local effort due to the implementation of the other revenue base amount as defined in \u00a7 13-13-10.1.

However, for fiscal year 2013 and each year thereafter, if the levies specified in \u00a7 10-12-42 are not adjusted to maintain this relationship, the per student allocation target teacher salary as defined in \u00a7 13-13-10.1(4) 13-13-10.1 shall be reduced to maintain the relationship between statewide local effort as a percentage of statewide local need. Any adjustment to the levy for agricultural property shall be based upon the change in the statewide agricultural taxable valuation and the reclassification of agricultural property to another property classification. Any adjustment to the levies for nonagricultural property and owner-occupied single-family dwellings shall be based upon the change in the statewide nonagricultural property and owner-occupied single-family dwellings taxable valuations. However, if any new project with a total taxable valuation of one hundred fifty million dollars or more is constructed, the levies shall be proportionately decreased for agricultural property, nonagricultural property, and owner-occupied single-family dwellings. In addition to the adjustments in the levies provided by this section, the levies for nonagricultural property and owner-occupied single-family dwellings shall also be adjusted as necessary to account for the additional increase in the total assessed value for nonagricultural property and owner-occupied single-family dwellings pursuant to the phasing out and repeal of the provisions provided in \u00a7 10-6-74.

If a school district chooses not to use the alternative local need calculation, the school district may not use that calculation in any subsequent school year. The secretary of the Department of Education shall compute state aid to education for each school district according to the following calculations: (1) Determine each school district's fall enrollment; (2) To arrive at the local need per district: (a) Multiply the per student allocation by the fall enrollment; (b) Multiply the small school adjustment, if applicable, by the fall enrollment; (c) Calculate the limited English proficiency (LEP) adjustment pursuant to subdivision (2D), if applicable; and (d) Add the product of subsection (a) to the product of subsection (b) and to the calculation in subsection (c); (3) State For school districts not utilizing the alternative local need calculation, state aid is (a) local need as defined in \u00a7 13-13-10.1 minus local effort, or (b) zero if the calculation in (a) is a negative number; (4)(2) For school districts utilizing the alternative local need calculation, state aid is the alternative local need as defined in subdivision 13-13-10.1(5B) minus local effort, or zero if the calculation is a negative number; (3) If the state aid appropriation for the general support of education is in excess of the entitlement provided for in this section and the entitlement provided for in \u00a7 13-13-85, the excess shall be used to fund any shortfall of the appropriation as provided for in \u00a7 13-37-36.3. The secretary shall report to the Governor by January seventh of each year, the amount of state aid necessary to fully fund the general aid formula in the current year. If a shortfall in the state aid appropriation for general education exists that cannot be covered by \u00a7 13-37-45, the Governor shall inform the Legislature and provide a proposal to eliminate the shortfall.

In addition, a school district which reimburses for mileage instead of providing transportation pursuant to \u00a7 13-30-3, may use the capital outlay fund to pay for fifteen percent of its mileage reimbursement costs. The capital outlay fund may be used to purchase textbooks and instructional software. The capital outlay fund may be used to purchase warranties on capital assets if the warranties do not include supplies. During the period of time beginning on July 1, 2009, and ending on June 30, 2018, any A school district may make payments transfer from its capital outlay fund for the purchase of property insurance and casualty insurance, for payments for energy costs and the cost of utilities, and for motor fuel or for any portion of a contract providing transportation to students or for any mileage reimbursements. However, the total amount that a school district expends from its capital outlay fund for these expenses may to its general fund an amount not to exceed forty-five percent of the total tax revenues deposited in that fund during the current school fiscal year, and for any school district with a current tax levy for the capital outlay fund that is greater than its tax levy for the capital outlay fund in school fiscal year 2008, the total amount expended from the capital outlay fund for these expenses may not exceed forty-five percent of the total tax revenues that would have been deposited in that fund during the current school fiscal year if the tax levy for the capital outlay fund had not been increased since 2008. Section 16. That \u00a7 13-16-26 be amended to read: 13-16-26. All or any part of a surplus of any school district fund, except the capital outlay fund provided by \u00a7\u00a7 13-16-6 to 13-16-9, inclusive, and the special education fund provided by \u00a7 13-37-16 may be transferred to any other school district fund. Only a school district with a plan for reorganization that has been approved by the voters pursuant to \u00a7 13-6-47 after July 1, 2007 may transfer within twelve months before the effective date of the reorganization all or any part of a surplus in the capital outlay fund to the general fund. Any unused portion of money that has been transferred into the special education fund may be transferred from the special education fund within the current fiscal year to the fund from which it originated. All or any part of any school district fund may be loaned to any other school district fund for a term not to exceed twenty-four months. The restriction on a transfer from the capital outlay fund in this section does not apply to any transfer from the capital outlay fund to the general fund as authorized in \u00a7 13-16-6. Section 17. That \u00a7 13-28-11 be amended to read: 13-28-11. If a child is residing in a residential treatment center or an intensive residential treatment center which provides care for children who are not living with their parents or guardian, the school residence of the child is the school district where the parents or guardian reside, subject to the provisions of \u00a7 13-28-9. The school district where a residential treatment center or intensive residential treatment center is located is responsible for providing an educational program for the children who reside in the residential treatment center or intensive residential treatment center. Tuition for a child enrolled in a public school district is the responsibility of the school district where the child was enrolled at the time of placement in the residential treatment center or intensive residential treatment center. The amount of tuition paid by that school district for any child placed in a residential treatment center or intensive residential treatment center who is not eligible for special education services at the time of placement shall be calculated as follows: (1) Divide the current per student allocation equivalent as defined in subdivision 13-13-10.1(4) \u00a7 13-13-10.1 by one hundred seventy-five; and (2) Multiply the result obtained in subdivision (1) by the number of days the child is placed. This section applies only to a residential treatment center or intensive residential treatment center that provided an educational program through a school district in the 2013-2014 school year or that initiates an educational program through a school district in a subsequent school year. This section does not apply to any placement by the Unified Judicial System, the Department of Corrections, the Department of Social Services, or any entity approved by the Department of Social Services, including a foster home. Section 18. That \u00a7 13-28-19.1 be amended to read: 13-28-19.1. If a school district that was contracting pursuant to \u00a7 13-15-11, dissolves and is annexed to another school district prior to before July 1, 2010, the school board for the school district to which the former contracting school district is annexed shall, for the current school year and for each school year thereafter, assign the students who reside in land area that was part of the former contracting district to the school that was receiving the students under the contract. The rate of tuition paid per year to the receiving school district may not be less than the per student allocation equivalent as defined in \u00a7 13-13-10.1 for that school fiscal year. In addition, the school district to which the former contracting school district is annexed may compensate the receiving school district for all or any portion of the transportation or other costs associated with the students attending school in the receiving school district. If the parent or guardian of a student assigned to a school district in a bordering state pursuant to this section disapproves of the student's assignment, the school board shall assign that student to an attendance center within the district. However, notwithstanding any other provision of law, the school district is not required to provide transportation to that student. Section 19. That \u00a7 13-28A-2.1 be amended to read: 13-28A-2.1. Any agreement to allow the regulation of tuition paid between South Dakota school districts and a bordering state's school districts entered into pursuant to this chapter shall specify the tuition rate to be paid by all local school districts on behalf of students enrolled in the school district of a bordering state. However, no tuition regulation program agreement established pursuant to \u00a7 13-28A-1 may specify a rate of tuition that is greater than one hundred ten percent of the per student allocation equivalent as defined in subdivision 13-13-10.1(4) \u00a7 13-13-10.1. Section 20. That \u00a7 13-28A-14 be amended to read: 13-28A-14. If the rate of tuition specified in a tuition regulation program agreement established pursuant to \u00a7 13-28A-1 is greater than the per student allocation equivalent as defined in subdivision 13-13-10.1(4) \u00a7 13-13-10.1, any South Dakota school district that pays tuition to a bordering state school district in accordance with that agreement is entitled to the difference between the rate of tuition and the per student allocation equivalent for each student for whom tuition is paid. If the rate of tuition specified in a tuition regulation program agreement established pursuant to \u00a7 13-28A-1 is less than the per student allocation equivalent, any South Dakota school district that receives tuition from a bordering state school district in accordance with that agreement is entitled to the difference between the per student allocation equivalent and the rate of tuition for each student for whom tuition is received. The entitlements created in this section shall be paid out of money appropriated in the general appropriations act for state aid to education. Section 21. That \u00a7 13-55-49 be amended to read: 13-55-49. The amount of the scholarship shall be calculated as follows: (1) Multiply the per student allocation as defined in subdivision 13-13-10.1(4) by seventy-five percent; and (2) Multiply the result of subdivision (1) by the percentage of the statewide local need as defined in subdivision 13-13-10.1(5) that is paid with funds appropriated for state aid to general education pursuant to chapter 13-13 one thousand five hundred dollars for the first year of attendance. One half of the award shall be paid to an approved institution on behalf of any eligible student there enrolled at the beginning of the fall semester, and the other half shall be paid in the same manner at the beginning of the spring semester. A student must shall be enrolled full-time during the spring semester in order to receive the second installment. Section 22. That the code be amended by adding a NEW SECTION to read: There is hereby created the Teacher Compensation Review Board within the Department of Education. The board shall review teacher compensation, including comparable wage indexes, in surrounding states at the completion of every three school years. The board will report its findings to the Governor and the Legislature no later than September 30, 2018, and by September thirtieth in every third year thereafter. The initial appointment of the members to the board shall be made no later than March 1, 2018. The members shall serve a term of three years. The board shall consist of nine members to be appointed as follows: (1) Three members of the South Dakota Senate appointed by the president pro tempore of the Senate, no more than two of whom may be from the same political party; (2) Three members of the South Dakota House of Representatives appointed by the speaker of the House of Representatives, no more than two of whom may be from the same political party; and (3) Three members appointed by the Governor. Section 23. That the code be amended by adding a NEW SECTION to read: There is hereby created the School Finance Accountability Board within the Department of Education. The board shall consist of five members appointed by the Governor. The members shall serve a term of four years. The board may recommend that the provisions of section 24 of this Act be waived for a school district if the district can demonstrate that its lowest monthly general cash fund cash balance percentage is the result of special circumstances. The board may recommend that a penalty against a school district imposed under section 27 of this Act be waived, in whole or in part, if the district can demonstrate that its failure to comply with section 27 of this Act is due to special circumstances. The School Finance Accountability Board shall promulgate rules pursuant to chapter 1-26 to establish the appeals process provided for in section 27 of this Act, and to establish the factors that may be considered in considering a waiver requested by a school district, which shall include the impact of retirements. Any waivers of sections 24 or 27 of this Act recommended by the School Finance Accountability Board must be approved by the Joint Committee on Appropriations or the Interim Committee on Appropriations. The Department of Education shall annually report to the Governor and the Legislature the information collected pursuant to \u00a7 13-8-47 and section 27 of this Act. Section 24. That the code be amended by adding a NEW SECTION to read: Beginning on July 1, 2018, a school district's state aid for general education as calculated pursuant to \u00a7 13-13-73 shall be reduced by subtracting the allowable general fund cash balance from the lowest general fund monthly cash balance. If the result is less than zero, the reduction equals zero. A school district created or reorganized after July 1, 2016, is exempt from the reduction provided by this section for a period of three years immediately following its creation. Section 25. That the code be amended by adding a NEW SECTION to read: The pension fund of the school district is provided for the purpose of financing payments to the South Dakota Retirement System and to finance pensions to retired employees of a school district that has established a pension system. Upon discontinuance of the pension fund any unexpended balance shall be transferred to the general fund. This section is repealed on July 1, 2020. Section 26. That \u00a7 13-8-47 be amended to read: 13-8-47. Before the first day of August every school board shall file an annual report with the Department of Education. The report shall contain all the educational and financial information and statistics of the school district as requested in a format established by the Department of Education. The report shall also contain, for each month of the fiscal year, the month-end cash balances of the school district's general fund, capital outlay fund, pension fund, and special education fund. The report shall also contain the following information for the district from the preceding fiscal year: (1) Total teacher compensation, which is defined as the total amount spent on instructional salaries and benefits for certified instructional staff; (2) The total amount spent on instructional salaries for certified instructional staff; (3) The total amount spent on benefits for certified instructional staff; (4) The total number of certified instructional staff employed by the school district; and (5) Any other information necessary to comply with the provisions of this Act.

Reports not filed prior to August thirtieth are considered past due and are subject to the past-due provisions of \u00a7 13-13-38. Section 27. That the code be amended by adding a NEW SECTION to read: The Department of Education shall calculate the following for each school district: (1) The average teacher salary, based on data collected pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 13-8-47 and 13-3-51; (2) The increase in local need pursuant to \u00a7 13-13-10.1, excluding any effect due to change in the school district's fall enrollment and less the amount of revenue generated in school fiscal year 2016 pursuant to \u00a7 13-10-6 as a percentage increase, from fiscal year 2016 to fiscal year 2017; and (3) The increase in average teacher compensation as a percentage increase, as defined in \u00a7 13-8-47, from fiscal year 2016 to fiscal year 2017. For each school district, the district's increase in average teacher compensation from fiscal year 2016 to 2017 shall be equal to at least eighty-five percent of the district's increase in local need, as defined in subdivision (2), from fiscal year 2016 to fiscal year 2017 and, notwithstanding any negotiated agreement, at least eighty-five percent of the increase in state aid to general education funding the school district receives for fiscal year 2017 less the amount of revenue generated in fiscal year 2016 pursuant to \u00a7 13-10-6 shall be used to increase instructional salaries and benefits for certified instructional staff. If a district fails to comply with the requirements of this section, state aid to general education funding to the district in fiscal year 2018 shall be decreased by an amount equal to fifty percent of the amount calculated in subdivision (2). For fiscal years 2019, 2020, and 2021, if a district's average teacher compensation is less than the district's average teacher compensation in fiscal year 2017, state aid to general education funding to the district in the following fiscal year shall be reduced by an amount equal to five hundred dollars for each teacher employed in the school district. A school district may request a waiver from any penalty imposed under this section from the School Finance Accountability Board. Section 28. That the code be amended by adding a NEW SECTION to read: It is the intent of the Legislature that any money appropriated for teacher compensation using the education funding plan included in this Act be used to directly improve teacher recruiting and retention and that the school districts advance this goal by increasing starting teacher salaries and providing for the rapid acceleration of teacher salaries for those below the midpoint in that teacher's applicable pay scale."}, {"bill_id": 7490, "bill_version_id": 40552, "bill_version": "Enrolled", "bill_version_date":
