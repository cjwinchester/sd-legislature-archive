BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 32-23-2 be amended to read as follows: 32-23-2. If conviction for a violation of \u00a7 32-23-1 is for a first offense, such person is guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor, and the defendant's driving privileges shall be revoked for not less than thirty days. However, the court may in its discretion issue an order upon proof of financial responsibility, pursuant to \u00a7 32-35-113, permitting the person to operate a vehicle for purposes of employment, 24/7 sobriety testing, attendance at school, or attendance at counseling programs. The court may also order the revocation of the defendant's driving privilege for a further period not to exceed one year or restrict the privilege in such manner as it sees fit for a period not to exceed one year. Section 2. That \u00a7 32-23-3 be amended to read as follows: 32-23-3. If conviction for a violation of \u00a7 32-23-1 is for a second offense, such person is guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor, and the court shall, in pronouncing sentence, unconditionally revoke the defendant's driving privilege for a period of not less than one year. However, upon the successful completion of a court-approved chemical dependency program, and proof of financial responsibility pursuant to \u00a7 32-35-113, the court may permit the person to drive for the purposes of employment, 24/7 sobriety testing, attendance at school, or attendance at counseling programs. If such person is convicted of driving without a license during that period, the person shall be sentenced to the county jail for not less than three days, which sentence may not be suspended. Section 3. That \u00a7 32-23-4 be amended to read as follows: 32-23-4. If conviction for a violation of \u00a7 32-23-1 is for a third offense, the person is guilty of a Class 6 felony, and the court, in pronouncing sentence, shall order that the driver's license of any person so convicted be revoked for a period of not less than one year from the date sentence is imposed or one year from the date of initial release from imprisonment, whichever is later. In the event the person is returned to imprisonment prior to the completion of the period of driver's license revocation, time spent imprisoned does not count toward fulfilling the period of revocation. If the person is convicted of driving without a license during that period, he shall be sentenced to the county jail for not less than ten days, which sentence may not be suspended. Notwithstanding \u00a7 23A-27-19, the court retains jurisdiction to modify the conditions of the license revocation for the term of such revocation. Upon the successful completion of a court- approved chemical dependency counseling program, and proof of financial responsibility pursuant to \u00a7 32-35-113, the court may permit the person to operate a vehicle for the purposes of employment, 24/7 sobriety testing, attendance at school, or attendance at counseling programs. Section 4. That \u00a7 32-23-4.6 be amended to read as follows: 32-23-4.6. If conviction for a violation of \u00a7 32-23-1 is for a fourth offense and the person has previously been convicted of a felony under \u00a7 32-23-4, the person is guilty of a Class 5 felony, and the court, in pronouncing sentence, shall order that the driver's license of any person so convicted be revoked for a period of not less than two years from the date sentence is imposed or two years from the date of initial release from imprisonment, whichever is later. In the event the person is returned to imprisonment prior to the completion of the period of driver's license revocation, time spent imprisoned does not count toward fulfilling the period of revocation. If the person is convicted of driving without a license during that period, the person shall be sentenced to the county jail for not less than twenty days, which sentence may not be suspended. Notwithstanding \u00a7 23A-27-19, the court retains jurisdiction to modify the conditions of the license revocation for the term of such revocation. Upon the successful completion of a court- approved chemical dependency counseling program, and proof of financial responsibility pursuant to \u00a7 32-35-113, the court may permit the person to operate a vehicle for the purposes of employment, 24/7 sobriety testing, attendance at school, or attendance at counseling programs. Section 5. That \u00a7 32-23-4.7 be amended to read as follows: 32-23-4.7. If conviction for violation of \u00a7 32-23-1 is for a fifth offense, or subsequent offenses thereafter, and the person has previously been convicted of a felony under \u00a7 32-23-4, the person is guilty of a Class 4 felony and the court, in pronouncing sentencing, shall order that the driver's license of any person so convicted be revoked for a period of not less than three years from the date sentence is imposed or three years from the date of initial release from imprisonment, whichever is later. In the event the person is returned to imprisonment prior to the completion of the period of driver's license revocation, time spent imprisoned does not count toward fulfilling the period of revocation. If the person is convicted of driving without a license during that period, the person shall be sentenced to the county jail for not less than twenty days, which sentence may not be suspended. Notwithstanding \u00a7 23A-27-19, the court retains jurisdiction to modify the conditions of the license revocation for the term of such revocation. Upon the successful completion of a court- approved chemical dependency counseling program, and proof of financial responsibility pursuant to \u00a7 32-35-113, the court may permit the person to operate a vehicle for the purposes of employment, 24/7 sobriety testing, attendance at school, or attendance at counseling programs.
