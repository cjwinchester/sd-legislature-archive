WHEREAS, expenditures for campaigns for federal candidates have been rising each election year; and WHEREAS, in the 1996 elections, federal candidates accepted and solicited campaign donations from foreign nationals and foreign governments, which is in clear violation of current federal election law; and WHEREAS, the continued abuse of federal campaign election laws tarnishes the idea of ethical fair government and helps fuel voter apathy; and WHEREAS, the United States Supreme Court has ruled that political contributions represent a form of free speech and as such are guaranteed by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution; and WHEREAS, the preservation of a United States citizen's right to criticize those who govern us and our governing institutions through political donations should not be infringed upon by any level of government; and WHEREAS, the Congress should pass meaningful campaign finance reform to help restore voter confidence in our federal process: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the House of Representatives of the Seventy- third Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the Senate concurring therein, that the Congress of the United States is urged to pass campaign election finance reform which should encompass the following principles: (1) There should be full and prompt disclosure of any type of political donations made to an individual candidate, an individual's election committee, or the candidate's political action committee in such a time prior to the general election so that a voter will know who is supporting a particular candidate; (2) Political contributions are and should remain constitutionally protected forms of free speech; (3) No member of a union or stockholder or employee of a business should be forced to give compulsory contributions as part of their dues or paychecks without first providing annual detailed written permission; and (4) Contributions from foreign governments and foreign nationals must be guarded against to ensure that current federal election laws are not violated; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Attorney General and the Department of Justice and its investigatory organs aggressively and impartially investigate allegations that federal candidates violated election laws during the 1996 elections, such as receiving money from foreign governments or foreign nationals, and soliciting campaign contributions while on federal property; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Federal Elections Commission should increase its efforts to ensure that all candidates comply with existing federal campaign election laws and aggressively prosecute any candidate who violates these laws.
