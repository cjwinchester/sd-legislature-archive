WHEREAS, the 1985 Farm Bill with the Swampbuster Act Provision was national policy for all fifty states of the United States; and WHEREAS, the South Dakota Natural Resource Conservation Service made its own separate set of rules regarding wetland determinations in 1985 using the rationale that South Dakota is unique because of its location in the prairie pothole region; and WHEREAS, the fact is that the prairie pothole region of North America includes large portions of Iowa, Minnesota, North Dakota, and South Dakota, and these four states all have similar if not identical wetland characteristics; and WHEREAS, the South Dakota Natural Resource Conservation Service finally admitted that it was out of compliance with the 1985 Swampbuster Act and made procedural adjustments for making wetland determinations, which were approved by the National Natural Resource Conservation Service in August of 1999; and WHEREAS, the National Natural Resource Conservation Service then made an out-of-court settlement agreement in January 2000 with the National Wildlife Federation and other groups which nullified the procedural adjustments adopted by the South Dakota Natural Resource Conservation Service in August 1999; and WHEREAS, the South Dakota Natural Resource Conservation Service and the South Dakota farm producers had no input into the provisions of the settlement agreement. However, South Dakota farm producers are directly affected by the results, and they are unable to negotiate on their own behalf; and WHEREAS, South Dakota farm producers are good stewards of their land and water resources and understand the need to protect true wetlands and the need to protect wildlife: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the House of Representatives of the Seventy- fifth Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the Senate concurring therein, that the Legislature of the State of South Dakota: (1) Supports efforts by the South Dakota Natural Resource Conservation Service to follow national policy for making wetland determinations in compliance with the 1985 Farm Bill Swampbuster Act; (2) Supports efforts by South Dakota farm producers to be treated fairly and equitably by the Natural Resource Conservation Service, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, and other state and federal agencies on wetlands issues; and (3) Supports efforts by South Dakota farm producers to demonstrate sound soil and water management practices that reduce erosion, protect water quality, and provide friendly wildlife habitat."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 15800, "action_date": "2000-02-18T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 85966, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/85966.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 651, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 15800, "action_date": "2000-02-18T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 85966, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/85966.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to 36th legislative day", "journal_page": 749, "committee_id_action": 651, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 44720, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [2313, 2333, 2337, 2345, 2351, 2353, 2360, 2363, 2368, 2388, 2393, 2372, 2319]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/15800"}
