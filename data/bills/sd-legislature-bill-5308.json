WHEREAS, school districts across the state, and especially those in remote, rural areas, sometimes lack the staff and resources needed to provide students with the course offerings, co-curricular activities, or other educational services or opportunities that are necessary or would serve to enhance the students' learning and educational experiences; and WHEREAS, by working together, school districts can overcome many of the challenges they face by sharing programs, equipment and other resources, and staff, including administrators, teachers, and counselors; and WHEREAS, the use of technology in recent years has allowed school districts to share curriculum, teachers, and programs much more efficiently and effectively by taking away many of the costs and geographic barriers that once prevented such collaboration; and WHEREAS, these cooperative efforts among school districts not only benefit students, but they also benefit the entire communities in which the students live, and all the state's citizens: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the House of Representatives of the Eighty-Ninth Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the Senate concurring therein, that the South Dakota Legislature supports and appreciates all the collaboration that is already taking place among the state's school districts, and encourages further cooperative efforts to provide all the state's students with the best educational opportunities possible."}, {"bill_id": 5308, "bill_version_id": 28751, "bill_version": "Enrolled", "bill_version_date": "2014-01-22T10:08:40.91-06:00", "bill_text": ""}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 5308, "action_date": "2014-01-14T12:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 28475, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/28475.pdf", "status_text": "First Reading", "journal_page": 11, "committee_id_action": 231, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 5308, "action_date": "2014-01-15T13:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 28502, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/28502.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to another day", "journal_page": 37, "committee_id_action": 231, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 5308, "action_date": "2014-01-16T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 28553, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/28553.pdf", "status_text": "Adopt Resolution", "journal_page": 42, "committee_id_action": 231, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 15019, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [528, 527, 453, 522, 525, 433, 467, 524, 456, 517, 519, 505, 449, 431, 455, 425, 504, 481, 509, 503, 477, 501, 520, 479, 457, 454, 523, 496, 451, 466, 845, 499, 442, 476, 521, 507, 478, 487, 423, 439, 500, 502, 497, 515, 511, 512, 463, 518, 484, 462, 485, 514, 459, 464, 510, 450, 506, 430, 513, 468, 498, 461, 516, 508, 480, 460, 448, 441], "Excused": [489, 458]}}, {"bill_id": 5308, "action_date": "2014-01-17T13:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 28597, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/28597.pdf", "status_text": "First Reading", "journal_page": 80, "committee_id_action": 229, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 5308, "action_date": "2014-01-21T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 28714, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/28714.pdf", "status_text": "Concurred in Resolution", "journal_page": 84, "committee_id_action": 229, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 15048, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [469, 437, 444, 473, 846, 495, 447, 472, 470, 432, 465, 847, 483, 443, 429, 452, 436, 438, 526, 491, 428, 475, 435, 440, 493, 849, 426, 446, 494, 434, 490, 486], "Nay": [424, 492], "Excused": [474]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/5308"}
