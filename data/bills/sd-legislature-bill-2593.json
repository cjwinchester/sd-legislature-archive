No person may engage in the business of applying pesticides to the lands of another, advertise as being in the business of applying pesticides to the lands of another at any time, apply pesticides while in the performance of duties as a governmental employee or otherwise act as a commercial applicator without an applicator's license issued by the secretary of agriculture, unless exempted under the provisions of this chapter. A seasonal employee who does not have an applicator license may apply pesticides to the lands of another if the employee is under the direct supervision of a person who has an applicator license. For the purposes of this section, the term, seasonal employee, is any person who applies pesticides for less than three months per year. The secretary shall require a fee of twenty-five dollars for each applicator license issued. The secretary of agriculture shall issue an applicator license to government employees without a license fee. The fee exempt license is valid only when the applicator is applying pesticides in the course of employment for the governmental entity. Any person who violates this section is subject to a civil penalty not to exceed five thousand dollars per violation."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 2593, "action_date": "2011-01-24T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 15453, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/15453.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 149, "committee_id_action": 115, "committee_id_assigned": 116, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 2593, "action_date": "2011-02-15T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 16729, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/16729.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 116, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 2593, "action_date": "2011-02-15T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 16872, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/16872.pdf", "status_text": "Motion to amend", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 116, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 2593, "action_date": "2011-02-15T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 16872, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/16872.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass Amended", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 116, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "F", "vote": {"vote_id": 9020, "president_vote": null, "Excused": [33, 71], "Nay": [61, 99, 73, 6, 29], "Yea": [20, 103, 32, 64, 97, 66]}}, {"bill_id": 2593, "action_date": "2011-02-17T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 16912, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/16912.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 116, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 2593, "action_date": "2011-02-17T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 17044, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/17044.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to the 41st legislative day", "journal_page": 438, "committee_id_action": 116, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 9187, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [33, 61, 71, 99, 73, 6, 29], "Nay": [20, 103, 32, 64, 97, 66]}}]}
