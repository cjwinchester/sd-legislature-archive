WHEREAS, the nation continues to face serious problems providing sources of affordable energy; and WHEREAS, one promising source of energy is wind; and WHEREAS, wind turbines are now available in sizes and prices appropriate for residences; and WHEREAS, a growing number of homeowners are choosing to purchase and erect such turbines; and WHEREAS, county ordinances in some cases are unduly restrictive with respect to residential structures; and WHEREAS, some homeowners associations' covenants or restrictions may prohibit the erection of residential wind turbines: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the Senate of the Eighty-fourth Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the House of Representatives concurring therein, that the Legislature encourages counties and other local governments to be as lenient as possible in their residential wind turbine-related ordinances and to write their ordinances so as to allow erection of wind turbines on small parcels of land if the engineering design of the turbine support structure ensures that the structure can survive a 150-year wind event; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Legislature encourages local governments to write their ordinances so that any residential property subject to covenants or other restrictions is exempt from any such restrictions that apply to the erection of residential wind turbines."}, {"bill_id": 1297, "bill_version_id": 8169, "bill_version": "Enrolled", "bill_version_date": "2009-02-25T09:39:20.83-06:00", "bill_text": ""}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 1297, "action_date": "2009-02-19T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 7819, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/7819.pdf", "status_text": "First Reading", "journal_page": 463, "committee_id_action": 54, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 1297, "action_date": "2009-02-20T13:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 7946, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/7946.pdf", "status_text": "Adopt Resolution", "journal_page": 485, "committee_id_action": 54, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 4436, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [653, 680, 675, 697, 659, 636, 656, 669, 701, 662, 638, 648, 640, 705, 642, 671], "Yea": [704, 682, 685, 702, 649, 700, 655, 673, 677, 634, 690, 667, 661, 686, 703, 664, 689, 694], "Excused": [663]}}, {"bill_id": 1297, "action_date": "2009-02-23T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 8030, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/8030.pdf", "status_text": "First Reading", "journal_page": 488, "committee_id_action": 56, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 1297, "action_date": "2009-02-24T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 8136, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/8136.pdf", "status_text": "Concurred in Resolution", "journal_page": 516, "committee_id_action": 56, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 4602, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [716, 720, 666, 688, 670, 726, 715, 699, 674, 635, 692, 708, 712, 709, 660, 706, 725, 693, 644, 724, 727, 652, 730, 737, 672, 698, 738, 654, 711, 719, 695, 696, 722, 637, 687, 678, 650, 646, 668, 639, 735, 679, 734, 714, 731, 736, 713, 710, 728, 657, 658, 647, 691, 723, 684, 732, 707, 681], "Nay": [676, 651, 643, 721, 729, 717, 683, 645, 665, 641, 718, 733]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/1297"}
