BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 41-8-17 be amended to read as follows: 41-8-17. During the time from sunset to sunrise, no person may use or possess night-vision equipment or throw or cast the rays of a spotlight, headlight, or other artificial light on any highway, or in any field, pasture, woodland, forest, or prairie, for the purpose of spotting, locating, or taking or attempting to take or hunt any animal while having in possession or control any firearm, bow or other implement whereby any game could be killed. However: (1) A person may use a hand held light while on foot, to take raccoons after they have been treed by dogs; (2) A landowner or occupant and one guest accompanied by the landowner or occupant may use an artificial light on the owner's or occupant's land, with a shotgun using shot shells only or a firearm using a .22 caliber rimfire cartridge, in the taking of jackrabbits, coyotes, beaver during its hunting season, foxes, raccoons, opossums, badgers, skunks, or rodents; and (3) Any person employed by the Department of Game, Fish and Parks performing animal damage control may use night-vision equipment and artificial lights in the performance of the person's duty. In the taking of animals causing damage the employee shall obtain permission from the owner or lessee of such land; and (4) Any person who meets the requirements of section 2 of this Act may use artificial light in the taking of coyotes. For the purposes of this section, night-vision equipment is an optical device utilizing light amplifying circuits that are electrical or battery powered. The provisions of this section do not apply to a law enforcement officer in the performance of the officer's duty. A violation of this section is a Class 2 misdemeanor. Section 2. That chapter 41-8 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Any person who is sixteen years of age or older and who is licensed or authorized under this Title to take coyotes by hunting may use artificial light in the taking of coyotes by hunting if the person has a permit issued pursuant to this section. A person using artificial light to take coyotes under this section may use any firearm that may otherwise be used to take coyotes. The Game, Fish and Parks Commission shall promulgate rules pursuant to chapter 1-26 to provide for the issuance of permits to authorize the use of artificial light in taking coyotes as provided in this section. The rules may require a fee not to exceed twenty dollars for each permit to be issued. The rules may include restrictions on the use of artificial light during specified big game hunting seasons and may regulate the types of artificial lights to be used, the number of persons in the hunting party, and hunting methods and practices as necessary to protect public safety."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 165, "action_date": "2013-01-23T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 24441, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/24441.pdf", "status_text": "First read in Senate and referred to", "journal_page": 172, "committee_id_action": 200, "committee_id_assigned": 176, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 165, "action_date": "2013-02-05T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 25092, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/25092.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 176, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 165, "action_date": "2013-02-05T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 25265, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/25265.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass", "journal_page": 322, "committee_id_action": 176, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 13414, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [388, 340, 322, 329, 384, 368, 333], "Nay": [385, 327]}}, {"bill_id": 165, "action_date": "2013-02-06T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 25380, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/25380.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass", "journal_page": 348, "committee_id_action": 200, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "F", "vote": {"vote_id": 13524, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [338, 362, 330, 337, 388, 365, 363, 325, 358, 364, 376, 336, 317, 385, 384, 321, 386, 319, 339, 387, 327, 379], "Yea": [366, 340, 322, 345, 329, 331, 419, 320, 368, 328, 333, 367, 383]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/165"}
