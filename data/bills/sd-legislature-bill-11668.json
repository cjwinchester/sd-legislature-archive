Notwithstanding \u00a7 10-6-33.7, soil classes I through III shall be categorized as crop and classes V through VIII shall be categorized as noncrop. The director of equalization shall determine the class IV soils for agricultural land for the 2023 assessment year with taxes due and payable in 2024. The director of equalization shall determine which crop category the class IV soils shall be based, without regard to management, if sixty percent or more of the soil use cover is devoted to the harvesting of crops. The director of equalization shall determine which crop category the class IV soils shall be based, without regard to management, if sixty percent or more of the soil has very severe limitations that restrict the choice of plants and the vegetation cover is not devoted to the harvesting of crops. Nothing in the section prohibits the director of equalization from making the determination of the highest and best use of the land on a per parcel basis without regard to management.
