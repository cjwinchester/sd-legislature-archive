Section 5. That chapter 58-33A be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Prior to the execution of a purchase or exchange of an annuity resulting from a recommendation, an insurance producer, or an insurer if no producer is involved, shall make reasonable efforts to obtain information concerning: (1) The consumer's financial status; (2) The consumer's tax status; (3) The consumer's investment objectives; and (4) Such other information used or considered to be reasonable by the insurance producer, or the insurer if no producer is involved, in making any recommendation to the consumer.

An insurer may comply with its obligation to make reasonable inquiry by doing all of the following: (1) The insurer annually obtains a certification from a third party senior manager who has responsibility for the delegated functions that the manager has a reasonable basis to represent, and does represent, that the third party is performing the required functions; and (2) The insurer, based on reasonable selection criteria, periodically selects third parties contracting under this section for a review to determine whether the third parties are performing the required functions. The insurer shall perform those procedures to conduct the review that are reasonable under the circumstances. Any insurer that contracts with a third party pursuant to this section and that complies with the requirements to supervise in this section has fulfilled its responsibilities under section 8 of this Act.

Section 14. That chapter 58-33A be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: The director may order: (1) An insurer to take reasonably appropriate corrective action for any consumer harmed by the insurer's, or by its insurance producer's, violation of this Act; (2) An insurance producer to take reasonably appropriate corrective action for any consumer harmed by the insurance producer's violation of this Act; and (3) A general agency or independent agency that employs or contracts with an insurance producer to sell, or solicit the sale, of annuities to consumers, to take reasonably appropriate corrective action for any consumer harmed by the insurance producer's violation of this Act. Any violation of sections 4, 5, or 7 of this Act subjects the insurer, insurance producer, or general agency or independent agency to suspension, revocation, refusal to renew a license, or to a monetary penalty as provided for under this title. However, the penalty may be reduced or eliminated, according to a schedule adopted by the director, if corrective action for the consumer is taken promptly after a violation is discovered.
