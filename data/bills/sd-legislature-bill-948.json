WHEREAS, in 1935, the United States established, by law, that workers must be free to form unions; and WHEREAS, the freedom to form or join a union is internationally recognized by the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights as a fundamental human right; and WHEREAS, the free choice to join with others and bargain for better wages and benefits is essential to economic opportunity and good living standards; and WHEREAS, unions benefit communities by strengthening living standards, stabilizing tax bases, promoting equal treatment, and enhancing civic participation; and WHEREAS, states in which more people are union members are states with higher wages, better benefits, and better schools; and WHEREAS, unions help raise workers' pay and narrow the income gap for minorities and women, increasing median weekly earnings thirty-one percent for union women workers, thirty- six percent for African American workers, forty-six percent for Latino workers, and eight percent for Asian American workers; and WHEREAS, union workers are more likely to have health coverage and guaranteed defined- benefit pensions (eighty percent of private-sector union workers have employer-provided health insurance, compared with only forty-nine percent of nonunion workers, and sixty-eight percent of union workers have defined-benefit pension plans, compared with fourteen percent of nonunion workers); and WHEREAS, workers across the nation are routinely denied the freedom to form unions and to bargain for a better life with twenty-five percent of private-sector employers illegally firing at least one worker for union activity; and WHEREAS, employers often refuse to bargain fairly after workers form a union by dragging out first contract bargaining for up to two years in forty-five percent of successful campaigns; and WHEREAS, each year millions of dollars are spent to frustrate workers' efforts to form unions and ninety-two percent of private-sector employers force employees to attend mandatory anti-union meetings; and WHEREAS, when the right of workers to form a union is violated, wages fall, race and gender pay gaps widen, workplace discrimination increases, and job safety standards disappear; and WHEREAS, a worker's fundamental right to choose a union free from coercion and intimidation is a public issue that requires public policy solutions, including legislative remedies; and WHEREAS, the Employee Free Choice Act received majority support in both houses of Congress in 2007 but was defeated by a minority of Senators; and WHEREAS, the Employee Free Choice Act will safeguard workers' abilities to make their own decisions about forming a union, provide for first contract mediation and arbitration, and establish meaningful penalties when employers violate workers' rights: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the House of Representatives of the Eighty- fourth Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the Senate concurring therein, that the Legislature supports the Employee Free Choice Act, which would authorize the National Labor Relations Board to certify a union as the bargaining representative when a majority of employees voluntarily signs authorization cards designating that union to represent them; to provide for first contract mediation and arbitration; and to establish meaningful penalties for violations of a worker's freedom to choose a union; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Legislature urge Congress to pass the Employee Free Choice Act to protect and preserve for America's workers their freedom to choose for themselves whether or not to form a union."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 948, "action_date": "2009-02-03T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 6759, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/6759.pdf", "status_text": "First read and referred to", "journal_page": 263, "committee_id_action": 56, "committee_id_assigned": 42, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 948, "action_date": "2009-02-23T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 7865, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/7865.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 42, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 948, "action_date": "2009-02-23T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 8003, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/8003.pdf", "status_text": "Tabled", "journal_page": 481, "committee_id_action": 42, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 4496, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [716, 717, 665, 713], "Yea": [692, 712, 644, 737, 654, 637, 646, 710, 679]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/948"}
