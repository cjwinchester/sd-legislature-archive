Any voter in the active registration file who has failed to vote, has not updated the voter's registration information, and has not replied to a confirmation mailing at least once during the last preceding four consecutive years shall be sent a nonforwardable return-if-undeliverable address verification request. If the request is undeliverable then a confirmation mailing prescribed by the State Board of Elections shall be sent. If a county auditor has determined through a national change of address licensee of the United States Postal Service that the address of a voter who is to be sent an address verification request has changed, that the confirmation mailing may be omitted. This process shall be performed by each county auditor between from January first and to November fifteenth, inclusive, of each odd-numbered year. Section 2. That chapter 12-4 be amended by adding a NEW SECTION to read: The national change of address notice shall be sent by forwarding service requested to each voter in the active registration file who has failed to vote, has not updated the voter's registration information, has not replied to a confirmation mailing at least once during the last preceding four consecutive years, and has had a national change of address within the jurisdiction with the United States Post Office. This process shall be performed by each county auditor from January first to November fifteenth, inclusive, of each odd-numbered year. Section 3. That chapter 12-4 be amended by adding a NEW SECTION to read: The voter registration list maintenance confirmation mailing notice shall be a double postcard stating that the voter's registration may be canceled if the card is not returned. In addition, the card shall state that if the information on the return card is correct, the voter shall sign and return the card by the voter registration deadline of the primary election or the voter's registration becomes inactive. The card shall also state that if the information on the return card is not correct, the voter shall send the correct information to update the voter's registration or the voter's registration becomes inactive. If the card is returned indicating a new address in another county in South Dakota or another state, the card shall serve as a cancellation authorization. The card shall also give information on reregistering if the voter has moved to another county or state. The card shall give the information about the voter as the information appears in the registration records."}, {"bill_id": 8689, "bill_version_id": 48120, "bill_version": "Enrolled",
