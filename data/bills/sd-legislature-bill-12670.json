Section 3. A written prize notice shall contain all of the following information: (1) The true name, address, and telephone number of the solicitor and sponsor; (2) The verifiable retail value of each prize the individual has been selected or may be eligible to receive; (3) If the notice lists more than one prize that the individual has won or will receive, a statement of the odds the individual has of receiving each prize; (4) Any requirement or invitation for the individual to view, hear, or attend a sales presentation in order to claim a prize, the approximate length of the sales presentation, and a description of the property or service that is the subject of the sales presentation; (5) Any requirement that the individual pay shipping or handling fees or any other charges to obtain or use a prize; (6) If receipt of the prize is subject to a restriction, a statement that a restriction applies, a description of the restriction, and a statement containing the location in the notice where the restriction is described; (7) Any limitations on eligibility; and (8) If the individual is invited or required to telephone the solicitor or sponsor to enter or claim a prize, a statement disclosing the average length of such a call, any toll charges beyond normal long distance charges that the individual has to pay, and any other methods available to the individual to enter or claim a prize. Section 4. The verifiable retail value and the statement of odds required in a written prize notice shall be stated in immediate proximity to each listing of the prize in each place the prize appears on the written prize notice and shall be in the same size and boldness of type as the prize. The statement of odds shall include, for each prize, the total number of prizes to be given away and the total number of written prize notices to be delivered. The number of prizes and written prize notices shall be stated in Arabic numerals. The statement of odds shall be in the following form: \"___ (number of prizes) out of ___ written prize notices.\" The verifiable retail value shall be in the following form: \"verifiable retail value: $___.\" Section 5.

The information required in a written prize notice under subdivision 4 of section 3 of this Act shall be on the first page of the written prize notice in not less than 12-point boldface type. The information required by subdivisions (6), (7), and (8) of section 3 of this Act may not be in less than 12-point boldface type. Section 7. If a written prize notice is given by a solicitor on behalf of a sponsor, the name of the sponsor shall be prominently and conspicuously displayed. Section 8. A solicitor or sponsor may not do any of the following: (1) Place on an envelope containing a written prize notice any representation that the person to whom the envelope is addressed has won or will receive a prize; (2) Deliver a written prize notice that contains language, or is designed in a manner, that would lead a reasonable person to believe that it originates from a government agency, public utility, insurance company, consumer reporting agency, debt collector, or law firm unless the written prize notice originates from that source; or (3) Represent directly or by implication that the number of individuals eligible for the prize is limited or that an individual has won or will receive a particular prize unless the representation is true. Section 9. If a prize notice requires or invites an individual to view, hear, or attend a sales presentation in order to claim a prize, the sales presentation may not begin until the solicitor does all of the following: (1) Informs the individual of the prize, if any, that has been awarded to the individual; and (2) If the individual has been awarded a prize, delivers to the individual the prize or the item selected by the individual pursuant to section 10 of this Act if the prize is not available. Section 10. A solicitor who represents to an individual in a written prize notice that the individual has won or will receive a prize shall provide the prize to the individual unless the prize is not available. If the prize is not available, the solicitor shall provide the individual with any one of the following items selected by the individual: (1) Any other prize listed in the written prize notice that is available and that is of equal or greater value; (2) The verifiable retail value of the prize in the form of cash, a money order, or a certified check; or (3) A voucher, certificate, or other evidence of obligation stating that the prize will be shipped to the individual within thirty days at no cost to the individual. If a voucher, certificate, or other evidence of obligation delivered pursuant to subdivision (3) is not honored within thirty days, the solicitor shall deliver the verifiable retail value of the prize in the form of cash, a money order, or a certified check. The sponsor shall make the payment to the individual if the solicitor fails to do so. Section 11. If the attorney general or a state's attorney, has reason to believe that any person has violated this Act, the attorney general or state's attorney may bring an action in the name of the state against such person to restrain by temporary or permanent injunction the use of such act or practice. Section 12. The attorney general or a state's attorney, upon petition to the court, may recover on behalf of the state, a civil penalty of at least one hundred dollars and not more than five thousand dollars per violation from any person who violates the terms of an injunction issued under section 11 of this Act. Section 13. In any action brought under section 11 of this Act, if the court finds that a solicitor or sponsor intentionally used an act or practice declared to be unlawful by this Act, the attorney general or state's attorney, upon petition to the court, may recover, on behalf of the state, a civil penalty of not more than two thousand dollars per violation. For purposes of this section, an intentional violation occurs when the party committing the violation knew or should have known that the conduct was a violation of this Act. Section 14. Any individual who claims to have been adversely affected by any act or practice declared to be unlawful by this Act may bring a civil action for the recovery of twice the actual damages suffered or five hundred dollars, whichever is greater, as a result of such act or practice. In addition, the individual may collect the court costs and attorney fees expended to bring an action under this section. Section 15. An action under this Act shall be tried in the circuit court for the county in which the alleged violator resides or, if the action is brought by the Attorney General on behalf of the State, has its place of business, in the circuit court of the county where the victim resides, or in the circuit court for Hughes County, South Dakota, at the election of the plaintiff. Section 16. Any action arising under this Act in no way affects any cause of action arising under other laws of this state or under the common law, whether or not the other cause of action is included within the provisions of this Act. Section 17. Any person who knowingly or intentionally violates this Act with the intent to defraud a consumer is guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor. Section 18.
