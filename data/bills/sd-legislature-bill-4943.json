BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 13-42-27 be amended to read as follows: 13-42-27. Pursuant to \u00a7 13-1-12.1, the Board of Education shall examine programs that prepare and certify school personnel, identify deficiencies, and establish revised standards designed to deliver more qualified staff to classrooms. The board's review shall identify ways to streamline the alternative certification process whereby persons holding a bachelor's degree or higher can be certified to teach in elementary and secondary schools. The board shall also establish revised standards for the alternative certification of career and technical education teachers to allow persons highly skilled in a particular area to teach in that particular area in accredited schools in the state on more than a provisional basis without having to complete education course work in pedagogy and other related fields. 250 copies of this document were printed by the South Dakota Legislative Research Council at a cost of $.04 per page. .
