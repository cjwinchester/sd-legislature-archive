WHEREAS, mandatory commodity checkoffs taken from farmers to fund commodity organizations have weakened the family farm economically and politically while serving to advance the interests of corporate industrial agriculture; and WHEREAS, commodity organizations receiving the mandatory checkoff taxes have usurped the voice of the family farmer in the halls of Congress, the USDA, and state government. These organizations have weakened the powers of local units of government and promoted packer ownership of swine and the continuation of the mandatory checkoff taxes themselves: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the House of Representatives of the Seventy- sixth Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the Senate concurring therein, that national referenda of producers be held on the termination of each and every mandatory checkoff program at the soonest possible date, and no later than August 2002, starting with the beef checkoff referendum; and that Congressional and White House policy makers be advised that family farmers must be represented in strength in all Farm Bill negotiations, at least equal in number to the representation of commodity organizations."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 16376, "action_date": "2001-02-20T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 90359, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/90359.pdf", "status_text": "Adopt Resolution", "journal_page": 594, "committee_id_action": 712, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "F", "vote": {"vote_id": 51586, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [2514, 2515, 2522, 2525, 2526, 2528, 2533, 2537, 2538, 2544, 2545, 2546, 2553, 2556, 2557, 2558, 2559, 2561, 2563, 2564, 2565, 2566, 2570, 2571, 2572, 2575, 2577, 2578, 2579, 2582, 2583, 2586, 2588, 2592, 2593, 2595, 2596, 2600, 2601, 2603, 2604, 2605, 2608, 2610, 2612, 2613, 2618, 2540], "Yea": [2518, 2519, 2521, 2527, 2541, 2543, 2547, 2548, 2554, 2560, 2568, 2574, 2587, 2589, 2591, 2599, 2602, 2611, 2614], "Absent": [2530, 2555, 2594]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/16376"}
