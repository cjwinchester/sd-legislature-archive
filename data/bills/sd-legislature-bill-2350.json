Section 2. That \u00a7 10-62-2 be amended to read as follows: 10-62-2. There is hereby imposed a tax of five and one-half percent on the net revenues of each intermediate care facility for the mentally retarded persons with intellectual disabilities. Section 3. That \u00a7 13-32-13 be amended to read as follows: 13-32-13. The provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 13-32-10 to 13-32-12, inclusive, do not apply to any of the following group living environments: (1) A facility operated by the Department of Corrections; (2) A facility operated by the Department of Human Services; (3) A group care or residential treatment facility licensed by the Department of Social Services; (4) A residential treatment facility accredited by the Department of Human Services; (5) A community support provider as defined in \u00a7 27B-1-17; (6) An intermediate care facility for the mentally retarded persons with intellectual disabilities; (7) A juvenile detention center or holding facility operated by a county; or (8) A hospital or health care facility as defined in \u00a7 34-12-1.1. Section 4. That subdivision (2) of \u00a7 22-46-1 be amended to read as follows: (2) \"Disabled adult,\" a person eighteen years of age or older who suffers from a condition of mental retardation intellectual disability, infirmities of aging as manifested by organic brain damage, advanced age, or other physical dysfunctioning to the extent that the person is unable to protect himself or herself or provide for his or her own care; Section 5. That \u00a7 23A-27A-26.1 be amended to read as follows: 23A-27A-26.1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the death penalty may not be imposed upon any person who was mentally retarded had an intellectual disability at the time of the commission of the offense and whose mental retardation intellectual disability was manifested and documented before the age of eighteen years. Section 6. That \u00a7 23A-27A-26.2 be amended to read as follows: 23A-27A-26.2. As used in \u00a7\u00a7 23A-27A-26.1 to 23A-27A-26.7, inclusive, mental retardation intellectual disability means significant subaverage general intellectual functioning existing concurrently with substantial related deficits in applicable adaptive skill areas. An intelligence quotient exceeding seventy on a reliable standardized measure of intelligence is presumptive evidence that the defendant does not have significant subaverage general intellectual functioning. Section 7. That \u00a7 23A-27A-26.3 be amended to read as follows: 23A-27A-26.3. Not later than ninety days prior to the commencement of trial, the defendant may upon a motion alleging reasonable cause to believe the defendant was mentally retarded had an intellectual disability at the time of the commission of the offense, apply for an order directing that a mental retardation hearing be conducted prior to trial. If, upon review of the defendant's motion and any response thereto, the court finds reasonable cause to believe the defendant was mentally retarded had an intellectual disability, it shall promptly conduct a hearing without a jury to determine whether the defendant was mentally retarded had an intellectual disability. If the court finds after the hearing that the defendant was not mentally retarded did not have an intellectual disability at the time of the commission of the offense, the court shall, prior to commencement of trial, enter an order so stating, but nothing in this paragraph section precludes the defendant from presenting mitigating evidence of mental retardation an intellectual disability at the sentencing phase of the trial. If the court finds after the hearing that the defendant established mental retardation an intellectual disability by a preponderance of the evidence, the court shall prior to commencement of trial, enter an order so stating. Unless the order is reversed on appeal, a separate sentencing proceeding under this section may not be conducted if the defendant is thereafter convicted of murder in the first degree. If a separate sentencing proceeding is not conducted, the court, upon conviction of a defendant for the crime of murder in the first degree, shall sentence the defendant to life imprisonment without parole. Section 8. That \u00a7 23A-27A-26.4 be amended to read as follows: 23A-27A-26.4. If the court enters an order pursuant to \u00a7 23A-27A-26.3 finding that the defendant was mentally retarded had an intellectual disability at the time of the commission of the offense, the state may appeal as of right from the order. Upon entering such an order, the court shall afford the state a reasonable period of time, which may not be less than ten days, to determine whether to take an appeal from the order finding that the defendant was mentally retarded had an intellectual disability. The taking of an appeal by the state stays the effectiveness of the court's order and any order fixing a date for trial. Section 9. That \u00a7 23A-27A-26.5 be amended to read as follows: 23A-27A-26.5. If a defendant serves notice pursuant to \u00a7 23A-27A-26.3, the state may make application, upon notice to the defendant, for an order directing that the defendant submit to an examination by a psychiatrist, licensed psychologist, or licensed psychiatric social worker designated by the state's attorney, for the purpose of rebutting evidence offered by the defendant. Counsel for the state and the defendant have the right to be present at the examination. A videotaped recording of the examination shall be made available to the defendant and the state's attorney promptly after its conclusion. The state's attorney shall promptly serve on the defendant a written copy of the findings and evaluation of the examiner. If a defendant is subjected to an examination pursuant to an order issued in accordance with this section, any statement made by the defendant for the purpose of the examination is inadmissible in evidence against the defendant in any criminal action or proceeding on every issue other than that of whether the defendant was mentally retarded had an intellectual disability at the time of the commission of the offense, but such the statement is admissible upon such an issue whether or not it would otherwise be deemed a privileged communication. Section 10. That \u00a7 26-7A-85 be amended to read as follows: 26-7A-85. If it appears from the evidence presented at the adjudicatory hearing that the child may be mentally ill or mentally retarded has an intellectual disability, as the terms are defined in Title 27A or Title 27B, the court may suspend the adjudicatory hearing and may: (1) Order that the child be examined by a qualified mental health professional. The court may place the child in a hospital or other suitable facility for the purposes of the examination; or (2) Recommend to the state that the proceedings be conducted as provided in applicable chapters of Title 27A or Title 27B. Even if the court exercises some of the authority in this section, the court may proceed with the adjudicatory hearing and dispositional hearing. Section 11. That subdivision (18) of \u00a7 27A-1-1 be amended to read as follows: (18) \"Severe mental illness,\" substantial organic or psychiatric disorder of thought, mood, perception, orientation, or memory which significantly impairs judgment, behavior, or ability to cope with the basic demands of life. Mental retardation Intellectual disability, epilepsy, other developmental disability, alcohol or substance abuse, or brief periods of intoxication, or criminal behavior do not, alone, constitute severe mental illness.

For purposes of this section, mental retardation intellectual disability, epilepsy, other developmental disability, alcohol or substance abuse, brief period of intoxication, or criminal or delinquent behavior do not, alone, constitute serious emotional disturbance. Section 13. That subdivision (14) of \u00a7 27B-1-17 be amended to read as follows: (14) \"Qualified mental retardation developmental disabilities professional,\" any person with at least one year of experience working directly with mental retardation persons with intellectual disabilities or other developmental disabilities and is either a doctor of medicine or osteopathy, a registered nurse, or a person who holds at least a bachelor's degree in a professional category.

If the county review board issues a detention order based on a petition that did not include a recommendation for detention by a psychiatrist or psychologist, the person shall be examined by a psychiatrist or psychologist within forty-eight hours of the issuance of the detention order, excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays. The results shall be reported to the county review board.
