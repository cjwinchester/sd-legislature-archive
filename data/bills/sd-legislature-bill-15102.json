BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That chapter 10-6 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the director of equalization shall use the 2000 assessed value of property to establish the base year value for property until the 2005 assessed value is established. The 2005 assessed value shall be established through a comprehensive reassessment of all property which shall set the assessed value of each property at eighty-five percent of its market value. Each five years thereafter a new base year shall be established through a comprehensive reassessment of all property which shall set the assessed value of each property at eighty-five percent of its market value. The director of equalization shall adjust the assessed value of each property as of November first of each year by adjusting the base year value of the preceding year by the lesser of three percent or the annual percentage change in the consumer price index for urban wage earners and clerical workers as computed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, United States Department of Labor for the year prior to the year immediately preceding the year in which the property is assessed. However, the assessed value shall also be adjusted to reflect any change in use or classification plus the value of any addition, improvement, or destruction to the property that has occurred since November 1, 1999. Section 2. That chapter 10-6 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: If there is a change in use or classification or an addition, improvement, or destruction to the property, the change in use or classification or the addition, improvement, or destruction shall be assessed at eighty-five percent of its market value as of November first after the change in use or classification has occurred or the addition, improvement, or destruction is substantially completed. A change, addition, or improvement does not include the replacement of a portion of property damaged or destroyed due to misfortune or calamity, if the market value of the damaged or destroyed portion as replaced is not more than one hundred thirty-three percent of the market value of the damaged or destroyed portion of the property. The value of any replaced property that is in excess of one hundred thirty-three percent of the market value of the damaged or destroyed property is considered to be a change, addition, or improvement. The value of any replaced property with a market value of less than one hundred percent of the original property shall be assessed at its current market value. Section 3. That chapter 10-6 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: If property is destroyed or removed and not replaced, the assessed value of the property shall be reduced by the assessed value attributable to the destroyed or removed property. Section 4. That chapter 10-6 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: New property shall be assessed at eighty-five percent of its market value as of November first of the year following the classification of the property. After the property is classified and assessed, the value of the property shall be adjusted as provided in section 1 of this Act. Section 5. That chapter 10-6 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: The assessed value of the property shall be adjusted if any change, addition, or improvement is made by the owner or an owner association which directly benefits the property. Any such change, addition, or improvement shall be assessed at eighty-five percent of its market value and that market value shall be apportioned among the parcels benefiting from the improvement. Section 6. That chapter 10-6 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: If the classification of property is changed from one classification to another classification of property, the director of equalization shall appraise the property at eighty-five percent of its market value as of the date of the reclassification and the value established by the director of equalization becomes the base year value for the purpose of taxation. Section 7. That chapter 10-6 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: If any error is made in arriving at any annual assessment under this Act due to a material mistake of fact concerning an essential characteristic of the property, the assessment shall be recalculated for each year for which the error applies. Section 8. That chapter 10-6 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: If changes, additions, or improvements are not assessed at eighty-five percent of its market value as of November first after the changes, additions, or improvements were substantially completed, the director of equalization shall determine the market value for each year the changes, additions, or improvement were substantially completed. Each assessment for each subsequent year shall be corrected by applying section 1 of this Act, if applicable. If an assessment is revised, the corrections made pursuant to this section shall be used to recalculate the taxes due. Section 9. That chapter 10-6 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: If a person not entitled to an assessment value under this Act inadvertently receives a lower assessment value, the person is not required to pay the unpaid taxes, penalties, or interest.

The director may not adopt as a criterion of value the price for which the property would sell at a forced sale, or in the aggregate with all the property in the third class municipality or district. The director shall value each article or description by itself and at an amount or price as he the director believes the property to be fairly worth in money pursuant to sections 1 to 9, inclusive, of this Act .
