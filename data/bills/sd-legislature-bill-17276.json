The annual tax provided by this section may not be less than twenty-four dollars. Section 18. Except for taxes on real property and license fees and other fees imposed by this Act, the tax imposed in section 17 of this Act is in lieu of all other taxes and license fees, state, county, or local, upon the business of the licensee, or upon any money, credits, or other assets of the licensee whether tangible or intangible, and which money, credits, or other assets are used for or in connection with the conduct of business transacted in South Dakota.

These reports shall be under oath and on forms prescribed by the division by rule or order. Section 20. The division shall annually conduct an examination of business records and accounts of any licensee licensed under this Act. The director may order an examination if circumstances require a special examination. The director may charge back to the licensee any cost associated with an on-site examination.

If a licensee conducts a self-examination, the licensee shall provide any information requested under oath and on forms provided by the division by order or rule. Section 21. Before disbursing funds under a deferred presentment service transaction, a licensee shall provide to the maker of the check a clear and conspicuous printed notice indicating: (1) That a deferred presentment service transaction is not intended to meet long-term financial needs; (2) That the maker of a check should use a deferred presentment service transaction only to meet short-term cash needs; (3) That the maker of a check will be required to pay additional fees if the deferred presentment service transaction is renewed rather than paid in full when due.

A violation of this section is a Class 1 misdemeanor. Section 24. A licensee may not renew a deferred presentment service transaction more than four times. No renewal may be allowed unless the maker of the check pays the outstanding fee at the time of the renewal. Section 25.

The written agreement must contain the following: (1) The name of the licensee; (2) The transaction date; (3) The amount of the check; (4) The dates any payments are due and the amount of payments; (5) A statement of the total amount of fees charged, expressed as a dollar amount and as an annual percentage rate; (6) The method used to compute the charges; (7) An explanation of the charges; and (8) Any charge that may be applied for delinquency. The written agreement must authorize the licensee to defer presentment or negotiation of the check until a specified date. The maker of a check may redeem the check from the licensee at any time before the negotiation or presentment of the check without prepayment penalty by making payment to the licensee. However, the maker may rescind the transaction by the close of the following business day at no cost. A violation of this section is a Class 1 misdemeanor. Section 26. If a check is returned to the licensee from a payer financial institution due to insufficient funds, closed account, or a stop payment order, the licensee has the right to all civil remedies available to collect the check. The licensee may contract for and collect a returned check charge not to exceed thirty dollars per customer, per check, per year.

A violation of this section is a Class 1 misdemeanor. Section 29. A licensee shall provide a notice in a prominent place on each deferred presentment service agreement in no less than twelve-point type in substantially the following form: State law prohibits this business from allowing customers to have outstanding at any one time, deferred presentment service transactions totaling more than five hundred dollars.

The annual tax provided by this section may not be less than twenty-four dollars. Section 18. Except for taxes on real property and license fees and other fees imposed by this Act, the tax imposed in section 17 of this Act is in lieu of all other taxes and license fees, state, county, or local, upon the business of the licensee, or upon any money, credits, or other assets of the licensee whether tangible or intangible, and which money, credits, or other assets are used for or in connection with the conduct of business transacted in South Dakota.

The director may waive an on-site examination and only require an annual self-examination. If a licensee conducts a self-examination, the licensee shall provide any information requested under oath and on forms provided by the division by order or rule. Section 21.

A violation of this section is a Class 1 misdemeanor. Section 24. A licensee may not renew a deferred presentment service transaction more than four times. No renewal may be allowed unless the maker of the check pays the outstanding fee at the time of the renewal. Section 25.

The written agreement must contain the following: (1) The name of the licensee; (2) The transaction date; (3) The amount of the check; (4) The dates any payments are due and the amount of payments; (5) A statement of the total amount of fees charged, expressed as a dollar amount and as an annual percentage rate; (6) The method used to compute the charges; (7) An explanation of the charges; and (8) Any charge that may be applied for delinquency. The written agreement must authorize the licensee to defer presentment or negotiation of the check until a specified date. The maker of a check may redeem the check from the licensee at any time before the negotiation or presentment of the check without prepayment penalty by making payment to the licensee. However, the maker may rescind the transaction by the close of the following business day at no cost. A violation of this section is a Class 1 misdemeanor. Section 26. If a check is returned to the licensee from a payer financial institution due to insufficient funds, closed account, or a stop payment order, the licensee has the right to all civil remedies available to collect the check. The licensee may contract for and collect a returned check charge not to exceed thirty dollars per customer, per check, per year.
