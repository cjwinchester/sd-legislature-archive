BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. The Department of Military and Veterans Affairs shall conduct a study of the need for and feasibility of establishing a state veterans cemetery in the eastern half of South Dakota. In conducting the study, the department may use its own staff and resources and may contract with one or more consultants or other entities. Section 2. In determining the need for a state veterans cemetery, the study shall address the following: (1) The number of veterans in the eastern half of the state delineated by region and population center; (2) An estimate of the number and percentage of veterans who would choose burial in a state veterans cemetery if the cemetery were located within seventy-five miles of their homes and one hundred fifty miles of their homes, or similar estimates based on distance from home; (3) An estimate of the number and percentage of veterans who would choose burial at the Black Hills National Cemetery or a national veterans cemetery in another state regardless of whether or not a state veterans cemetery in eastern South Dakota were available; (4) A delineation of trends in the veteran population in South Dakota by age group; (5) A description of burial locations currently and historically used by South Dakota veterans and veterans in other states in relation to distance from civilian cemeteries and state and national veterans cemeteries; (6) Any other information that may assist in predicting the potential usage by South Dakota veterans of a state veterans cemetery. Section 3. The study shall identify the three potentially most suitable sites or areas for a state veterans cemetery, based on population, accessibility, and site characteristics, as well as other factors identified in the course of the study. Section 4. The study shall include an estimate of the costs to establish and maintain a state veterans cemetery, including federal funding potentially available through the state cemetery grant program, federal funding as a percentage of total costs to establish a cemetery, the cost to maintain a state veterans cemetery, historical and projected inflation rates in maintenance costs, costs of potential expansions, and other factors affecting the short- and long-range costs of establishing and maintaining a state veterans cemetery. Section 5. There is hereby appropriated from the general fund the sum of forty thousand dollars ($ 40,000 ), or so much thereof as may be necessary, to the Department of Military and Veterans Affairs to implement the study required pursuant to this Act. Section 6. The Adjutant General shall approve vouchers and the state auditor shall draw warrants to pay expenditures authorized by this Act. Section 7. Any amounts appropriated in this Act not lawfully expended or obligated by June 30, 2008, shall revert in accordance with \u00a7 4-8-21."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 21601, "action_date": "2007-01-25T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 110857, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/110857.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 201, "committee_id_action": 923, "committee_id_assigned": 910, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 21601, "action_date": "2007-02-07T08:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 111714, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/111714.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 910, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 21601, "action_date": "2007-02-09T08:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 111921, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/111921.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 910, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 21601, "action_date": "2007-02-12T08:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 111988, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/111988.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 910, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 21601, "action_date": "2007-02-13T08:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 112157, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/112157.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 910, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 21601, "action_date": "2007-02-14T08:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 112247, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/112247.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 910, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 21601, "action_date": "2007-02-14T08:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 112247, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/112247.pdf", "status_text": "Tabled", "journal_page": 519, "committee_id_action": 910, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 65183, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [3580, 3581, 3586, 3600], "Yea": [3583, 3611, 3655, 3666, 3654]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/21601"}
