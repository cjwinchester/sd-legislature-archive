BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 13-28-34 be amended to read: 13-28-34. A No school district board member, school administrator, or nor any school employee may not directly or indirectly give or promise to give, either directly or indirectly, any rebate or refund of any transportation or any other thing anything of value, including any rebate or refund of the value of transportation, as an inducement for attending enrolling in any school in a district in the state receiving state aid pursuant to \u00a7 13-13-73. This section does not apply to any person providing information to parents and students about resources and services generally available in the school district. Any person violating the provisions of this section is guilty of a Class 2 misdemeanor theft or attempted theft pursuant to chapter 22-30A and \u00a7 22-4-1, and shall be prosecuted by the attorney general. A violation is also grounds for the suspension, revocation, or nonrenewal of any certificate pursuant to \u00a7 13-42-9. If a holder of such a certificate is prosecuted pursuant to this section, the attorney general shall file a complaint with the appropriate professional practices and standards commission created pursuant to chapter 13-43. Section 2. That \u00a7 13-13-1.3 be amended to read: 13-13-1.3. If, in the department's examination of fall enrollment, it is determined that the data was overreported, the department shall recover the amount of state aid overpaid as a result of the overreporting. Upon recovery of the overpayment, the department shall deposit the overpayment into the state general fund. If the overreporting occurred with the intent to increase the amount of state aid received by overreporting, the person responsible for the overreporting may be charged with a Class 1 misdemeanor as provided in \u00a7 13-8-44, with the maximum penalty as defined in \u00a7 22-6-2 is guilty of theft or attempted theft pursuant to chapter 22-30A and \u00a7 22-4-1, and shall be prosecuted by the attorney general.

If a holder of such a certificate is prosecuted pursuant to this section, the attorney general shall file a complaint with the appropriate professional practices and standards commission created pursuant to chapter 13-43. Section 3. That subdivision (2A) of \u00a7 13-13-10.1 be amended to read: (2A) \"Fall enrollment,\" is calculated as follows: (a) Determine the number of kindergarten through twelfth grade students enrolled in all schools operated by the school district on one of the last Friday ten calendar days of September of the current school year selected randomly by the secretary of the Department of Education, on or after October first of the current school year; (b) Subtract the number of students for whom the district receives tuition except for: (i) Nonresident students who are in the care and custody of a state agency and are attending a public school district; (ii) Students who are being provided an education pursuant to \u00a7 13-28-11; and (iii) Students for whom tuition is being paid pursuant to \u00a7 13-28-42.1; and (c) Add the number of students for whom the district pays tuition. The school district superintendent shall certify the fall enrollment under penalty of perjury. When computing state aid to education for a school district pursuant to \u00a7 13-13-73, the secretary of the Department of Education shall use the school district's fall enrollment; Section 4. That \u00a7 13-28-43 be amended to read: 13-28-43. A student's parent or legal guardian who wishes to enroll the student, or an emancipated student who wishes to enroll, under the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 13-28-40 to 13-28-47, inclusive, in a South Dakota school district other than the resident district or in a school within the resident district other than the school to which the student has been assigned shall apply on forms provided by the Department of Education. The school board or the board's designee of the district in which the student desires to enroll shall approve or disapprove the application and shall notify the applicant and the resident board, if applicable, of its decision within five days of the decision. The district in which the student desires to enroll shall review the applications in the order received. However, if the applicant is a sibling of a student accepted into and currently enrolled in the district pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 13-28- 40 to 13-28-47, inclusive, that student's application shall take priority over all other applications the district has received consistent with \u00a7 13-28-44. Transfers to a school district other than the resident school district under the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 13-28-40 to 13-28-47, inclusive, may only take place prior to the last Friday in September twentieth during the first semester of any school year, and prior to the last Friday in January during the second semester of any school year. If a school district approves an application for such a transfer after the deadline in the first semester, the transfer will occur at the start of the second semester. If a school district approves an application for such a transfer after the deadline in the second semester, the transfer will occur at the start of the following school year. However, the deadlines for transfer do not apply if: (1) A student is seeking to transfer to an alternative school or a specialized nonpublic educational program; (2) A student enrolls in a school district after the deadline in either semester; or (3) The receiving school district school board or the board's designee determines that special circumstances exist and allows a student to transfer after the deadline. Intradistrict transfer applications may be accepted and acted upon at any time at the board's discretion if the policies on which the transfer decisions are based are consistent with the other requirements of \u00a7\u00a7 13-28-40 to 13-28-47, inclusive. An application may be withdrawn by the applicant prior to the approval of the request and upon notification of the district to which the student applied. Once approved by the district in which the student wishes to enroll, the approved application serves as the applicant's notice of intent to enroll in the nonresident district or desired school during the school year and obligates the student to attend school in the nonresident district or desired school during the school year, unless the affected school board or boards agree in writing to allow the student to transfer back to the resident district or assigned school, or unless the parents, guardians, or emancipated student change residence to another district. Once enrolled in a nonresident district or nonassigned school, the student may remain enrolled and is not required to resubmit annual applications."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 8541, "action_date": "2018-01-25T13:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 48021, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/48021.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 196, "committee_id_action": 396, "committee_id_assigned": 394, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 8541, "action_date": "2018-02-14T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 49068, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/49068.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 394, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 8541, "action_date": "2018-02-14T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 49260, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/49260.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to the 41st legislative day", "journal_page": 455, "committee_id_action": 394, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 25825, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [1424, 1425, 1279, 1226, 1299, 1240, 1215, 1229, 1265, 1257], "Nay": [1306, 1247, 1277]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/8541"}
