This chapter does not prohibit a public officer who has taken an oath to defend the United States Constitution from interposing to stop acts of the federal government that have been declared to be an unconstitutional federal action. South Dakota officials in federal, state, and local government shall honor their oaths to preserve, protect, and defend the United States Constitution and shall act to constitutionally defend this state and the people of this state.
