Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of South Dakota: Section 1. That \u00a7 61-5-25 be AMENDED: 61-5-25. If an employer has met the requirements of \u00a7 61-5-24 on the computation date for the year, then the employer's contribution rate shall be the rate appearing in Column \"A\" on the same line the employer's reserve ratio appears in Column \"B\" of the rate schedule applicable to that year. The computation date for calendar year 2012 and each year thereafter is June thirtieth of the preceding year. The rate schedule for each calendar year shall be determined based upon the South Dakota average high cost multiplier ratio. The average high cost multiplier ratio is calculated by dividing the amount in the unemployment compensation fund, as established by \u00a7 61-4-1, as of June thirtieth of the preceding year, by the amount required in the unemployment compensation fund that equals the average high cost multiple of 1.0, as of December thirty-first of the last completed calendar year. The following rate schedules apply: (1) From January 1, 2018, to December 31, 2023, inclusive: (a) Schedule A is in effect for any calendar year when the South Dakota average high cost multiplier ratio is less than 1.60; and (b) Schedule B is in effect for any calendar year when the South Dakota average high cost multiplier ratio is greater than or equal to 1.60. (2) Beginning January 1, 2024: (a) Schedule A is in effect for any calendar year when the South Dakota average high cost multiplier ratio is less than 1.30; (b) Schedule B is in effect for any calendar year when the South Dakota average high cost multiplier ratio is less than 1.50 and greater than or equal to 1.30; and (c) Schedule C is in effect for any calendar year when the South Dakota average high cost multiplier ratio is greater than or equal to 1.50.

The employer's experience-rating account balance for the purpose of this section is the balance on July thirty-first of the year preceding the year rates are calculated and is the difference between the contributions paid through July thirty-first and the benefits paid through the preceding June thirtieth.

Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of South Dakota: Section 1. That \u00a7 61-5-25 be AMENDED: 61-5-25. If an employer has met the requirements of \u00a7 61-5-24 on the computation date for the year, then the employer's contribution rate shall be the rate appearing in Column \"A\" on the same line the employer's reserve ratio appears in Column \"B\" of the rate schedule applicable to that year. The computation date for calendar year 2012 and each year thereafter is June thirtieth of the preceding year. The rate schedule for each calendar year shall be determined based upon the South Dakota average high cost multiplier ratio. The average high cost multiplier ratio is calculated by dividing the amount in the unemployment compensation fund, as established by \u00a7 61-4-1, as of June thirtieth of the preceding year, by the amount required in the unemployment compensation fund that equals the average high cost multiple of 1.0, as of December thirty-first of the last completed calendar year. The following rate schedules apply: (1) From January 1, 2018, to December 31, 2023, inclusive: (a) Schedule A is in effect for any calendar year when the South Dakota average high cost multiplier ratio is less than 1.60; and (b) Schedule B is in effect for any calendar year when the South Dakota average high cost multiplier ratio is greater than or equal to 1.60. (2) Beginning January 1, 2024: (a) Schedule A is in effect for any calendar year when the South Dakota average high cost multiplier ratio is less than 1.30; (b) Schedule B is in effect for any calendar year when the South Dakota average high cost multiplier ratio is less than 1.50 and greater than or equal to 1.30; and (c) Schedule C is in effect for any calendar year when the South Dakota average high cost multiplier ratio is greater than or equal to 1.50. For purposes of this section, the term, average high cost multiple, has the same meaning given in 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 606.3, as amended on September 17, 2010. An amount equal to an average high cost multiple of 1.0 is a federal measure of adequate reserves in relation to the state's current economy. Section 2. That \u00a7 61-5-25.5 be AMENDED: 61-5-25.5.

The employer's experience-rating account balance for the purpose of this section is the balance on July thirty-first of the year preceding the year rates are calculated and is the difference between the contributions paid through July thirty-first and the benefits paid through the preceding June thirtieth.
