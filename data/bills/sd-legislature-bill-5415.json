Raw milk for human consumption is regulated pursuant to sections 1 to 4, inclusive, of this Act. Section 2. Each producer of raw milk for human consumption for direct sale from the producer to the consumer shall meet the following requirements.

No more than once each year, the secretary of the Department of Agriculture may request the previous year's test results from the producer. If the secretary finds the producer has not met the testing requirements and standards in section 2 of this Act, the secretary shall work with the producer to identify the source of and solutions to any problems with the producer's production. Section 4. Nothing in this Act regulates or prohibits the isolated or occasional sale, trade, or barter of raw milk by a person who is selling, trading, or bartering less than an average of five hundred gallons of raw milk per month.
