WHEREAS, South Dakota's sheep industry plays an important role in the state's overall economy and in the support of South Dakota's rural communities and its agricultural economy; and WHEREAS, South Dakota is among the top five lamb and wool producing states, contributing significantly to the national economy; and WHEREAS, the American sheep industry is in a period of severe distress primarily because of the flooding of American markets with imported wool and low-priced imported woolen products, as well as other problems, ranging from predators to weather cycles; and WHEREAS, data from the United States Department of Agriculture indicates less than eight million head of sheep in the United States at the present time, compared with more than fifty million during the 1950s; and WHEREAS, lamb prices fell forty percent between 1997 and 1999. Currently, forty percent of the 1998 wool clip in the United States is unsold and more than fifty percent of the 1999 wool clip is unsold; and WHEREAS, European countries have rigid quotas on United States lamb and wool that also cause hardship for American producers; and WHEREAS, in July of 1999, while in South Dakota, President Clinton announced imposition of Section 201 trade restrictions on imported lamb. This trade relief must be maintained through the year 2002; and WHEREAS, South Dakota Governor William Janklow assisted in providing twenty thousand dollars to the American Sheep Industry Association to assist them in their Section 201 case with the United States International Trade Commission, which resulted in the provision of one hundred million dollars in assistance to the American sheep industry over a three-year period; and WHEREAS, in accordance with United States trade law, all available actions must be taken to ensure full trade relief for United States sheep producers; and WHEREAS, the South Dakota Sheep Growers and the Western South Dakota Sheep Growers are united in their efforts to find economic solutions for their industry; and WHEREAS, the wool market depression continues to impose serious hardship on South Dakota's sheep producers: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the House of Representatives of the Seventy- fifth Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the Senate concurring therein, that the Legislature urges further assistance and support for the American sheep industry to overcome the negative impacts of imported wool and wool products that have flooded markets and reduced the prices paid to American sheep producers. All appropriate short- and long-term revenue stabilization measures should be taken to assist the farms and ranches that produce our country's wool and to promote and preserve a sound sheep industry."}, {"bill_id": 15541, "bill_version_id": 87272, "bill_version": "Enrolled", "bill_version_date": "2000-02-22T00:00:00-06:00", "bill_text": "February 10, 2000 February 17, 2000"}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 15541, "action_date": "2000-02-08T08:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 85881, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/85881.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to 36th legislative day", "journal_page": 348, "committee_id_action": 655, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 43932, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [2322, 2364, 2306, 2307, 2395, 2326], "Nay": [2331, 2344, 2357, 2340]}}, {"bill_id": 15541, "action_date": "2000-02-10T08:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 85905, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/85905.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 642, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 15541, "action_date": "2000-02-10T08:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 85905, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/85905.pdf", "status_text": "Adopt Resolution", "journal_page": 556, "committee_id_action": 642, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 44196, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [2318, 2327, 2341, 2354, 2366, 2390, 2392, 2403, 2316, 2355, 2367, 2404, 2309]}}, {"bill_id": 15541, "action_date": "2000-02-11T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 85666, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/85666.pdf", "status_text": "Adopt Resolution", "journal_page": 604, "committee_id_action": 656, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 46209, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [2305, 2308, 2309, 2312, 2313, 2314, 2315, 2316, 2317, 2318, 2319, 2321, 2323, 2324, 2325, 2327, 2328, 2332, 2333, 2334, 2336, 2337, 2338, 2341, 2342, 2343, 2345, 2348, 2349, 2350, 2353, 2354, 2355, 2356, 2359, 2360, 2361, 2362, 2363, 2366, 2367, 2368, 2370, 2371, 2372, 2373, 2374, 2377, 2378, 2379, 2382, 2383, 2384, 2385, 2387, 2388, 2390, 2392, 2393, 2397, 2401, 2402, 2406, 2407, 2408, 2351], "Excused": [2394, 2396, 2403, 2404]}}, {"bill_id": 15541, "action_date": "2000-02-17T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 85955, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/85955.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 630, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 15541, "action_date": "2000-02-17T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 85955, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/85955.pdf", "status_text": "Concur In resolution", "journal_page": 544, "committee_id_action": 630, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 44654, "president_vote": null, "Excused": [2310, 2358], "Yea": [2311, 2346, 2347, 2386, 2398, 2400, 2329]}}, {"bill_id": 15541, "action_date": "2000-02-17T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 85955, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/85955.pdf", "status_text": "Place on Consent Calendar", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 630, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 15541, "action_date": "2000-02-18T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 85677, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/85677.pdf", "status_text": "Concur In resolution", "journal_page": 574, "committee_id_action": 657, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 44734, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [2304, 2306, 2307, 2310, 2311, 2320, 2322, 2326, 2329, 2330, 2331, 2335, 2339, 2340, 2344, 2346, 2347, 2352, 2357, 2358, 2364, 2365, 2369, 2375, 2376, 2380, 2381, 2386, 2389, 2391, 2395, 2398, 2399, 2400, 2405]}}]}
