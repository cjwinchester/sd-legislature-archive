BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That chapter 28-6 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: The Department of Social Services may provide to a family with a disabled child the opportunity to purchase coverage under the medicaid program for the disabled child if the family does not have sufficient income and resources to meet the medical costs for providing the necessary medical services to the child with the disability. This section creates the state option to allow families of disabled children to purchase medicaid coverage under section 6062 of the Family Opportunity Act of 2004, as amended January 1, 2007. To be eligible to participate in this program the child with the disability must be less than eighteen years old and would be considered to be disabled and eligible under Title XIX of the federal Social Security Act, as amended January 1, 2007, but for having earnings or deemed income or resources that exceed the requirements for the receipt of supplemental security income benefits. The family income for the child with the disability may not exceed three hundred percent of federal poverty level applicable to the family size involved. The Department of Social Services may promulgate rules to specify the individuals and services for which state funds and federal financial participation are available and may include: (1) A requirement for the parent to apply for, enroll in, and pay premiums for any employer provided family coverage health benefits; (2) The share of the premium set on a sliding scale based on family income to be paid by the department, the parent and the employer; and (3) A limit on the aggregate amount of the premium that the parent is required to pay for family coverage that does not exceed 7.5 percent of the family's income. The department may not require the prepayment of a premium to participate in this program. The department may not terminate the eligibility of a child under this program for failure to pay a premium until the failure to pay continues for a period of not less than sixty days from which the premium became past due. The department may waive the payment of any past due premium if it determines that requiring the payment would create an undue hardship."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 21521, "action_date": "2007-01-30T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 111185, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/111185.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 261, "committee_id_action": 923, "committee_id_assigned": 911, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 21521, "action_date": "2007-02-05T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 111535, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/111535.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 911, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 21521, "action_date": "2007-02-05T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 111535, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/111535.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to 41st legislative day", "journal_page": 331, "committee_id_action": 911, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 66791, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [3572, 3592, 3663], "Yea": [3576, 3619, 3622, 3642, 3644, 3650, 3676, 3658], "Excused": [3588, 3645]}}]}
