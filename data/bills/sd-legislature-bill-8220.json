The terms and conditions of probation of a child in need of supervision shall be specified by rules or orders of the court and by a court services officer. The duration of juvenile probation shall be specified by order of the court but may not exceed four six months unless: (1) The child is placed in the intensive juvenile probation program; or (2) The child's probation is extended as provided under this section.

If probation is terminated with restitution owing, Unified Judicial System procedure may govern the collection. Each child placed on probation shall be given a written statement of the terms and conditions of probation and the probation policy. The terms and conditions, as well as the probation extension policy, shall be explained to the child. The court shall review the terms and conditions of probation and the progress of each child placed on probation at least once every four six months.
