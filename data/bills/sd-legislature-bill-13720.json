Further, it is the intent of the Legislature that any such approved arrangement shall be exempt from federal laws governing unfair trade practices, antitrust, or restraint of trade. Except with respect to such joint provisioning of facilities and revenue pooling arrangements approved by the commission, both state and federal laws governing unfair trade practices, antitrust, and restraint of trade shall apply with full force and effect.
