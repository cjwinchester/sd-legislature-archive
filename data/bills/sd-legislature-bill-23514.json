Presently, the Oglala Sioux Tribe (OST) Department of Public Safety is grossly underfunded by 40 percent due to the federal government leaving treaty obligations unfulfilled. The substantial lack of funding cripples the current capacity of 33 federally funded positions and 19 grant and tribally funded positions.

The demand has overwhelmed staff, decreased response time in life and death scenarios, and ultimately undermined the confidence in law enforcement and rule of law; and WHEREAS, the Rosebud Sioux Tribe experiences similar effects of the lack of resources; and WHEREAS, due to the overwhelming need, severity of crimes, and lack of support of the tribal departments of public safety, violent crimes have become far too familiar, thus resulting in unsafe living conditions for elders, children, and community members.
