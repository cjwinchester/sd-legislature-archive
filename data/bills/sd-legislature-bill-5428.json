Upon application, the department shall submit completed fingerprint cards to the Division of Criminal Investigation.

This information must be obtained prior to certification of the applicant. The department may require a state and federal criminal background check for any licensee who is the subject of a disciplinary investigation by the department. Failure to submit or cooperate with the criminal background investigation is grounds for denial of an application or may result in revocation of a license. The applicant shall pay for any fees charged for the cost of fingerprinting and the criminal background investigation. Section 2. That chapter 36-21B be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: The department shall deny issuance of a certificate to any applicant who: (1) Has had the ability to perform appraisals revoked in any governmental jurisdiction within the five year period immediately preceding the date of application; (2) Has been convicted of, or pled guilty or nolo contendere to, a felony in a domestic or foreign court either during the five-year period immediately preceding the date of the application for certification, licensure, or registration or at any time preceding the date of
