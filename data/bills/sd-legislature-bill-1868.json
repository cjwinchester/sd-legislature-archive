BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That chapter 58-17 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: No policy of group health insurance providing benefits for hospital and medical expenses delivered in this state that is offered by a commercial health insurance company, by a nonprofit medical and surgical plan corporation, by a nonprofit hospital service plan corporation, by a health maintenance organization, by a preferred provider organization, by an individual practice association, or by any similar mechanism may: (1) Exclude or restrict benefits for prescription contraceptive drugs or devices that prevent conception and that are approved by the Federal Drug Administration, or generic equivalents approved as substitutable by the Federal Drug Administration, if the policy or contract provides benefits for other outpatient prescription drugs or devices; or (2) Exclude or restrict benefits for outpatient contraceptive services that are provided for the purpose of preventing conception if the policy or contract provides benefits for other outpatient services provided by a health care professional. The provisions of this section do not apply to policies that provide coverage for a specified disease or other limited benefit coverage. Section 2. That chapter 58-17 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: No group policy or contract that is subject to section 1 of this Act and that provides for third-party payment or prepayment of hospital or medical expenses may: (1) Deny to an individual eligibility, or continued eligibility, to enroll in or to renew coverage under the terms of the policy or contract because of the individual's use or potential use of prescription contraceptive drugs or devices or use or potential use of outpatient contraception services; (2) Provide a monetary payment or rebate to a covered individual to encourage the individual to accept less than the minimum benefits provided pursuant to section 1 of this Act; (3) Penalize or otherwise reduce or limit the reimbursement of a health care professional because the professional prescribes contraceptive drugs or devices or provides contraceptive services; (4) Provide incentives, monetary or otherwise, to a health care professional to induce the professional to withhold from a covered individual contraceptive drugs or devices or contraceptive services. Section 3. That chapter 58-17 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Nothing in this Act may be construed to prevent a third-party payer from including deductibles, coinsurance, or copayments in the policy or contract, as follows: (1) A deducible, coinsurance, or copayment for benefits for prescription contraceptive drugs may not be greater than the deductible, coinsurance, or copayment for any outpatient prescription drug for which coverage under the policy or contract is provided; (2) A deductible, coinsurance, or copayment for benefits for prescription contraceptive devices may not be greater than the deductible, coinsurance, or copayment for any outpatient health care services for which coverage under the policy or contract is provided; and (3) A deductible, coinsurance, or copayment for benefits for outpatient contraceptive services may not be greater than the deductible, coinsurance, or copayment for any outpatient prescription device for which coverage under the policy or contract is provided. Section 4. That chapter 58-17 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Nothing in this Act may be construed to require a third-party payer under a policy or contract to provide benefits for experimental or investigational contraceptive drugs or devices, or experimental or investigational contraceptive services, except to the extent that the policy or contract provides coverage for other experimental or investigational outpatient prescription drugs or devices, or experimental or investigational outpatient health care services. Section 5. That chapter 58-17 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Nothing in this Act may be construed to limit or otherwise discourage the use of generic equivalent drugs approved by the Federal Drug Administration, whenever available and appropriate. If a brand name drug is requested by a covered individual and a suitable generic equivalent is available and appropriate, nothing in this Act may be construed to prohibit a third_party payer from requiring the covered individual to pay a deductible, coinsurance, or copayment consistent with section 3 of this Act, in addition to the difference of the cost of the brand name drug less the maximum covered amount for a generic equivalent. Section 6. That chapter 58-17 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Any person who provides an individual policy or contract providing for third-party payment or prepayment of hospital or medical expenses shall make available a coverage provision that satisfies the requirements of this Act in the same manner as the requirements are applicable to a group policy or contract under this Act. The policy or contract shall provide that the individual policyholder may reject the coverage provision at the option of the policyholder."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log":
