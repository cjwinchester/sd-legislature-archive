The person whose confidence creates a trust is called the trustor; the person in whom the confidence is reposed is called the trustee; and the person for whose benefit the trust is created is called the beneficiary. As used in this title, except as specifically provided in chapters 55-13 and 55-13A, the term, beneficiary, means a person that has a present or future beneficial interest in a trust, vested or contingent. A person is not a beneficiary solely by reason of holding a power of appointment. As used in this section, the term, person, has the meaning set forth in \u00a7 55-4-1. Section 10. That \u00a7 55-1-24 be amended to read as follows: 55-1-24. Terms used in \u00a7\u00a7 55-1-24 to 55-1-45, inclusive, mean: (1) \"Beneficial interest,\" is limited to mean a distribution interest or a remainder interest. A beneficial interest specifically excludes a power of appointment or a power reserved by the settlor; (2) \"Beneficiary,\" a person that has a present or future beneficial interest in a trust, vested or contingent. The holder of a power of appointment is not a beneficiary; (3) \"Distribution beneficiary,\" a beneficiary who is an eligible distributee or permissible distributee of trust income or principal; (4)(3) \"Distribution interest,\" a distribution interest held by a distribution beneficiary. A distribution interest may be a current distribution interest or a future distribution interest. A distribution interest may be classified as a mandatory interest, a support interest, or a discretionary interest; (5)(4) \"Power of appointment,\" an inter-vivos or testamentary power to direct the disposition of trust property, other than a distribution decision by a trustee to a beneficiary. Powers of appointment are held by a person to whom a power has been given, not the settlor; (6)(5) \"Reach,\" with respect to a distribution interest or power, to subject the distribution interest or power to a judgment, decree, garnishment, attachment, execution, levy, creditor's bill or other legal, equitable, or administrative process, relief, or control of any court, tribunal, agency, or other entity as provided by law; (7)(6) \"Remainder interest,\" an interest where a trust beneficiary will receive receives the property outright at some time during the future; (8)(7) \"Reserved power,\" a power held by the settlor. Section 11. That \u00a7 55-1-25 be amended to read as follows: 55-1-25. The common law distinction between a discretionary trust and a support trust and the dual judicial review standards related to this distinction shall be maintained. In the area of creditor rights, the Restatement of Trusts (Third) and the Uniform Trust Code creates create many new positions of law as well as adopts many minority positions of law. Sections The provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 55-1-24 to 55-1-43, inclusive, affirmatively reject many of these positions. Therefore, the Legislature does not intend the courts to consult the Restatement (Third) of the Law of Trusts Articles \u00a7 50, \u00a7 56, \u00a7 58, \u00a7 59, or \u00a7 60 as approved by the American Law Institute of or Uniform Trust Code Article 5 and Section 814(a) as approved by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws in 2004 with respect to subject matters addressed by the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 55-1-24 to 55-1-43, inclusive. Section 12. That \u00a7 55-1-36 be amended to read as follows: 55-1-36. If a settlor is also a beneficiary of the trust, and the transfer is a qualified transfer under pursuant to chapter 55-16, the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 55-1-24 to 55-1-43, inclusive, also apply. Conversely, if the settlor is a beneficiary of the trust and the transfer is not a qualified transfer under pursuant to chapter 55-16, a provision restraining the voluntary or involuntary transfer of the settlor's beneficial interest does not prevent the settlor's creditors from satisfying claims from the settlor's interest in the trust estate. However, regardless of whether the transfer is a qualified transfer under chapter 55-16, a settlor's creditors may not satisfy claims from either assets of the trust because of the existence of a discretionary power granted to the trustee by the terms of the trust instrument creating the trust, or any other provisions of law, to pay directly to the taxing authorities or to reimburse the settlor for any tax on trust income or principal which is payable by the settlor under the law imposing such tax; or reimbursements made to the settlor or direct tax payments made to a taxing authority for the settlor's benefit for any tax or trust income or principal which is payable by the trustor under the law imposing such tax. Section 13. That chapter 55-1 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Regardless of whether the transfer is a qualified transfer pursuant to chapter 55-16, a settlor's creditors may not satisfy claims from either assets of the trust because of the existence of a discretionary power granted to the trustee by the terms of the trust instrument creating the trust, or any other provisions of law, to pay directly to the taxing authorities or to reimburse the settlor for any tax on trust income or principal which is payable by the settlor under the law imposing the tax. No reimbursement may be made to the settlor or direct tax payment made to a taxing authority for the settlor's benefit for any tax or trust income or principal which is payable by the trustor under the law imposing the tax. Section 14. That chapter 55-1 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: The terms of a governing instrument may expand, restrict, eliminate, or otherwise vary any provisions of general application to trusts and trust administration. Nothing in this section allows the terms of the governing instrument to expand, restrict, eliminate, or otherwise vary the duties, restrictions, and liabilities imposed by the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 55-4-10 to 55-4-12, inclusive. Section 15. That chapter 55-1 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: In addition to the trustee's power to submit to an arbitration claim in favor of or against a trust or trustee as set forth in \u00a7 55-1A-25, a provision in a trust requiring the arbitration of a dispute between or among the beneficiaries, a fiduciary under the will or trust, or any combination of them, is enforceable pursuant to the provisions of chapter 21-25A. Unless otherwise provided in the governing instrument or a court order, the arbitration shall be held in this state. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a challenge to the validity of all or part of the trust is not subject to arbitration. Any proceeding pursuant to this section is subject, upon request by the acting trustee, the trustor, if living, or any beneficiary, to the privacy protections of \u00a7 21-22-28. The arbitrator shall grant the request, if made. Section 16. That \u00a7 55-1A-9.1 be amended to read as follows: 55-1A-9.1.

(c) A trustee seeking compensation pursuant to subsection (b) of this section shall disclose to all qualified those beneficiaries, as defined in \u00a7 55-2-13, all fees, commissions, compensation or other benefits and profits paid or to be paid by the account, or received or to be received by an affiliate arising from such affiliated investment.

Such disclosure shall be made at least annually unless there has been no increase in the rate at which such fees or commissions are calculated since the most recent disclosure. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this subsection, no such disclosure is required if the: (i) The governing instrument or a court order expressly authorizes the trustee to invest the trust account in affiliated investments or otherwise deal with an affiliate or an interest in an affiliated investment;or (ii) The directed trustee is acting at the direction of an investment trust advisor pursuant to chapter 55-1B. (d) A trustee that has complied with subsection (c) of this section (whether by making the applicable disclosure or by relying on the terms of a governing instrument or court order) shall have full authority to administer an affiliated investment (including the authority to vote proxies thereon) without regard to the affiliation between the trustee and the investment. (e) If the recipients of information regarding the trust's existence have been restricted, eliminated, or modified pursuant to \u00a7 55-2-13, then the notification described in subsection (c) is subject to such restriction, modification, or elimination. Section 17. That \u00a7 55-3-20.1 be amended to read as follows: 55-3-20.1. In addition to other remedies available by law and procedures or powers set out in a trust instrument, the settlor, or the settlor's agent, a trust protector, a cotrustee, or a qualified beneficiary as defined in \u00a7 55-2-13, may request the court to remove a trustee, or a trustee may be removed by the court on the court's own initiative.
