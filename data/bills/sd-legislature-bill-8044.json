and WHEREAS, in 1971 he took the South Dakota Rodeo Association (SDRA) year-end all-around cowboy runner-up honors as well as the saddle bronc title at the SDRA Finals; and WHEREAS, in 1972 Howard's entry to the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association was supported by the three-time world saddle bronc champion Shawn Davis and South Dakota rodeo cowboy and rancher Charlie Colombe; and WHEREAS, as a pro saddle bronc rider, Howard Hunter qualified for many prestigious events such as the Wrangler National Finals Rodeo in 1976, 1979, and 1980; and WHEREAS, with extraordinary success Hunter won events at Cheyenne Frontier Days;

and WHEREAS, Howard Hunter, Sr. passed away on Easter Sunday, April 4, 2015, at his Kyle, South Dakota ranch home, surrounded by his life-long rodeo fans, including his wife, Annie; his children, Howard, Jr. and Stacie; and his many relatives and friends; and WHEREAS, given his larger-than-life legacy, both in and out of the rodeo arena, the Oglala Lakota-descendant cowboy was inducted into the South Dakota Rodeo Hall of Fame in 2001 and the Indian National Finals Rodeo Hall of Fame in 2012: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the Senate of the Ninety-Second Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the House of Representatives concurring therein, the South Dakota Legislature heartily and without reservation endorses the induction of Howard Hunter, Sr. into the Pro Rodeo Hall of Fame; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, due to his talent, superb skill, and integrity, the induction of Howard Hunter Sr. into the Pro Rodeo Hall of Fame would honor a South Dakota Plains ranch lifestyle, a set of solid values, and a life well lived that are as relevant today as at any time in the history of our nation;
