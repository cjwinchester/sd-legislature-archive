BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 12-18-6.1 be amended to read as follows: 12-18-6.1. When a voter is requesting a ballot, the voter shall present a valid form of personal identification. The personal identification that may be presented shall be either: (1) A South Dakota driver's license or nondriver identification card; (2) A passport or an identification card, including a picture, issued by an agency of the United States government; (3) A tribal identification card, including a picture; or (4) An identification card, including a picture, issued by a high school or an accredited institution of higher education, including a university, college, or technical school, located within the State of South Dakota. However, any person who is unable to present such personal identification but who is known, by personal recognition and without doubt, by at least two members of the precinct election board to be the person whose name appears on the precinct registration list is not required to present such personal identification, is not required to prepare an affidavit under \u00a7 12-18-6.2, and may vote as provided in \u00a7 12-18-7.1. Section 2. That \u00a7 12-18-6.2 be amended to read as follows: 12-18-6.2. If a voter is not able to present a form of personal identification as required and is not recognized by two members of the precinct election board as provided by \u00a7 12-18-6.1, the voter may complete an affidavit in lieu of the personal identification. The State Board of Elections shall promulgate rules, pursuant to chapter 1-26, prescribing the form of the affidavit. The affidavit shall require the voter to provide his or her name and address. The voter shall sign the affidavit under penalty of perjury. Section 3. That \u00a7 12-18-6.3 be amended to read as follows: 12-18-6.3. The person making an application for ballots shall announce his or her name and present his or her personal identification if required under \u00a7 12-18-6.1 . A member of the precinct election board shall then verify that the picture on the personal identification presented under \u00a7 12-18-6.1 matches such person and that the name on the personal identification appears on the voter precinct registration list pursuant to \u00a7 12-18-7.1. If the member cannot determine from the personal identification presented that the person making an application for ballots is the person listed on the voter precinct registration list, the member may consider other forms of identification, personal knowledge and an explanation from the person making an application for ballots to match that person's name to a name on the registration list. If identity cannot be proven to the satisfaction of the member of the precinct election board or if the person making an application for ballots is challenged on the basis of identity by a member or a poll watcher, the person may vote a provisional ballot."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 19382, "action_date": "2005-01-26T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 103314, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/103314.pdf", "status_text": "First read in Senate and referred to", "journal_page": 186, "committee_id_action": 861, "committee_id_assigned": 841, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 19382, "action_date": "2005-01-31T08:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 103635, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/103635.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 841, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 19382, "action_date": "2005-01-31T08:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 103635, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/103635.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass,", "journal_page": 237, "committee_id_action": 841, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 61277, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [3151, 3163, 3200, 3247], "Nay": [3157, 3179, 3166]}}, {"bill_id": 19382, "action_date": "2005-02-01T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 103842, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/103842.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass,", "journal_page": 277, "committee_id_action": 861, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "F", "vote": {"vote_id": 61419, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [3150, 3154, 3157, 3165, 3168, 3173, 3179, 3180, 3185, 3198, 3205, 3210, 3212, 3214, 3219, 3221, 3224, 3236, 3239, 3242], "Yea": [3151, 3153, 3163, 3186, 3193, 3200, 3201, 3202, 3204, 3228, 3241, 3247], "Excused": [3152, 3166, 3217]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/19382"}
