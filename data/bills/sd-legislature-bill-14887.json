Section 2. That \u00a7 49-31-60 be amended to read as follows: 49-31-60. It is the intent of the Legislature that South Dakota have a telecommunications infrastructure that meets the advanced communication needs of the state's individual citizens and its communities of interest, including our schools, medical facilities, businesses, and all levels of government. To achieve this intent, it is anticipated that three networks, accessible by all South Dakotans, will be established: a narrowband network, a wideband network, and a broadband network. Together, these three networks will form South Dakota's Public Communications Network Infrastructure. This infrastructure will enable any-to-any voice, data, videoconferencing, graphics, imaging, and multimedia communications. These three networks will fully support the following capability requirements: ubiquitous, feature rich, standard, secure, private, survivable, robust, addressable, switched, symmetric, affordable, and available. Communications services will be reasonably and affordably priced to promote the growth and usage of each of these three networks, leveraging the power of technology to provide ever-increasing bandwidths at ever-diminishing cost of facilities . Classes of service will be created for network services in order to establish a service-based and value-based pricing model. The new narrowband, wideband, and broadband communications networks will be established in a manner ensuring that all the citizens of South Dakota realize the advantages of the forthcoming information age, including economic development, educational opportunities, a heightened level of medical care, and better, more efficient service from all levels of government. It is the intent of the Legislature, that: (1) The Public Communications Network Infrastructure will grow and enhance with expanding user needs and advancements in technologies' bandwidth and feature capabilities; (2) The three networks (narrowband, wideband, and broadband) will transport information in fully switched, secure, survivable communications; (3) This layered network hierarchy, based upon a fully integrated SONET backbone of interconnected switched survivable rings, will carry independent and fully integrated voice, data, and video communications; and (4) (3) The network architecture will enable access and interconnection points for public-to-public, public-to-private, and wireline-to-wireless inter-networking. It is the intent of the Legislature that all of the future rules, policies, actions, and decisions of the State of South Dakota and all its political subdivisions, and the actions and decisions of its offices and employees, shall be made consistent with and further the purposes and directives of \u00a7 \u00a7 49-31-60 through 49-31-68, inclusive. Any rule, policy, action, decision, or directive from a regulatory agency shall consider input from common carriers, including local exchange carriers, and others; allow economic deployment of technology; encourage maximum cooperation among facilities providers; and consider a fair return on the investment made by facility providers to implement \u00a7 \u00a7 49-31-60 through 49-31-68, inclusive. Section 3. That \u00a7 49-31-62 be repealed. 49-31-62. The narrowband network is fully switched, digital network covering the transport range from 0 to 144,000 bits per second (144 Kbps), offering two 64 Kbps information B (Bearer) channels and a 16 Kbps signaling D (Delta) channel such that the two channels can be coalesced to achieve 128 Kbps information transport using ISDN international ITU-CCITT standards providing both B channel circuit and B channel packet switching capabilities. Section 4. That \u00a7 49-31-63 be repealed. 49-31-63. To encourage usage of the narrowband network, fully digital and switched transport at narrowband's 64/128 Kbps rates shall be reasonably and affordably priced. Data traffic shall be encouraged to use the narrowband network, which shall be designed with the specific feature and traffic handling capabilities to handle ever-increasing loads of data and video users. Section 5. That \u00a7 49-31-64 be repealed. 49-31-64. If commercially available, the narrowband network shall utilize an ISDN address scheme, including standard interfaces, to support private-to-public-to-private inter-networking. The narrowband network shall establish any-to-any connectivity for data and videoconferencing communications on a dial-up basis. It shall be allowed to overlay the existing voice telephone network, supporting data and video conferencing traffic and shall become fully integrated with the existing voice network. The narrowband network shall utilize a base-satellite fully digital architecture, where stand-alone remote switches located in smaller communities will home-in on larger host switches. This architecture shall allow local switching within a community for emergency services in the event that the link to the host is cut. Section 6. That \u00a7 49-31-65 be repealed. 49-31-65. The deployment goal for the narrowband network is to achieve ubiquitous deployment across South Dakota within five years, with significant results achieved within two years where seventy-five percent of each of the four strategic communities of interest (education COI, medical COI, business COI, and government COI) are provided access to the narrowband network. Section 7. That \u00a7 49-31-66 be repealed. 49-31-66. The wideband network shall physically encompass at least two transport mediums. It shall utilize the capabilities of the copper wire telephone network, as well as fiber optic facilities and rings. The wideband network shall extend the range of fully digital and switched, fully addressable information transport from 144 Kbps to 44.736 Mbps, including the DS1 and DS2 rates of 1.544 Mbps and 6.312 Mbps. Wideband users shall be provided access to multiples of the 64 Kbps channels up to the 44.736 Mbps rate over a fully interactive, switched, symmetric-two way, fully addressable, robust, secure, survivable transport network. The wideband network includes local fiber facilities and ring type architectures at up to DS3 (44.736 Mbps), utilizing the virtual tributary sub-SONET rates. This architecture shall provide robust, diverse routing in the local loop. Class level switching nodes shall be located close to the customer, to extend the class level hierarchy. The wideband access switches will provide direct local public network access, supporting a variety of network switching technologies and interfaces, facilitating public-to-private inter-networking including one of more of the following: (1) Fractional ISDN -- N X 64 Kbps and N X BRI: ranging from 128 Kbps to 44.736 Mbps; (2) Wideband ISDN: Primary Rate ISDN (PRI) @ 23B (64 Kbps) + D (64 Kbps), H0 H11. Section 8. That \u00a7 49-31-67 be repealed. 49-31-67. The wideband fully switched, addressable, supportable, growable, integrated network architecture shall support the open access requirements of the federal Telecommunications Act of 1996. It shall allow alternative resellers to provide transport to customers via these new local fiber rings, while isolating their activities from the critical class 5 switch functions. Users and emerging ISPs (Information Service Providers), and ESPs (Enhanced Service Providers) shall be able to either access or bypass the public network's higher level class 5 and broadband's super 5 switches offerings when communicating locally or regionally with an ASC (Applications Service Center), or globally via an IXC's (Inter Exchange Carrier's), ATP's (Alternative Transport Provider's), or CAP's (Competitive Access Provider's) POP (Point of Presence). Section 9. That \u00a7 49-31-68 be repealed. 49-31-68. The broadband network shall extend the range of fully switched, symmetric, addressable, robust transport services over the fiber network, utilizing SONET rates which increase in multiples of OC-1 (51.84 Mbps) including OC-3 (155.52 Mbps) and OC-12 (622.08 Mbps), while using the broadband ISDN UNI/NNI & SONET interfaces. ATM, STM, or channel switching shall be provided with advanced operational support systems that use expanding network management capabilities to ensure the ongoing support of the network infrastructure when commercially available. This protects the citizens of South Dakota from disrupted or failed communications because of increased traffic loads."}, {"bill_id": 14887, "bill_version_id": 80594, "bill_version": "Enrolled",
