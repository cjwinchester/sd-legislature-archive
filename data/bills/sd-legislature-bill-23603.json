Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of South Dakota: Section 1. That \u00a7 27B-7-37 be AMENDED: 27B-7-37. A county review board may order the involuntary commitment of a person if the review board finds, by clear and convincing evidence supported by written findings of fact and conclusions of law, that the person has a developmental disability, and that due to the development disability, the person poses an immediate danger of physical injury to self or others making it necessary or advisable to receive appropriate supports and services. If the person was charged with a crime of violence, as defined in \u00a7 22-1-2, and the charge was dismissed by a court pursuant to \u00a7 23A-10A-14, the requirement that the person poses an immediate danger of physical injury to self or others is satisfied if the board, after considering any recommendation of the approved facility and any other evidence presented, finds that the person: (1) Committed the offense that was dismissed; (2) Has serious difficulty controlling the person's behavior; and (3) Is likely to commit another crime of violence. If the person is found to meet the criteria for involuntary commitment, the county review board may order the person to be placed under the control and care of the Department of Human Services for placement in appropriate programs. If the person refuses to comply with this order, the board may direct a law enforcement officer to take the person into protective custody."}], "amendments": [{"bill_id": 23603, "document_id": 250018, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/250018.pdf", "legislator_profile_id": 4447, "document_id_instructions": 250020, "document_id_instructions_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/250020.pdf"}], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 23603, "action_date": "2023-01-30T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 246888, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/246888.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 171, "committee_id_action": 1159, "committee_id_assigned": 1160, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 23603, "action_date": "2023-02-03T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 248090, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/248090.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 1160, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 23603, "action_date": "2023-02-03T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 248092, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/248092.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 1160, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 76752, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [4358, 4438, 4409, 4421], "Yea": [4451, 4396, 4405, 4458, 4417, 4418, 4464, 4446, 4366]}}, {"bill_id": 23603, "action_date": "2023-02-06T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 248518, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/248518.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass", "journal_page": 237, "committee_id_action": 1159, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 76820, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [4456, 4441, 4334, 4337, 4459, 4341, 4343, 4344, 4449, 4350, 4351, 4442, 4353, 4354, 4471, 4366, 4368, 4450, 4373, 4374, 4379, 4462, 4383, 4452, 4454, 4384, 4385, 4451, 4388, 4389, 4469, 4392, 4447, 4467, 4396, 4397, 4400, 4440, 4403, 4405, 4408, 4409, 4458, 4455, 4444, 4412, 4463, 4417, 4418, 4464, 4446, 4465, 4470, 4429, 4461], "Nay": [4445, 4333, 4468, 4358, 4365, 4375, 4438, 4443, 4393, 4398, 4437, 4439, 4421], "Excused": [4401, 4406]}}, {"bill_id": 23603, "action_date": "2023-02-07T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 248724, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/248724.pdf", "status_text": "First read in Senate and referred to", "journal_page": 214, "committee_id_action": 1183, "committee_id_assigned": 1176, "result": "N", "vote": {}}]}
