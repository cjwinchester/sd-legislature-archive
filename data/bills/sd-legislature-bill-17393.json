BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA, THE SENATE CONCURRING THEREIN: Section 1. That at the next general election held in the state, the following amendment to Article III, section 5 of the Constitution of the State of South Dakota, as set forth in section 2 of this Joint Resolution, which is hereby agreed to, shall be submitted to the electors of the state for approval. Section 2. That Article III, section 5 of the Constitution, of the State of South Dakota, be amended to read as follows: \u00a7 5. The Legislature shall apportion its membership by dividing the state into as many single-member, legislative districts as there are state senators. House districts shall be established wholly within senatorial districts and shall be either single-member or dual-member districts as the Legislature shall determine. Legislative districts shall consist of compact, contiguous territory and shall have population as nearly equal as is practicable, based on the last preceding federal census. An apportionment shall be made by the Legislature in 1983 and in 1991 2001 , and every ten years after 1991 2001 . Such apportionment shall be accomplished by December first of the year in which the apportionment is required. If any Legislature whose duty it is to make an apportionment shall fail to make the same as herein provided, it shall be the duty of the Supreme Court within ninety days to make such apportionment. However, if any federal or state court invalidates, in whole or in part, an apportionment made by the Legislature, the Legislature, meeting in regular or special session, shall make a new apportionment as prescribed by federal and state constitutional and statutory law or court order."}, {"bill_id": 17393, "bill_version_id": 94455, "bill_version": "Enrolled", "bill_version_date":
