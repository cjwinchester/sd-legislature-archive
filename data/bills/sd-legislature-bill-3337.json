BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 62-7-10 be amended to read as follows: 62-7-10. An employee who claims compensation for an injury shall immediately, or as soon thereafter as practical, notify the employer of the occurrence of the injury. Written notice of the injury shall be provided to the employer no later than three seven business days after its occurrence. The notice need not be in any particular form but must advise the employer of when, where, and how the injury occurred. Failure to give notice as required by this section prohibits a claim for compensation under this title unless the employee or the employee's representative can show: (1) The employer or the employer's representative had actual knowledge of the injury; or (2) The employer was given written notice after the date of the injury and the employee had good cause for failing to give written notice within the three seven business-day period, which determination shall be liberally construed in favor of the employee. Section 2. That \u00a7 62-1-1.1 be amended to read as follows: 62-1-1.1. For purposes of this title only, a health care provider licensed and practicing within the scope of his the licensed profession under Title 36 is a medical practitioner. Section 3. That \u00a7 62-1-1.3 be amended to read as follows: 62-1-1.3. If an employer denies coverage of a claim on the basis that the injury is not compensable under this title due to the provisions of subsection 62-1-1(7)(a), (b), or (c), for any reason under this Title or any reason permissible under Title 58, such injury is presumed to be nonwork related for other insurance purposes, and any other insurer covering bodily injury or disease of the injured employee shall pay according to the policy provisions. If coverage is denied by an insurer without a full explanation of the basis in the insurance policy in relation to the facts or applicable law for denial, the director of the Division of Insurance may determine such denial to be an unfair practice under chapter 58-33. If it is later determined that the injury is compensable under this title, the employer shall immediately reimburse the parties not liable for all payments made, including interest at the category B rate specified in \u00a7 54-3-16."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 3337, "action_date": "2012-01-13T12:30:00-06:00", "document_id": 19392, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/19392.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 45, "committee_id_action": 173, "committee_id_assigned": 169, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 3337, "action_date": "2012-01-25T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 19938, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/19938.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 169, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 3337, "action_date": "2012-01-25T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 20164, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/20164.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to the 41st legislative day", "journal_page": 192, "committee_id_action": 169, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 10526, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [222, 227, 225, 313, 280, 312, 276, 302], "Nay": [268, 271, 244, 245, 221]}}]}
