BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. The Department of Social Services shall conduct a study of why there is a disproportionate number of Native American children placed in foster care in this state. The study shall assess the current situation and explore the potential for returning Native American children to their home, removing financial and other barriers to foster care placement with relatives, and coordinating with tribal governments more effectively. The department shall facilitate this by empowering Native American families, including extended families, to care for their own children safely and permanently whenever possible, by preserving existing family relationships, and by recognizing the importance of sibling and half-sibling relationships. In carrying out this study, the department shall consult with a task force of volunteers who have been appointed by consensus vote of the State-Tribal Relations Committee. The task force shall be comprised of five members of the State-Tribal Relations Committee, and as many as four representatives of the department, and tribal governments are encouraged to participate by appointing one representative each. The task force shall serve in an advisory capacity to the State-Tribal Relations Committee until the study is completed. The department shall report the findings of its study to the State-Tribal Relations Committee by September 30, 2003."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [97012], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 18253, "action_date": "2003-02-03T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 96452, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/96452.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 261, "committee_id_action": 798, "committee_id_assigned": 789, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 18253, "action_date": "2003-02-10T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 96858, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/96858.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to another day", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 789, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 56324, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [2843, 2872, 2888, 2900, 2915, 2933, 2859, 2932], "Excused": [2862], "Nay": [2871, 2896, 2930, 2934]}}, {"bill_id": 18253, "action_date": "2003-02-10T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 96858, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/96858.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 789, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 18253, "action_date": "2003-02-12T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 97045, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/97045.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to 41st legislative day", "journal_page": 400, "committee_id_action": 789, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 54422, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [2843, 2862, 2896, 2900, 2930, 2934], "Yea": [2871, 2872, 2888, 2915, 2933, 2859, 2932]}}, {"bill_id": 18253, "action_date": "2003-02-12T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 97045, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/97045.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 789, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/18253"}
