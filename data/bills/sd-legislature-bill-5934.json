BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That chapter 49-34A be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Terms used in this Act mean: (1) \"Customer-generator,\" any customer of an electricity provider that generates electricity on the customer's side of the billing meter with renewable energy generation; (2) \"Electric utility,\" an electric utility as defined in \u00a7 49-34A-1; (3) \"Rural electric cooperative,\" a rural electric cooperative established in accordance with chapter 47-21; (4) \"Distributed generation,\" any small, modular electricity generator system close to the customer load, connected to the electrical grid, and used to offset electric energy provided by the electric utility to the customer-generator during the applicable billing period; (5) \"Renewable energy generation,\" an electrical energy generation system that uses any of the energy sources specified in \u00a7 49-34A-94. Section 2. That chapter 49-34A be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Each electric utility and rural electric cooperative is subject to the following: (1) Any distributed generation from customer-generators with renewable energy generation that is interconnected and operated in parallel and in compliance with interconnection rules promulgated by the Public Utilities Commission shall be allowed. The rated capacity of the renewable energy generation may not exceed one hundred fifty kilowatts; (2) If a customer-generator generates electricity in excess of the customer-generator's monthly consumption, all such excess energy, expressed in kilowatt hours, shall be carried forward from month-to-month and credited at a ratio of seventy percent against the charged rate of the customer-generator's kilowatt hour consumption; (3) Within sixty days of the end of each calendar year, or within sixty days of when the customer-generator terminates its retail service, the electric utility shall compensate the customer-generator for any accrued excess kilowatt hour credits, at the electric utility's average hourly incremental cost of electricity supply over the most recent calendar year. However, the customer-generator may make a one-time election, in writing, on or before the end of a calendar year, to request that the excess kilowatt hours be rolled over as a credit from month-to-month indefinitely until the customer-generator terminates service with the electric utility, at which time no payment may be required from the electric utility for any remaining excess kilowatt hour credits supplied by the customer-generator; (4) An electric utility or rural electric cooperative shall provide to customer-generators electric service at nondiscriminatory rates that are identical, with respect to rate structure, retail rate components, and any monthly charges, to the rates that a customer-generator would be charged if not a customer-generator, including choice of retail tariff schedules; and (5) An electric utility may not charge a customer-generator any fee or charge, or require additional equipment, insurance, or any other requirement not specifically authorized under this Act or the interconnection rules promulgated by the Public Utilities Commission, unless the fee, charge, or other requirement would apply to other similarly situated customers who are not customer-generators. Section 3. That chapter 49-34A be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: The following interconnection standards and related requirements apply to distributed generation systems: (1) Any distributed generation system shall meet all applicable safety and performance standards as set forth by applicable statute and regulation; (2) The customer-generator shall, at the customer-generator's expense, provide lockable switching equipment capable of isolating the distributed general system from the electric utility's or rural electric cooperative's system; (3) The electric utility or rural electric cooperative is not liable directly or indirectly for any act or omission of the customer-generator that causes loss or injury, including death, to any third party; and (4) The customer-generator shall carry applicable liability insurance, which may be included in homeowner's insurance."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 5934, "action_date": "2014-02-04T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 29776, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/29776.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 273, "committee_id_action": 231, "committee_id_assigned": 232, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 5934, "action_date": "2014-02-13T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 30176, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/30176.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 232, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 5934, "action_date": "2014-02-18T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 30350, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/30350.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 232, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 5934, "action_date": "2014-02-18T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 30461, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/30461.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to the 41st legislative day", "journal_page": 424, "committee_id_action": 232, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 16134, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [527, 522, 524, 466, 439, 500, 515, 514, 485, 457], "Nay": [449, 459], "Excused": [521]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/5934"}
