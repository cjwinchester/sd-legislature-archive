Any violation of this section is a Class 1 misdemeanor. Section 4. That \u00a7 42-8-45.1 be repealed. 42-8-45.1. A law enforcement officer may, without a warrant, arrest a person for a violation of the provisions of \u00a7 42-8-45 if he has probable cause to believe that the person to be arrested has been involved in an accident on the public waters of the state and has violated the provisions of \u00a7 42-8-45 and that the violation occurred prior to or immediately following the accident. Section 5. That \u00a7 42-8-45.2 be repealed. 42-8-45.2.

Such authorized persons, acting on the consent considered to have been given by the person when operating a boat while underway, and any hospital employing such persons, are not liable and may not be held to pay damages to the party from whom the blood sample is withdrawn, if the withdrawal is administered with usual and ordinary care. Section 11. That \u00a7 42-8-45.8 be repealed. 42-8-45.8. To be considered valid under the provisions of this chapter, the withdrawal or chemical analysis shall be performed at the direction of a law enforcement officer having lawfully arrested the person for violation of \u00a7 42-8-45 and the chemical test analysis of the person's breath, if one is performed, shall have been performed according to methods approved by the director of laboratories and by an individual possessing a valid permit issued by the director of laboratories for this purpose. The director of laboratories may approve satisfactory techniques or methods to ascertain the qualifications and competence of individuals to conduct such analysis and issue permits which are subject to termination or revocation at the discretion of the director of laboratories.
