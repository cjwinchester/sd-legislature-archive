No application for disability benefits pursuant to \u00a7 3-12C-812 may be determined until a health care provider has certified to the system that the employee has a disability completed a form providing an evaluation of the member\u2019s diagnosis, complicating conditions, including limitations or restrictions, and the member\u2019s ability to perform the duties required by the member\u2019s employment.

If the member is married, the spouse shall must sign the application and provide a copy of the spouse's current driver license or other picture identification card issued by a government agency or tribe. A member who is married is not required to obtain the signature of the member's spouse if the member submits a completed form, in which the member certifies, under the penalty of perjury, that the member is unable to obtain the signature of the member's spouse because either: (1) The member does not know where the member's spouse is and has made a good faith effort to locate the spouse; or (2) Exceptional circumstances make it inappropriate for the member to obtain the signature of the member's spouse. If the member is unable to obtain the signature of the member's spouse for either reason, the member must elect the sixty percent joint and survivor benefit pursuant to \u00a7 3-12C-1209 and provide documentation to support the assertion of subdivision (1) or (2) of this section."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [263386], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 24945, "action_date": "2024-01-09T12:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 257007, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/257007.pdf", "status_text": "First read in Senate and referred to", "journal_page": 21, "committee_id_action": 1219, "committee_id_assigned": 1218, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 24945, "action_date": "2024-01-24T15:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 260557, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/260557.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 1218, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 24945, "action_date": "2024-01-24T15:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 260559, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/260559.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 1218, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 78821, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [4490, 4536, 4576, 4529, 4479]}}, {"bill_id": 24945, "action_date": "2024-01-24T15:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 260559, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/260559.pdf", "status_text": "Certified uncontested, placed on consent", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 1218, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 24945, "action_date": "2024-01-29T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 262946, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/262946.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass", "journal_page": 191, "committee_id_action": 1219, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 78909, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [4477, 4479, 4480, 4481, 4487, 4490, 4498, 4502, 4507, 4508, 4512, 4515, 4516, 4517, 4523, 4526, 4529, 4536, 4537, 4541, 4547, 4550, 4554, 4558, 4559, 4564, 4567, 4572, 4573, 4574, 4576], "Excused": [4488, 4493, 4501]}}, {"bill_id": 24945, "action_date": "2024-01-30T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 263279, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/263279.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 199, "committee_id_action": 1197, "committee_id_assigned": 1202, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 24945, "action_date": "2024-02-06T15:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 264393, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/264393.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 1, "committee_id_action": 1202, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 24945, "action_date": "2024-02-06T15:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 264394, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/264394.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 1202, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 79310, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [4535, 4543, 4546, 4571, 4476]}}, {"bill_id": 24945, "action_date": "2024-02-06T15:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 264394, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/264394.pdf", "status_text": "Certified uncontested, placed on consent", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 1202, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 24945, "action_date": "2024-02-08T13:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 265058, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/265058.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass", "journal_page": 295, "committee_id_action": 1197, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 79425, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [4472, 4473, 4474, 4476, 4478, 4482, 4483, 4485, 4486, 4489, 4491, 4492, 4494, 4495, 4496, 4499, 4500, 4503, 4504, 4505, 4506, 4509, 4510, 4511, 4513, 4514, 4518, 4519, 4520, 4522, 4524, 4525, 4527, 4528, 4530, 4531, 4532, 4533, 4534, 4535, 4538, 4542, 4543, 4544, 4545, 4546, 4548, 4549, 4551, 4552, 4553, 4556, 4557, 4560, 4561, 4562, 4563, 4565, 4566, 4568, 4569, 4570, 4571, 4575], "Excused": [4475, 4497, 4521, 4540, 4555]}}]}
