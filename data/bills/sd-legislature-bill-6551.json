(1) The calendar year statutory valuation interest rates, \"I\", shall be determined as follows and the results rounded to the nearer one-quarter of one percent: (a) For life insurance, I = .03 + W(R1 - .03) + W (R2 - .09); 2 (b) For single premiums immediate annuities and for annuity benefits involving life contingencies arising from other annuities with cash settlement options and from guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, I = .03 + W(R - .03) where R1 is the lesser of R and .09, R2 is the greater of R and .09, R is the reference interest rate defined in \u00a7\u00a7 58-26-71 to 58-26-74, inclusive, and W is the weighting factor defined in \u00a7\u00a7 58-26-71 to 58-26-74, inclusive; (c) For other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, valued on an issue year basis, except as stated in subdivision (b), the formula for life insurance stated in subdivision (a) applies to annuities and guaranteed interest contracts with guarantee durations in excess of ten years and the formula for single premium immediate annuities stated in subdivision (b) applies to annuities and guaranteed interest contracts with guarantee duration of ten years or less; (d) For other annuities with no cash settlement options and for guaranteed interest contracts with no cash settlement options, the formula for single premium immediate annuities stated in subdivision (b) applies; (e) For other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, valued on a change in fund basis, the formula for single premium immediate annuities stated in subdivision (b) applies. (2) However, if the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for any life insurance policies issued in any calendar year determined without reference to this sentence differs from the corresponding actual rate for similar policies issued in the immediately preceding calendar year by less than one-half of one percent, the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for life insurance policies is equal to the corresponding actual rate for the immediately preceding calendar year. For purposes of applying the immediately preceding sentence, the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for life insurance policies issued in a calendar year shall be determined for 1980, using the reference interest rate defined in 1979, and shall be determined for each subsequent calendar year regardless of when \u00a7\u00a7 58-15-43.1 to 58-15-43.11, inclusive, became operative. Section 16. That \u00a7 58-26-74 be amended to read as follows: 58-26-74.

Section 17. That \u00a7 58-26-75 be amended to read as follows: 58-26-75.

The modified net premiums for any policy shall be the uniform percentage of the respective contract premiums for the benefits such that the present value, at the date of issue of the policy, of all the modified net premiums shall be equal to the sum of the then present value of the benefits provided for by the policy and the excess of subdivision (1) over subdivision (2) as follows: (1) A net level annual premium equal to the present value, at the date of issue, of the benefits provided for after the first policy year, divided by the present value, at the date of issue, of an annuity of one per annum payable on the first and each subsequent anniversary of a policy on which a premium falls due. However, the net level annual premium may not exceed the net level annual premium on the nineteen year premium whole life plan for insurance of the same amount at an age one year higher than the age at issue of the policy; (2) A net one year term premium for the benefits provided for in the first policy year. Any life insurance policy issued on or after January 1, 1986, for which the contract premium in the first policy year exceeds that of the second year and for which no comparable additional benefit is provided in the first year for the excess and which provides an endowment benefit or a cash surrender value or a combination thereof in an amount greater than the excess premium, the reserve according to the commissioners' reserve valuation method as of any policy anniversary occurring on or before the assumed ending date defined in this chapter as the first policy anniversary on which the sum of any endowment benefit and any cash surrender value then available is greater than the excess premium shall, except as otherwise provided in \u00a7\u00a7 58-26-81 and 58-26-82, be the greater of the reserve as of the policy anniversary calculated as described in the preceding paragraph and the reserve as of the policy anniversary calculated as described in that paragraph, but with (i) the value defined in subdivision (1) of that paragraph being reduced by fifteen percent of the amount of excess first year premium, (ii) all present values of benefits and premiums being determined without reference to premiums or benefits provided for by the policy after the assumed ending date, (iii) the policy being assumed to mature on the date as an endowment, and (iv) the cash surrender value provided on the date being considered as an endowment benefit. In making the above comparison, the mortality and interest bases stated in \u00a7\u00a7 58-26-56 to 58-26-63, inclusive, and \u00a7\u00a7 58-26-71 to 58-26-74, inclusive, shall be used.

(1) The calendar year statutory valuation interest rates, \"I\", shall be determined as follows and the results rounded to the nearer one-quarter of one percent: (a) For life insurance, I = .03 + W(R1 - .03) + W (R2 - .09); 2 (b) For single premiums immediate annuities and for annuity benefits involving life contingencies arising from other annuities with cash settlement options and from guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, I = .03 + W(R - .03) where R1 is the lesser of R and .09, R2 is the greater of R and .09, R is the reference interest rate defined in \u00a7\u00a7 58-26-71 to 58-26-74, inclusive, and W is the weighting factor defined in \u00a7\u00a7 58-26-71 to 58-26-74, inclusive; (c) For other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, valued on an issue year basis, except as stated in subdivision (b), the formula for life insurance stated in subdivision (a) applies to annuities and guaranteed interest contracts with guarantee durations in excess of ten years and the formula for single premium immediate annuities stated in subdivision (b) applies to annuities and guaranteed interest contracts with guarantee duration of ten years or less; (d) For other annuities with no cash settlement options and for guaranteed interest contracts with no cash settlement options, the formula for single premium immediate annuities stated in subdivision (b) applies; (e) For other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, valued on a change in fund basis, the formula for single premium immediate annuities stated in subdivision (b) applies. (2) However, if the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for any life insurance policies issued in any calendar year determined without reference to this sentence differs from the corresponding actual rate for similar policies issued in the immediately preceding calendar year by less than one-half of one percent, the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for life insurance policies is equal to the corresponding actual rate for the immediately preceding calendar year. For purposes of applying the immediately preceding sentence, the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for life insurance policies issued in a calendar year shall be determined for 1980, using the reference interest rate defined in 1979, and shall be determined for each subsequent calendar year regardless of when \u00a7\u00a7 58-15-43.1 to 58-15-43.11, inclusive, became operative. Section 16. That \u00a7 58-26-74 be amended to read as follows: 58-26-74.

The modified net premiums for any policy shall be the uniform percentage of the respective contract premiums for the benefits such that the present value, at the date of issue of the policy, of all the modified net premiums shall be equal to the sum of the then present value of the benefits provided for by the policy and the excess of subdivision (1) over subdivision (2) as follows: (1) A net level annual premium equal to the present value, at the date of issue, of the benefits provided for after the first policy year, divided by the present value, at the date of issue, of an annuity of one per annum payable on the first and each subsequent anniversary of a policy on which a premium falls due. However, the net level annual premium may not exceed the net level annual premium on the nineteen year premium whole life plan for insurance of the same amount at an age one year higher than the age at issue of the policy; (2) A net one year term premium for the benefits provided for in the first policy year. Any life insurance policy issued on or after January 1, 1986, for which the contract premium in the first policy year exceeds that of the second year and for which no comparable additional benefit is provided in the first year for the excess and which provides an endowment benefit or a cash surrender value or a combination thereof in an amount greater than the excess premium, the reserve according to the commissioners' reserve valuation method as of any policy anniversary occurring on or before the assumed ending date defined in this chapter as the first policy anniversary on which the sum of any endowment benefit and any cash surrender value then available is greater than the excess premium shall, except as otherwise provided in \u00a7\u00a7 58-26-81 and 58-26-82, be the greater of the reserve as of the policy anniversary calculated as described in the preceding paragraph and the reserve as of the policy anniversary calculated as described in that paragraph, but with (i) the value defined in subdivision (1) of that paragraph being reduced by fifteen percent of the amount of excess first year premium, (ii) all present values of benefits and premiums being determined without reference to premiums or benefits provided for by the policy after the assumed ending date, (iii) the policy being assumed to mature on the date as an endowment, and (iv) the cash surrender value provided on the date being considered as an endowment benefit. In making the above comparison, the mortality and interest bases stated in \u00a7\u00a7 58-26-56 to 58-26-63, inclusive, and \u00a7\u00a7 58-26-71 to 58-26-74, inclusive, shall be used. Reserves according to the commissioners' reserve valuation method for: (i) life insurance policies providing for varying amount of insurance or requiring the payment of varying premiums; (ii) group annuity and pure endowment contracts purchased under a retirement plan or plan of deferred compensation, established or maintained by an employer, including a partnership or sole proprietorship, or by an employee organization, or by both, other than a plan providing individual retirement accounts or individual retirement annuities under section 408 of the Internal Revenue Code, as of January 1, 1995; (iii) disability and accidental death benefits in all policies and contracts; and (iv) all other benefits, except life insurance and endowment benefits in life insurance policies and benefits provided by all other annuity and pure endowment contracts, shall be calculated by a method consistent with the principles of the preceding paragraphs of this section. Section 18. That \u00a7 58-26-77 be amended to read as follows: 58-26-77. No company's aggregate reserves for all life insurance policies, excluding disability and accidental death benefits, issued on or after July 1, 1995, may be less than the aggregate reserves calculated in accordance with the methods set forth in \u00a7\u00a7 58-26-75, 58-26-76, 58-26-81, 58-26-82, and 58-26-83 and the mortality table or tables and rate or rates of interest used in calculating nonforfeiture benefits for the policies. The aggregate reserves for all policies, contracts, and benefits may not be less than the aggregate reserves determined by the qualified appointed actuary to be necessary to give the opinion required by \u00a7\u00a7 58-26-46 to 58-26-55, inclusive. Section 19. That \u00a7 58-26-78 be amended to read as follows: 58-26-78. Reserves for all policies and contracts issued prior to July 1, 1995, may be calculated, at the option of the company, according to any standards which produce greater aggregate reserves for all the policies and contracts than the minimum reserves required by the laws in effect immediately prior to July 1, 1995. Section 20. That \u00a7 58-26-79 be amended to read as follows: 58-26-79. Reserves for any category of policies, contracts, or benefits as established by the director, issued on or after July 1, 1995, may be calculated, at the option of the company, according to any standards which produce greater aggregate reserves for any category than those calculated according to the minimum standard provided in this chapter, but the rate or rates of interest used for policies and contracts, other than annuity and pure endowment contracts, may not be higher greater than the corresponding rate or rates of interest used in calculating any nonforfeiture benefits provided therein in the policies or contracts. Section 21. That \u00a7 58-26-80 be amended to read as follows: 58-26-80. Any company which adopts any standard of valuation producing greater aggregate reserves than those calculated according to the minimum standard provided in this chapter may, with the approval of the director, adopt any lower standard of valuation, but not lower than the minimum provided by this chapter. However, for the purposes of this section and \u00a7\u00a7 58-26-78 and 58-26-79, the holding of additional reserves previously determined by a qualified the appointed actuary to be necessary to render the opinion required by \u00a7\u00a7 58-26-46 to 58-26-55, inclusive, is not considered to be the adoption of a higher standard of valuation. Section 22. That \u00a7 58-26-81 be amended to read as follows: 58-26-81. If in any contract year the gross premium charged by any life insurance company on any policy or contract is less than the valuation net premium for the policy or contract calculated by the method used in calculating the reserve thereon but using the minimum valuation standards of mortality and rate of interest, the minimum reserve required for the policy or contract is the greater of either the reserve calculated according to the mortality table, rate of interest, and method actually used for the policy or contract, or the reserve calculated by the method actually used for the policy or contract but using the minimum valuation standards of mortality and rate of interest and replacing the valuation net premium by the actual gross premium in each contract year for which the valuation net premium exceeds the actual gross premium. The minimum valuation standards of mortality and rate of interest referred to in this section and \u00a7 58-26-82 are those standards stated in \u00a7\u00a7 58-26-56 to 58-26-63, inclusive, and \u00a7\u00a7 58-26-71 to 58-26-74, inclusive.

The interest rates used in determining the minimum standard for the valuation of all life insurance policies issued in a particular calendar year, on or after the operative date of \u00a7\u00a7 58-15-43.1 to 58-15-43.11, inclusive; all individual annuity and pure endowment contracts issued in a particular calendar year on or after January 1, 1983; all annuities and pure endowments purchased in a particular calendar year on or after January 1, 1983, under group annuity and pure endowment contracts; and the net increase, if any, in a particular calendar year after January 1, 1983, in amounts held under guaranteed interest contracts; shall be the calendar year statutory valuation interest rates as defined in this section. (1) The calendar year statutory valuation interest rates, \"I\", shall be determined as follows and the results rounded to the nearer one-quarter of one percent: (a) For life insurance, I = .03 + W(R1 - .03) + W (R2 - .09); 2 (b) For single premiums immediate annuities and for annuity benefits involving life contingencies arising from other annuities with cash settlement options and from guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, I = .03 + W(R - .03) where R1 is the lesser of R and .09, R2 is the greater of R and .09, R is the reference interest rate defined in \u00a7\u00a7 58-26-71 to 58-26-74, inclusive, and W is the weighting factor defined in \u00a7\u00a7 58-26-71 to 58-26-74, inclusive; (c) For other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, valued on an issue year basis, except as stated in subdivision (b), the formula for life insurance stated in subdivision (a) applies to annuities and guaranteed interest contracts with guarantee durations in excess of ten years and the formula for single premium immediate annuities stated in subdivision (b) applies to annuities and guaranteed interest contracts with guarantee duration of ten years or less; (d) For other annuities with no cash settlement options and for guaranteed interest contracts with no cash settlement options, the formula for single premium immediate annuities stated in subdivision (b) applies; (e) For other annuities with cash settlement options and guaranteed interest contracts with cash settlement options, valued on a change in fund basis, the formula for single premium immediate annuities stated in subdivision (b) applies. (2) However, if the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for any life insurance policies issued in any calendar year determined without reference to this sentence differs from the corresponding actual rate for similar policies issued in the immediately preceding calendar year by less than one-half of one percent, the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for life insurance policies is equal to the corresponding actual rate for the immediately preceding calendar year. For purposes of applying the immediately preceding sentence, the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for life insurance policies issued in a calendar year shall be determined for 1980, using the reference interest rate defined in 1979, and shall be determined for each subsequent calendar year regardless of when \u00a7\u00a7 58-15-43.1 to 58-15-43.11, inclusive, became operative. Section 16. That \u00a7 58-26-74 be amended to read as follows: 58-26-74. If the Monthly Average of the Composite Yield on Seasoned Corporate Bonds is no longer published by Moody's Investors Service, Inc., or if the National Association of Insurance Commissioners NAIC determines that the Monthly Average of the Composite Yield on Seasoned Corporate Bonds as published by Moody's Investors Service, Inc., is no longer appropriate for the determination of the reference interest rate, then an alternative method for determination of the reference interest rate, which is adopted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners NAIC and approved by rules promulgated pursuant to chapter 1-26 by the director, may be substituted. Section 17. That \u00a7 58-26-75 be amended to read as follows: 58-26-75. Except as otherwise provided in \u00a7\u00a7 58-26-76, 58-26-81, 58-26-82, and 58-26-84, reserves according to the commissioners' reserve valuation method, for the life insurance and endowment benefits of policies providing for a uniform amount of insurance and requiring the payment of uniform premiums shall be the excess, if any, of the present value, at the date of valuation, of future guaranteed benefits provided for by the policies, over the then present value of any future modified net premiums of the policies. The modified net premiums for any policy shall be the uniform percentage of the respective contract premiums for the benefits such that the present value, at the date of issue of the policy, of all the modified net premiums shall be equal to the sum of the then present value of the benefits provided for by the policy and the excess of subdivision (1) over subdivision (2) as follows: (1) A net level annual premium equal to the present value, at the date of issue, of the benefits provided for after the first policy year, divided by the present value, at the date of issue, of an annuity of one per annum payable on the first and each subsequent anniversary of a policy on which a premium falls due. However, the net level annual premium may not exceed the net level annual premium on the nineteen year premium whole life plan for insurance of the same amount at an age one year higher than the age at issue of the policy; (2) A net one year term premium for the benefits provided for in the first policy year. Any life insurance policy issued on or after January 1, 1986, for which the contract premium in the first policy year exceeds that of the second year and for which no comparable additional benefit is provided in the first year for the excess and which provides an endowment benefit or a cash surrender value or a combination thereof in an amount greater than the excess premium, the reserve according to the commissioners' reserve valuation method as of any policy anniversary occurring on or before the assumed ending date defined in this chapter as the first policy anniversary on which the sum of any endowment benefit and any cash surrender value then available is greater than the excess premium shall, except as otherwise provided in \u00a7\u00a7 58-26-81 and 58-26-82, be the greater of the reserve as of the policy anniversary calculated as described in the preceding paragraph and the reserve as of the policy anniversary calculated as described in that paragraph, but with (i) the value defined in subdivision (1) of that paragraph being reduced by fifteen percent of the amount of excess first year premium, (ii) all present values of benefits and premiums being determined without reference to premiums or benefits provided for by the policy after the assumed ending date, (iii) the policy being assumed to mature on the date as an endowment, and (iv) the cash surrender value provided on the date being considered as an endowment benefit. In making the above comparison, the mortality and interest bases stated in \u00a7\u00a7 58-26-56 to 58-26-63, inclusive, and \u00a7\u00a7 58-26-71 to 58-26-74, inclusive, shall be used. Reserves according to the commissioners' reserve valuation method for: (i) life insurance policies providing for varying amount of insurance or requiring the payment of varying premiums; (ii) group annuity and pure endowment contracts purchased under a retirement plan or plan of deferred compensation, established or maintained by an employer, including a partnership or sole proprietorship, or by an employee organization, or by both, other than a plan providing individual retirement accounts or individual retirement annuities under section 408 of the Internal Revenue Code, as of January 1, 1995; (iii) disability and accidental death benefits in all policies and contracts; and (iv) all other benefits, except life insurance and endowment benefits in life insurance policies and benefits provided by all other annuity and pure endowment contracts, shall be calculated by a method consistent with the principles of the preceding paragraphs of this section. Section 18. That \u00a7 58-26-77 be amended to read as follows: 58-26-77. No company's aggregate reserves for all life insurance policies, excluding disability and accidental death benefits, issued on or after July 1, 1995, may be less than the aggregate reserves calculated in accordance with the methods set forth in \u00a7\u00a7 58-26-75, 58-26-76, 58-26-81, 58-26-82, and 58-26-83 and the mortality table or tables and rate or rates of interest used in calculating nonforfeiture benefits for the policies. The aggregate reserves for all policies, contracts, and benefits may not be less than the aggregate reserves determined by the qualified appointed actuary to be necessary to give the opinion required by \u00a7\u00a7 58-26-46 to 58- 26-55, inclusive. Section 19. That \u00a7 58-26-78 be amended to read as follows: 58-26-78. Reserves for all policies and contracts issued prior to July 1, 1995, may be calculated, at the option of the company, according to any standards which produce greater aggregate reserves for all the policies and contracts than the minimum reserves required by the laws in effect immediately prior to July 1, 1995. Section 20. That \u00a7 58-26-79 be amended to read as follows: 58-26-79. Reserves for any category of policies, contracts, or benefits as established by the director, issued on or after July 1, 1995, may be calculated, at the option of the company, according to any standards which produce greater aggregate reserves for any category than those calculated according to the minimum standard provided in this chapter, but the rate or rates of interest used for policies and contracts, other than annuity and pure endowment contracts, may not be higher greater than the corresponding rate or rates of interest used in calculating any nonforfeiture benefits provided therein in the policies or contracts. Section 21. That \u00a7 58-26-80 be amended to read as follows: 58-26-80. Any company which adopts any standard of valuation producing greater aggregate reserves than those calculated according to the minimum standard provided in this chapter may, with the approval of the director, adopt any lower standard of valuation, but not lower than the minimum provided by this chapter. However, for the purposes of this section and \u00a7\u00a7 58-26-78 and 58-26-79, the holding of additional reserves previously determined by a qualified the appointed actuary to be necessary to render the opinion required by \u00a7\u00a7 58-26-46 to 58-26-55, inclusive, is not considered to be the adoption of a higher standard of valuation. Section 22. That \u00a7 58-26-81 be amended to read as follows: 58-26-81. If in any contract year the gross premium charged by any life insurance company on any policy or contract is less than the valuation net premium for the policy or contract calculated by the method used in calculating the reserve thereon but using the minimum valuation standards of mortality and rate of interest, the minimum reserve required for the policy or contract is the greater of either the reserve calculated according to the mortality table, rate of interest, and method actually used for the policy or contract, or the reserve calculated by the method actually used for the policy or contract but using the minimum valuation standards of mortality and rate of interest and replacing the valuation net premium by the actual gross premium in each contract year for which the valuation net premium exceeds the actual gross premium. The minimum valuation standards of mortality and rate of interest referred to in this section and \u00a7 58-26-82 are those standards stated in \u00a7\u00a7 58-26-56 to 58-26-63, inclusive, and \u00a7\u00a7 58-26-71 to 58-26-74, inclusive.

If the director approves by regulation any commissioner's standard industrial mortality table adopted by the national association of insurance commissioners for use in determining the minimum nonforfeiture standard for policies issued on or after the operative date of the valuation manual then that minimum nonforfeiture standard supersedes the minimum nonforfeiture standard provided by the valuation manual. Section 42. That \u00a7 58-15-43.9 be amended to read as follows: 58-15-43.9. The nonforfeiture interest rate is: (1) For policies issued prior to the operative date of the valuation manual, the nonforfeiture interest rate per annum for any policy issued in a particular calendar year is equal to one hundred twenty-five percent of the calendar year statutory valuation interest rate for the policy as defined in the standard valuation law, rounded to the nearer one quarter of one percent, provided that the nonforfeiture rate may not be less than four percent; (2) For policies issued on or after the operative date of the valuation manual the forfeiture interest rate per annum for any policy issued in a particular calendar year is provided by the valuation manual."}, {"bill_id": 6551, "bill_version_id": 36191, "bill_version": "Enrolled", "bill_version_date":
