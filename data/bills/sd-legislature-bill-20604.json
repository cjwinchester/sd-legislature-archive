BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. There is hereby established the South Dakota made energy savings fund and the South Dakota made energy savings program to be administered by the Department of Tourism and State Development. The purpose of the program is to provide a rebate to any person who intends to purchase and install a corn stove heating system. The corn stove heating system shall be the primary heating source for the home or facility. Any application for a rebate that is submitted after all the available funds have been obligated is denied. Section 2. Terms used in this Act mean: (1) \"Corn stove heating system,\" any private home or commercial facility that utilizes corn as a fuel for heating purposes; (2) \"Department,\" the Department of Tourism and State Development; (3) \"Person,\" any individual, firm, copartnership, joint venture, association, limited liability company, limited liability partnership, corporation, estate, trust, business trust, receiver, unit of government, or political subdivision of any state; (4) \"Project,\" the purchase installation of a corn stove heating system as the primary heating source for a private home or commercial facility; (5) \"Project cost,\" the amount of money, credits, property, or other money's worth for a project incurred and paid after July 1, 2006, for a project; (6) \"Secretary,\" the secretary of the Department of Tourism and State Development. Section 3. Any person who is a South Dakota resident may apply for and obtain a rebate of five hundred dollars for the purchase and installation of a corn stove heating system. However, if the person has a countable income at or below one hundred fifty percent of the federal poverty level, as updated annually by the Department of Social Services in administrative rules promulgated pursuant to chapter 1-26, the person may apply for and obtain a rebate of one thousand dollars. Section 4. The rebate for a corn stove heating system pertains only to project costs incurred and paid after July 1, 2006, and within eighteen months of the approval of the application required by this Act. No rebate may be made unless the person has obtained prior approval from the secretary for a rebate as set forth in this Act. Section 5. Any person desiring to claim a rebate pursuant to this Act shall apply for a rebate from the secretary at least thirty days prior to the purchase and installation date of the corn stove heating system. The application for a rebate shall be submitted on a form prescribed by the secretary. Upon approval of the application, the secretary shall issue a rebate entitling the applicant to submit rebate claims as provided by this Act. Section 6. Any claim for rebate shall be submitted on forms prescribed by the secretary and shall be supported by such documentation as the secretary may require. The secretary may deny any claim where the claimant has failed to provide information or documentation requested or considered necessary by the secretary to determine the validity of the claim. Section 7. If any claim has been fraudulently presented or supported as to any item in the claim, or if the claimant fails to meet all the conditions of this Act, then the claim may be rejected in its entirety and all sums previously rebated to the claimant shall constitute a debt to the state and a lien in favor of the state upon all property and rights to property whether real or personal belonging to the claimant and may be recovered in an action of debt. Section 8. Any person, aggrieved by the denial in whole or in part of a rebate claimed under this Act, may, within thirty days after service of the notice of such denial by the secretary, demand a hearing, upon notice, before the secretary. The hearing shall be conducted pursuant to chapter 1-26. Section 9. Any person aggrieved by a decision of the secretary under this Act, may, within thirty days of receipt of written notice of the secretary's decision, make written application to the secretary for a hearing to be conducted pursuant to chapter 1-26. Hearings are to be conducted and appeals taken pursuant to the provisions of chapters 1-26 and 1-26D. A copy of the hearing examiner's proposed decision, findings of fact, and conclusions of law shall be served on all parties when furnished to the secretary. If the secretary, pursuant to chapter 1-26D, accepts the final decision of the hearing examiner, no appeal from a final decision of the secretary upon any additional tax to be paid may be taken unless any amount ordered paid by the secretary is paid or a bond filed to insure payment of the amount. However, if the final decision of the secretary, pursuant to chapter 1-26D, rejects or modifies the decision of the hearing examiner regarding the amount due, an appeal may be taken without payment of the amount ordered to be paid and without filing of a bond. If the secretary's decision is affirmed by the circuit court, no appeal may be taken unless any amount ordered to be paid by the secretary is paid or a bond is filed to insure payment of such amount. Section 10. The secretary may promulgate rules, pursuant to chapter 1-26, concerning the procedures for filing rebate claims and the requirements necessary to qualify for a rebate. Section 11. There is hereby appropriated from the general fund the sum of fifty thousand dollars ($ 50,000 ), or so much thereof as may be necessary, to the Department of Tourism and State Development for the purpose of funding a rebate program for the South Dakota made energy savings program. Section 12. The secretary of the Department of Tourism and State Development shall approve vouchers and the state auditor shall draw warrants to pay expenditures authorized by this Act. Section 13. Any amounts appropriated in this Act not lawfully expended or obligated by June 30, 2009, shall revert in accordance with \u00a7 4-8-21."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 20604, "action_date": "2006-01-23T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 107070, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/107070.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 185, "committee_id_action": 893, "committee_id_assigned": 888, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 20604, "action_date": "2006-01-30T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 107508, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/107508.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 888, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 20604, "action_date": "2006-01-30T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 107508, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/107508.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to another day", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 888, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 20604, "action_date": "2006-02-01T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 107707, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/107707.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 888, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 20604, "action_date": "2006-02-03T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 107892, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/107892.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 888, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 20604, "action_date": "2006-02-03T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 107892, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/107892.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass,", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 888, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "F", "vote": {"vote_id": 64109, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [3373, 3382, 3387, 3393, 3417, 3426, 3427, 3434, 3442, 3378, 3443], "Yea": [3385, 3398]}}, {"bill_id": 20604, "action_date": "2006-02-03T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 107892, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/107892.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to 36th legislative day", "journal_page": 364, "committee_id_action": 888, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 64110, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [3373, 3382, 3387, 3393, 3398, 3417, 3426, 3427, 3434, 3442, 3378, 3443], "Nay": [3385]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/20604"}
