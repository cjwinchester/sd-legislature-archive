The term, telecommunications service, does not include the provision of terminal equipment used to originate or terminate such service. The term, telecommunications service, does not include specialized mobile radio service, private mobile radio service, one-way cable television service, or two-way cable system subscriber interaction that may be required for the selection of video or other programing services.

Section 5. If any telecommunications company fails to make the report required by section 1 of this Act, on or before April fifteenth of each year, the department in its discretion may add twenty-five percent to the assessable value of the property of the company. Section 6. All property, real and personal, which is actually and necessarily used in providing telecommunications service in this state, and which belongs to any telecommunications company in this state which is not subject to the provisions of chapter 10- 33 shall be assessed for the purpose of taxation by the department, and not otherwise. Section 7. The department shall assess the property of each telecommunications company on the fifth day of July of each year. In making the assessment, the department shall consider all the reports, facts, information filed, with any other information obtainable, concerning the value of the property of each telecommunications company and may add any property omitted from the return of any company.

The Public Utilities Commission may inspect the books, records, and property of each company and shall make this information available to the department upon request. Section 9. For the purpose of determining the fair market value of the property of any telecommunications company, the department shall take into consideration the cost approach, the market approach, and the income approach to appraisal. In the market approach, the department shall consider the actual or market value of the shares of stock outstanding, the actual or market value of all bonds outstanding, and all other indebtedness as may be applicable for operating the company.

After the assessment is made, the department shall give notice by mail to the officers of each telecommunications company making return to the department, setting out the assessment and fixing a date at least ten days in advance when the representatives of any telecommunications company, so desiring, may appear before the secretary of revenue and be heard in all matters relating to the correctness of the assessment of the property of the company.
