BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 13-28-40 be amended to read as follows: 13-28-40. An enrollment options program is established to enable any South Dakota kindergarten through twelfth grade student to attend any public school that serves the student's grade level in any South Dakota school district, subject to the provisions in \u00a7 \u00a7 13-28-40 to 13-28-47, inclusive , and to the provisions of this Act . For purposes of determining state aid to education as it relates to the provisions of \u00a7 \u00a7 13-28-40 to 13-28-47, inclusive, and to the provisions of this Act, general enrollment average daily membership as defined in \u00a7 13-13-10.1 is used to compute foundation aid and resident average daily membership as defined in \u00a7 13-37-35 is used to determine funding for special education. Section 2. That \u00a7 13-28-43 be amended to read as follows: 13-28-43. A student's parent or legal guardian who wishes to enroll the student, or an emancipated student who wishes to enroll, under the provisions of \u00a7 \u00a7 13-28-40 to 13-28-47, inclusive , and the provisions of this Act , in a South Dakota school district other than the resident district , in a voucher school established pursuant to this Act, or in a school within the resident district other than the school to which the student has been assigned shall apply on forms provided by the Department of Education and Cultural Affairs. The school board or the board's designee of the district in which the student desires to enroll or the board of directors of a voucher school in which the student wishes to enroll shall approve or disapprove the application and shall notify the applicant and the resident board, if applicable, of its decision within five days of the decision. The district or voucher school in which the student desires to enroll shall review the applications in the order received. Intradistrict transfer applications may be accepted and acted upon at any time at the board's discretion if the policies on which the transfer decisions are based are consistent with the other requirements of \u00a7 \u00a7 13-28-40 to 13-28-47, inclusive , and the provisions of this Act . An application may be withdrawn by the applicant prior to the approval of the request and upon notification of the district to which the student applied. Once approved by the district or voucher school in which the student wishes to enroll, the approved application serves as the applicant's notice of intent to enroll in the nonresident district or desired school during the school year and obligates the student to attend school in the nonresident district or desired school during the school year, unless the affected school board or boards agree in writing to allow the student to transfer back to the resident district or assigned school, or unless the parents, guardians, or emancipated student change residence to another district. Once enrolled in a nonresident district or nonassigned school, the student may remain enrolled and is not required to resubmit annual applications. Section 3. That chapter 13-28 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: The parent or guardian of any kindergarten through twelfth grade student who desires to enroll in a proposed or existing voucher school may request and receive from the Department of Education and Cultural Affairs a nonsectarian voucher to be redeemed as provided in this Act. The department shall issue the voucher within thirty days after the request was received. The amount of the voucher is three thousand six hundred five dollars as of July 1, 2000. This amount represents the per student allocation as defined in \u00a7 13-13-10.1 and adjusted for large school districts as of July 1, 2000.

Each student at the time of enrollment shall present the voucher to the voucher school in which the student is to be enrolled. The voucher school may redeem the voucher with the department for payment, and the department shall pay the school the amount of the voucher. If the student is not enrolled in the voucher school for the entire school year, the amount of the voucher payment made to the school shall be pro-rated based on the portion of the school year for which the student was enrolled. The issuance or payment of a voucher pursuant to this section does not limit, alter, or in any way restrict the amount of state aid to education to which the student's resident school district and nonresident school district are entitled. State aid for each school district shall be calculated as provided in this title. However, no student who is enrolled in a voucher school created pursuant to this Act may be counted as part of the general enrollment average daily membership as defined in \u00a7 13-13-10.1 in either the student's resident or nonresident school district.

The nonresident district or voucher school shall award a diploma to a nonresident student only if the student satisfactorily meets its graduation requirements. Section 7.

However, no student who is enrolled in a voucher school created pursuant to this Act may be counted as part of the general enrollment average daily membership as defined in \u00a7 13-13-10.1 in either the student's resident or nonresident school district. Section 4. That \u00a7 13-28-44 be amended to read as follows: 13-28-44.

The board shall adopt standards through official board action, set them forth in writing, and make them available to any individual upon receiving an oral or written request. Standards may define the capacity of a program, class, grade level, and school building operated by the board and the pupil/teacher ratio. Discrimination based on race, gender, religious affiliation, or disability is prohibited. If two or more children from a family residing in the same household must enroll in different school districts as the result of a board's denial of an application to transfer from a resident district or to enroll in a nonresident district or a voucher school under the provisions of \u00a7 \u00a7 13-28-40 to 13-28-47, inclusive, and the provisions of this Act, neither the resident board nor the nonresident board may deny the application. The decision of a local school board or a voucher school regarding a student's application for open enrollment or a request to return to the resident district under the provisions of \u00a7 \u00a7 13-28-40 to 13-28-47, inclusive, or the provisions of this Act is subject to de novo appeal under the provisions of chapter 13-46. The Department of Education and Cultural Affairs may promulgate rules pursuant to chapter 1-26 specifying procedural and administrative requirements for the implementation of the open enrollment program and related transfers and enrollments under the provisions of \u00a7 \u00a7 13-28-40 to 13-28-47, inclusive, and the provisions of this Act .

The parent or guardian of a student who has been accepted for transfer is responsible for transporting the student to school in the receiving district or to the voucher school without reimbursement. Either the district of residence or The resident district, the receiving district , or the voucher school may provide transportation to students approved for transfer. The provisions of \u00a7 13-29-4 do not apply when transporting students enrolled under the provisions of \u00a7 \u00a7 13-28-40 to 13-28-47 , inclusive, or the provisions of this Act . The resident district, the receiving district , or the voucher school may charge a reasonable fee if the student elects to use the transportation services offered by the receiving district or the voucher school . Section 6. That \u00a7 13-28-46 be amended to read as follows: 13-28-46. A school district shall accept credits for any course completed in any other accredited school district or voucher school as the result of a transfer under \u00a7 \u00a7 13-28-40 to 13-28-47, inclusive , or the provisions of this Act . The nonresident district or voucher school shall award a diploma to a nonresident student only if the student satisfactorily meets its graduation requirements. Section 7. That chapter 13-28 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: The parents or guardians of a group of at least twenty students who are eligible to apply for admission to a voucher school pursuant to section 14 of this Act may apply to the Department of Education and Cultural affairs for permission to establish a voucher school in South Dakota. The number of voucher schools in a district and in the state is not limited. Once established as provided in this Act, the voucher school may accept additional open enrollment students. Section 8. That chapter 13-28 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Each voucher school shall develop and adhere to measurable student achievement goals and remain accountable in accordance with an agreement between the school and the department authorizing the establishment of the school. In return for this accountability, a voucher school is exempt from all statutes and rules applicable to a school, a school board, or a school district, except as provided in this Act. Voucher schools are subject to the same requirements for academic achievement testing as other public schools pursuant to \u00a7 13-3-55. If the average academic achievement test scores at a voucher school for two consecutive years are not in the highest twenty-five percent of the academic achievement test scores for schools in South Dakota, the school is ineligible for voucher funding during the next academic year unless the Department of Education and Cultural Affairs has granted a waiver based on the composition or purposes of the school. No voucher school that has been denied voucher funding based on achievement test scores pursuant to this section may be reorganized under a different name solely for purposes of receiving voucher funding unless the department determines that a substantial change has occurred or will occur that is likely to improve the school's performance. The department shall promulgate rules pursuant to chapter 1-26 to establish methods for determining a voucher school's average academic achievement test scores and methods for comparison with test scores in other schools. The rules shall include criteria for granting a waiver, based on the composition or purposes of the school, from the revocation of a school's voucher funding and procedures required for requesting and obtaining a waiver.

No voucher school may charge tuition. A voucher school may accept any lawful gift, grant, donation, or other financial assistance. The gift, grant, donation, or other financial assistance shall be used in accordance with terms and conditions specified by the donor and may not be contrary to the terms of the agreement under which the voucher school was established.
