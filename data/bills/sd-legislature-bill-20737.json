BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 7-18A-15.1 be amended to read as follows: 7-18A-15.1. Any legislative decision of a board of county commissioners is subject to the referendum process. A legislative decision is one that enacts a permanent law or lays down a rule of conduct or course of policy for the guidance of citizens or their officers. Any matter of a permanent or general character is a legislative decision. The approval or disapproval of any conditional use request or variance request is a legislative decision, including any conditional use request or variance request concerning a concentrated animal feeding operation as provided in \u00a7 11-2-17.3. No administrative decision of a governing body is subject to the referendum process, unless specifically authorized by this code. An administrative decision is one that merely puts into execution a plan already adopted by the governing body itself or by the Legislature , unless the decision concerns a conditional use request or a request for a variance . Supervision of a program is an administrative decision. Hiring, disciplining, and setting the salaries of employees are administrative decisions. Section 2. That \u00a7 11-2-17.3 be amended to read as follows: 11-2-17.3. A county zoning ordinance adopted pursuant to this chapter that authorizes a conditional use of real property shall specify the approving authority, each category of conditional use requiring such approval, the zoning districts in which a conditional use is available, and the criteria for evaluating each conditional use. However, the board of county commissioners shall approve or disapprove any conditional use request concerning a concentrated animal feeding operation or variance request. The approving authority specified in the county zoning ordinance shall make a recommendation to the board of county commissioners on the conditional use request or variance request concerning a concentrated animal feeding operation. The board of county commissioners shall act on the recommendation within thirty days. The approving authority shall consider the stated criteria, the objectives of the comprehensive plan, and the purpose of the zoning ordinance and its relevant zoning districts when making a decision to approve or disapprove a conditional use request. The stated criteria shall include the degree of community support, public health issues, the quality of life of the community, and the protection of natural and economic resources. Section 3. That \u00a7 7-18A-1 be amended to read as follows: 7-18A-1.
