The levy may not be included in determining the tax levy limitation of the school district provided by law. Moneys collected from the tax shall be kept by the business manager in a special pension fund and may not be used for any other purpose except upon discontinuance of the pension system by the school district, in which case any unexpended balance shall be transferred to the general fund. For taxes payable in 2011, the total amount of revenue payable from the levy provided in this section may not increase more than the lesser of three percent or the index factor, as defined in \u00a7 10-13-38, over the maximum amount of revenue that could have been generated for the taxes payable in 2010.
