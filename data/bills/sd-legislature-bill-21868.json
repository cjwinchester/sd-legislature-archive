The transfer of wind energy tax revenue must be made within the ten- year timeframe identified in subdivision 13-13-10.1(6B) for each new wind farm. The maximum amount a school district may transfer on an annual basis is the amount of wind energy tax revenue that is able to be retained by the district and not counted as local effort.
