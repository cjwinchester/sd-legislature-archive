WHEREAS, on October 1, 1889, the citizens of the southern Dakota Territory adopted a constitution, elected their first state officials, and selected the city of Pierre as their temporary capital; and WHEREAS, on November 4, 1890, the citizens of the state of South Dakota selected the city of Pierre as their permanent capital in competition with the city of Huron. On November 8, 1904, the citizens of the state of South Dakota again selected the city of Pierre as their permanent capital after a spirited campaign with the city of Mitchell; and WHEREAS, the 1905 South Dakota Legislature authorized the construction of a permanent State Capitol. The building was constructed between 1905 and 1910. The plans for the building were designed by the Minneapolis architectural office of C.E. Bell and M.S. Detwiler. The building is based on a design similar to the Montana State Capitol in Helena, Montana. The planning process and construction costs were almost $1,000,000; and WHEREAS, on June 25, 1908, the granite cornerstone embossed with the Great Seal of South Dakota was ceremonially placed. State employees moved into the new State Capitol on May 1, 1910, and the building was officially dedicated on June 30, 1910; and WHEREAS, from the first floor, a marble staircase leads upstairs. On the second floor, the Grand Marble Staircase was constructed of white cloud marble shipped from the states of Tennessee and Vermont. The stained glass ceiling area above this staircase is referred to as the vault. The staircase opens onto a rotunda and the word, rotunda, means \"under the dome.\" The distance from the rotunda floor to the very top center black circle of the dome is ninety-six feet. It is another sixty-five feet to the top of the copper outer dome. A Greek-Roman architectural style was used in constructing the Capitol. This style of architecture contains much symbolism, which is reflected in each level of the dome. The bottom ring is designed to resemble a string of ribbons joined together, which is meant to symbolize the eternal nature of government. The interior of the dome is decorated with sixteen images of the Tree of Life. The dome also displays acanthus leaves to represent wisdom and a pasque flower, which is the state flower; and WHEREAS, in each corner under the dome are large murals of Greek goddesses which symbolize major interests in South Dakota. These murals were painted in 1910 by Edward Simons and still represent South Dakota as we know it today. Below each mural are Seals of Sovereignty. The purple-clothed goddess mural symbolizes livestock, and the seal under this mural represents France. The green-clothed goddess symbolizes industry and mining, and the seal under this mural represents Spain. Both Spain and France at one time owned the land now called South Dakota. The pink and white goddess mural symbolizes the love of family and state, and the seal under this mural is the State Seal of South Dakota. The golden-clothed goddess symbolizes agriculture, and the seal under this mural is the Seal of the United States; and WHEREAS, the third floor houses the state's House of Representatives and the state's Senate. The galleries for both, from which the public can observe the legislative process, are located on the fourth floor; and WHEREAS, the House chamber accommodates two members from each of thirty-five legislative districts. The ceiling of the House chamber features Victorian leaded stained glass. At the front of the chambers, ceiling level, is the largest painting in the Capitol. The painting is entitled, \"The Peace That Passes Understanding,\" by Charles Holloway. The rolltop desks in the House are constructed of oak wood, which in 1910 was less expensive than mahogany. The House chamber is larger in size than the Senate. Instead of marble columns, there are columns made of plaster which have been elaborately decorated; and WHEREAS, the Senate chamber accommodates one person from each of the thirty-five legislative districts and appears to be decorated a little more lavishly than the House of Representatives. At the time when the decorating budgets were made, both chambers were given the same dollar amount. Since there were twice as many legislators in the House as the Senate, the Representatives had to spend their budget prudently. The Senate chamber lower wall area around the third floor is marble and the rolltop desks are constructed of cherry wood which has been stained a dark mahogany. A canvas painting, at top ceiling level, is entitled, \"The Louisiana Purchase,\" by Charles Holloway. The ceiling of the Senate chamber is Victorian stained glass, cathedral in shape, which corresponds with the shape of the room; and WHEREAS, the columns in the Capitol are scagliola, which is a man-made marble. This style comes from Italy and it is considered a lost art. The components that make up the scagliola overlay are milk, ink, marble dust, and yarn. Under the scagliola layer is a cement pillar with a steel rod through the middle. In 1910 it cost approximately one hundred dollars to make a scagliola column, in comparison to one thousand dollars to make a marble column; and WHEREAS, the floor in the capitol building is made of terrazzo tile, which is said to have been laid by sixty-six Italian artists. To give these artists a chance to place their signatures in the building, each was given a blue stone to place in the floor. However, only fifty-five of the blue stones have been found, and, it is thought that the remaining stones may have been placed in locations now covered by walls, doors, or carpeting; and WHEREAS, the marble floor area inside the north entrance door is different from the Italian terrazzo tile used throughout the rest of the building. The reason for the dark marble floor here is that this portion of the building was added on to the main Capitol in 1932 and is referred to as the annex of the Capitol; and WHEREAS, in anticipation of South Dakota's state centennial in 1989, the building was extensively renovated and restored during the administrations of Governors Richard F. Kneip, Harvey L. Wollman, Bill Janklow, and George S. Mickelson. The renovation took twenty-two years and restored much of the building and its decoration, including the tile floor, to its original appearance. The tiled floor was repaired and each of the tile workers who did the repairs is said to have been given a heart-shaped stone with which to sign the new floor, as the original workers had done: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the Senate of the Eighty-fifth Legislature of the State of South Dakota, and the House of Representatives concurring therein, that the State Capitol has faithfully served the people of South Dakota for one hundred years and remains the center of South Dakota government; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the people of South Dakota commemorate the one hundredth anniversary of this great historic building with events on March 1 and June 19, 2010, in Pierre."}, {"bill_id": 2073, "bill_version_id": 13224, "bill_version": "Enrolled", "bill_version_date": "2010-03-02T12:00:39.303-06:00", "bill_text": ""}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 2073, "action_date": "2010-02-23T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 12874, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/12874.pdf", "status_text": "First Reading", "journal_page": 432, "committee_id_action": 84, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 2073, "action_date": "2010-02-24T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 12956, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/12956.pdf", "status_text": "Adopt Resolution", "journal_page": 457, "committee_id_action": 84, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 7099, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [758, 809, 785, 787, 790, 807, 805, 760, 778, 768, 782, 780, 739, 802, 764, 795, 741, 772, 761, 774, 766, 791, 806, 767, 808, 769, 743, 753, 745, 794, 799, 810, 747, 776], "Excused": [754]}}, {"bill_id": 2073, "action_date": "2010-02-25T12:30:00-06:00", "document_id": 13043, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/13043.pdf", "status_text": "First Reading", "journal_page": 615, "committee_id_action": 86, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 2073, "action_date": "2010-03-01T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 13126, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/13126.pdf", "status_text": "Concurred in Resolution", "journal_page": 629, "committee_id_action": 86, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 7224, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [821, 825, 771, 793, 781, 775, 844, 831, 820, 804, 779, 740, 813, 756, 748, 817, 814, 765, 811, 830, 798, 749, 829, 832, 826, 757, 835, 842, 777, 834, 803, 822, 843, 759, 816, 824, 788, 800, 801, 827, 750, 742, 770, 792, 783, 755, 751, 744, 840, 784, 839, 819, 836, 841, 818, 815, 833, 762, 746, 763, 752, 796, 828, 823, 789, 838, 837, 812, 786], "Excused": [773]}}]}
