If any other state or foreign country imposes any taxes, licenses, and other fees, in the aggregate, or fines, penalties, deposit requirements, or other material obligations, prohibitions, or restrictions upon South Dakota insurers, or upon the insurance producers or representatives of such insurers, which are, pursuant to the laws of that other state or country, in excess of those directly imposed upon similar insurers, or upon the insurance producers or representatives of such insurers, of that other state or country under the statutes of this state, then, so long as the laws of that other state or country continue in force or are so applied, the director of the Division of Insurance shall impose the same taxes, licenses, and other fees, in the aggregate, or fines, penalties, deposit requirements, or other material obligations, prohibitions, or restrictions of whatever kind upon the insurers, or upon the insurance producers or representatives of the insurers, of the other state or country doing business or seeking to do business in South Dakota. Any tax, license, or other fee or obligation imposed on South Dakota insurers or their insurance producers or representatives by any first or second class municipality, county, or other political subdivision or agency of the other state or country is considered to be imposed by such state or country within the meaning of this section. The time and period of payment of the retaliatory tax is the same, in all cases, as that of the gross premiums tax provided for in \u00a7 10-44-2. No interest charges or credits may be made or allowed for the use or loss of the use of funds due to any difference in the time or period of payment used in this state and the time or period used in a foreign state or country.
