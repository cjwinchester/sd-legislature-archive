If after delivering the noxious weed disclosure statement to the buyer or the buyer's agent and before the date of closing for the property or the date of possession of the property, whichever comes first, the seller becomes aware of any change of material fact that would affect the disclosure statement, the seller shall furnish a written amendment disclosing the change of material fact.
