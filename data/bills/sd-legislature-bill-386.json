That chapter 10-6 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Any agricultural land, as defined in \u00a7 10-6-31.3, for which the landowner has obtained a shooting preserve operating permit pursuant to chapter 41-10 is hereby classified for purposes of ad valorem taxation as recreational land. Section 2.

Any agricultural land classified pursuant to this section shall be valued for ad valorem tax purposes at the price for which such land sold multiplied times the level of assessment for nonagricultural property within the county. The assessed value of such land shall be increased or decreased each year by the same percentage that the value of nonagricultural property increases or decreases. Section 3.

Agricultural real estate also includes woodland, wasteland, and pasture land, but only if the land is held and operated in conjunction with agricultural real estate as defined and it is under the same ownership; (3) It consists of not less than twenty acres of unplatted land or is a part of a contiguous ownership of not less than eighty acres of unplatted land. The same acreage specifications apply to platted land, excluding land platted as a subdivision, which is in an unincorporated area. However, the board of county commissioners may increase the minimum acre requirement up to one hundred sixty acres. However, for tax purposes, land is not agricultural land if the land is classified pursuant to \u00a7 10-6-33.14 as a nonagricultural acreage as recreational land, agricultural investment property, class one noncropland, or class two noncropland .

If the district's levies are less than the maximum levies as stated in this section, the levies shall maintain the same proportion to each other as represented in the mathematical relationship at the maximum levies; and (4) The maximum tax levy on nonagricultural acreage property as defined in \u00a7 10-6- 33.14 recreational land as defined in section 1 of this Act , for such school district shall be three dollars and seventy-one cents per thousand dollars of taxable valuation.

These valuations shall be used for all school funding purposes. If the district has imposed an excess levy pursuant to \u00a7 10-12-43, the levies shall maintain the same proportion to each other as represented in the mathematical relationship at the maximum levies in this section. The school district may elect to tax at less than the maximum amounts set forth in this section. Section 8. That \u00a7 13-11-10 be amended to read as follows: 13-11-10. In implementing the terms of \u00a7 13-11-9, a separate weighted average tax levy of the receiving districts shall be calculated for agricultural property, nonagricultural acreage property, owner-occupied single-family dwelling property, and for nonagricultural property for each sending school district as follows: (1) The levy per thousand dollars of taxable valuation for agricultural property for each receiving school district shall be multiplied by the number of children from the sending school district to whom the receiving school district is providing educational services; (2) Add together the products from subdivision (1) for each receiving school district; (3) Divide the sum from subdivision (2) by the total number of students that the contracting school district is sending to the receiving school districts pursuant to \u00a7 13-15-1.3. The quotient is the weighted average tax levy per one thousand dollars of taxable valuation for agricultural property; (4) The weighted average tax levy per thousand dollars of taxable valuation for nonagricultural acreage, owner-occupied single-family dwellings , and nonagricultural property shall be obtained by repeating the procedure outlined in subdivisions (1) to (3), inclusive, for each class of property; and (5) The sum of the levies assessed for all funds in the sending district shall be equal to or greater than the sum of all levies for all funds in the receiving district. The above calculations do not include students receiving educational services from an out-of-state school district nor the tax levy of any out-of-state school district. Section 9. That \u00a7 \u00a7 10-6-33.14 to 10-6-33.18, inclusive, be repealed."}, {"bill_id": 386, "bill_version_id": 2727, "bill_version": "House Taxation Engrossed", "bill_version_date": "2008-02-07T11:08:31.75-06:00", "bill_text": "FOR AN ACT ENTITLED, An Act to provide for a legislative study of the classifications of real property.
