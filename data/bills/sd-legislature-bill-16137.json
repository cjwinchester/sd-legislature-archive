If the insured subsequently receives other benefits for a period for which the insurer paid benefits, the insurer may require reimbursement from the insured for any benefits already paid that otherwise would not have been paid. If the insured fails to make timely application for any other insurance coverage or governmental program for which that insured may be eligible, fails to actively and in good faith pursue all appeals procedures if benefits under other insurance or governmental program have been denied, or fails to produce satisfactory evidence that the applications have been made and the appeals pursued, benefits may be reduced or withheld.

However, in the case of a policy covering disability arising out of pregnancy, childbirth, or miscarriage, the maximum benefit period may be one month; (4) Include no reduction in benefits because of any cost of living increase in social security or similar benefits during a benefit period; (5) Require only one elimination period if a policy provides total disability benefits and partial disability benefits.
