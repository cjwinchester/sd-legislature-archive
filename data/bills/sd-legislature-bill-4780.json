BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 49-42A-1 be amended to read as follows: 49-42A-1. Terms used in this chapter mean: (1) \"Commission,\" the Public Utilities Commission of this state; (2) \"Public storage warehouse,\" a A public storage warehouse is a public warehouse where any personal property except grain, as defined in subdivision 49-45-1.1(2), is received for storage for hire and that generates more than five thousand dollars in gross income from storage for hire per calendar year. A public storage warehouse does not include self-storage units where the depositor's personal property is kept separate from the personal property of other depositors. Section 2. That chapter 49-42A be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Unless other insurance coverage is agreed to in writing by the depositor, a public storage warehouse shall keep all personal property of depositors fully insured against loss by fire, windstorm, and extended coverage risks. Failure to keep insurance in place is a Class 1 misdemeanor. Section 3. That \u00a7 49-42A-2 be repealed. 49-42A-2. The application for a license to operate as a public storage warehouse made pursuant to \u00a7 49-42-5.1 shall be in writing, in a form prescribed by the Public Utilities Commission, and shall set forth the location, name and capacity of such warehouse and the individual name of each person interested as owner or principal in the management of the warehouse. If the warehouse is owned or managed by a corporation, the name of the president, secretary and treasurer of such corporation shall be stated. The application shall also state that the applicant is seeking a public storage warehouse license. If a warehouseman has more than one public storage warehouse in the same municipality, only one license is required for all such public storage warehouses. Section 4. That \u00a7 49-42A-3 be repealed. 49-42A-3. The application for a license to operate as a public storage warehouse shall be accompanied by a fee of fifteen dollars. Section 5. That \u00a7 49-42A-4 be repealed. 49-42A-4. The bond required by \u00a7 49-42-5.1 for a public storage warehouseman is for the specific purpose of protecting persons storing property with such warehouseman. The amount of the bond shall be determined on the following basis: (1) Five thousand dollars bond for less than twenty thousand net square feet of floor space, or for less than fifty thousand net cubic feet of volume, devoted to the storage of goods; (2) Ten thousand dollars bond for twenty thousand or more, but less than fifty thousand net square feet of floor space, or for fifty thousand or more, but less than one hundred thousand net cubic feet of volume, devoted to the storage of goods; (3) Fifteen thousand dollars bond for fifty thousand or more, but less than one hundred thousand net square feet of floor space, or for one hundred thousand or more, but less than two hundred thousand net cubic feet of volume, devoted to the storage of goods, plus an additional five thousand dollars for each additional one hundred thousand net square feet of floor space or additional one hundred thousand net cubic feet of volume or fraction thereof. If the Public Utilities Commission finds, after due notice and hearing, that the bond filed by a warehouseman, the amount of which is based upon the above formula, is inadequate because of circumstances peculiar to that warehouse, the amount of that bond may be increased to such amount as the commission determines. If a warehouseman has more than one warehouse in the same first or second class municipality, only one bond is required. If the same warehouseman operates more than one warehouse in more than one municipality, a single bond may be filed covering warehouses at all locations and shall describe with particularity the exact locations of the warehouses to be covered. Section 6. That \u00a7 49-42A-5 be repealed. 49-42A-5. Any public storage warehouse license applicant may, in lieu of such bond, file with the Public Utilities Commission a certified copy of a legal liability insurance policy of like amount and coverages to be approved by the commission, which shall contain a loss payable endorsement to and for the benefit of depositors of any goods stored. Such policy may not be canceled during the period for which any license is issued except upon at least ninety days prior notice in writing to the commission. Section 7. That \u00a7 49-42A-6 be repealed. 49-42A-6. If, in the discretion of the Public Utilities Commission, the legal liability policy or the assets of a public storage warehouseman appear to be insufficient when compared to his storage obligations or to meet the bond requirements of the United States, or an agency or corporation controlled by the United States if they have a contract for storage with the public storage warehouseman, or for any other reason it appears necessary to the commission, the commission may require such additional bond or legal liability policy as is reasonable in the circumstances. Failure to keep such bond or insurance policy in force is a Class 2 misdemeanor. Section 8. That \u00a7 49-42A-7 be repealed. 49-42A-7. Authorized inspectors employed by the Public Utilities Commission may place a person under arrest without warrant for a violation of any provision of this chapter which is committed in the presence of such inspector. Commission inspectors having been given such limited arrest powers are not \"law enforcement officers\" for the purposes of \u00a7 23-3-27."}, {"bill_id": 4780, "bill_version_id": 3625,
