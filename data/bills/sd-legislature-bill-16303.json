BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 3-6-6 be amended to read as follows: 3-6-6. Each state employee shall earn fifteen working days vacation time per full year of employment. Any employee with more than fifteen years employment shall receive twenty working days vacation with pay for each year of employment. Such leave shall be accrued on an hourly, biweekly, or monthly basis as determined by the commissioner of personnel. Vacation hours earned shall not be used until the employee has served the initial six-month period, and are cumulative only to the extent of that which may be earned in a period of time not exceeding two years of regular and continuous state employment. Hours accumulated past this limitation may not be used for vacation, but shall be credited to the employee as service over and above time worked, for the purpose of determining a retirement allowance as provided in \u00a7 3-12-91. No advanced leave of absence for vacation with pay may be granted at any time. Section 2. That chapter 3-6 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: If a state employee who receives payment for four hundred eighty hours on retirement, voluntary resignation, or termination due to physical disability has at the time of payment unused leave of absence for sickness in excess of one thousand nine hundred twenty hours, any unused and uncompensated leave of absence for sickness in excess of one thousand nine hundred twenty hours shall be credited to the employee as service over and above time worked, for the purpose of determining a retirement allowance as provided in \u00a7 3-12-91.

No service may be credited pursuant to this subsection to any member who has withdrawn the member's accumulated contributions after July 1, 1967; and (h) Years of noncontributory service, or fractions thereof, earned by a member from July 1, 1967, to June 30, 1974, inclusive, but not credited under the South Dakota Public Employee Retirement System because of the age and service restrictions established under that system ; (i) Hours of unused and uncompensated leave of absence for sickness, as provided in section 2 of this Act, and (j) Hours of vacation leave beyond that which may be earned in a period of time not exceeding two years of regular and continuous state employment, as provided for by \u00a7 3-6-6 .
