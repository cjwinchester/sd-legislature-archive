BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 22-24B-2 be amended to read as follows: 22-24B-2. Any person who has been convicted for commission of a sex crime, as defined in \u00a7 22-24B-1, shall register as a sex offender. The term, convicted, includes a verdict or plea of guilty, a plea of nolo contendere, and a suspended imposition of sentence which has not been discharged pursuant to \u00a7 23A-27-14 prior to July 1, 1995. Any juvenile fifteen fourteen years or older shall register as a sex offender if that juvenile has been adjudicated of a sex crime rape as defined in \u00a7 22-22-7.2, 22-24B-1(1), or 22-24B-1(9), subdivisions 22-22-1(1) or 22-22-1(2) or of an out-of-state or federal offense that is comparable to the elements of these three sex crimes of rape or any crime committed in another state if the state also requires a juvenile adjudicated of that crime to register as a sex offender in that state. The term, adjudicated, includes a court's finding of delinquency, an admission, and a suspended adjudication of delinquency which has not been discharged pursuant to \u00a7 26-8C-4 prior to July 1, 2009. The sex offender shall register within five days of coming into any county to reside, temporarily domicile, attend school, attend postsecondary education classes, or work. Registration shall be with the chief of police of the municipality in which the sex offender resides, temporarily domiciles, attends school, attends postsecondary education classes, or works, or, if no chief of police exists, then with the sheriff of the county. If the sex offender is not otherwise registered in the state, the sex offender shall register within five days of coming into any county when the sex offender applies for or receives a South Dakota driver license, registers a motor vehicle, establishes a postal address, or registers to vote. A violation of this section is a Class 6 felony. Any person whose sentence is discharged under \u00a7 23A-27-14 after July 1, 1995, shall forward a certified copy of such formal discharge by certified mail to the Division of Criminal Investigation and to local law enforcement where the person is then registered under this section. Upon receipt of such notice, the person shall be removed from the sex offender registry open to public inspection and shall be relieved of further registration requirements under this section. Any juvenile whose suspended adjudication is discharged under \u00a7 26-8C-4 after July 1, 2009, shall forward a certified copy of the formal discharge by certified mail to the Division of Criminal Investigation and to local law enforcement where the juvenile is then registered under this section.
