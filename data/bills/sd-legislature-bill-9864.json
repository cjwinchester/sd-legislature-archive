WHEREAS, on December 22, 2018, the President of the United States and the United States Congress failed to agree on the timely appropriation of sufficient funds for the 2019 fiscal year or a temporary continuing resolution, resulting in a shutdown of federal government offices and services that continues to this day; and WHEREAS, the federal government shutdown has furloughed hundreds of thousands of employees, leaving them facing the uncertainty of lost wages, while thousands of essential government workers have been required to continue to work without compensation, and paychecks are on hold for approximately 800,000 federal employees; and WHEREAS, the closure of federal offices and loss of funding has caused hundreds of government-backed programs to completely cease operations; and WHEREAS, Congress has yet to approve funding for the Indian Health Service (IHS), which is dramatically impacted by the federal shutdown with some services and payments on hold, and many IHS employees are furloughed or working without pay, affecting the health services for Native Americans and hurting the economic security of the numerous Native American IHS employees; and WHEREAS, the shutdown has halted the issuance of small business loans and permits needed by local businesses to maintain and expand operations and has interfered with hiring by closing down employee verification systems, including the EVerify service to ensure persons are authorized to work in the United States; and WHEREAS, the Internal Revenue Service has been largely shuttered, leaving significant doubt as to whether tax refunds will be processed in a timely manner; and WHEREAS, Farm Service Agency (FSA) offices are closed and some deadlines have been extended, while farmers seek to sign up for deficiency payments for commodity price drops due to international trade issues; and WHEREAS, the government shutdown has halted mortgage approvals under programs designed to help individuals purchase homes with low down-payments and at low interest rates, including those offered to build or improve housing and essential community facilities in rural areas under the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA); and WHEREAS, there is growing concern that a prolonged shutdown may cause USDA programs, including SNAP and WIC, that provide nutritional assistance to low-income individuals and their children, to run out of funds and miss payments as soon as March 2019; and WHEREAS, the harm to South Dakota residents and businesses from the federal government shutdown is immediate and ongoing and will continue to be felt long after the shutdown ends: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the Senate of the Ninety-Fourth Legislature of the State of South Dakota, that the Senate expresses its concern for the welfare of South Dakota residents and businesses suffering from the ongoing federal government shutdown; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Senate strongly encourages South Dakota's United States Senators Rounds and Thune to support H.R. 264, due to overwhelming Senate support for the Further Additional Continuing Appropriations Act, 2019, contained in the amendment to H.R. 695 in the 115th Congress, that would have provided continuing Federal Fiscal Year 2019 appropriations to several federal agencies through February 8, 2019, but was not signed by the President; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Senate urges the President of the United States and the United States Congress to act quickly to pass legislation ending the federal government shutdown and to work this year to fix the legal immigration system in our country."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 9864, "action_date": "2019-01-23T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 52098, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/52098.pdf", "status_text": "First Reading", "journal_page": 153, "committee_id_action": 409, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 9864, "action_date": "2019-01-25T13:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 52455, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/52455.pdf", "status_text": "Referred to", "journal_page": 182, "committee_id_action": 409, "committee_id_assigned": 412, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 9864, "action_date": "2019-01-30T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 52507, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/52507.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 412, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 9864, "action_date": "2019-01-30T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 52850, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/52850.pdf", "status_text": "Tabled", "journal_page": 223, "committee_id_action": 412, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 27619, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [1441, 1588, 1604, 1601, 1603, 1597, 1585, 1606], "Excused": [1595]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/9864"}
