BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 58-17-30.3 be amended to read as follows: 58-17-30.3. The coverage for a newly born child from the moment of birth or for a newly adopted child, from the beginning of the six-month adoption bonding period, shall consist of coverage of injury or sickness including the necessary care and treatment of premature birth and medically diagnosed congenital defects and birth abnormalities. The coverage required by this section applies to any subsequent health benefit plan that is purchased providing coverage for that newly born or newly adopted child if application for the subsequent coverage is made within sixty-three days of the termination of the prior coverage and if the coverage is issued pursuant to \u00a7 58-17-85. The provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 58-17-30.2 to 58-17-30.4, inclusive, apply to any individually written health benefit plan issued or renewed by any health insurer, health carrier, health maintenance organization, fraternal benefit society, nonprofit medical and surgical plan, nonprofit hospital service plan, or other entity providing coverage through a health benefit plan subject to the provisions of this title. Section 2. That \u00a7 58-17-85 be repealed. 58-17-85. If a person has an aggregate of at least twelve months of creditable coverage, is a resident of this state, and applies within sixty-three days of the date of losing prior creditable coverage, the person is eligible for coverage as provided for in \u00a7\u00a7 58-17-68, 58-17-70, 58-17-85, and 58-17-113 to 58-17-142, inclusive, if none of the following apply: (1) The applicant is eligible for continuation of coverage under an employer plan; (2) The person is eligible for an employer group plan, Part A or Part B of medicare, or medicaid; (3) The person has other health insurance coverage; (4) The person's most recent coverage was terminated because of the person's nonpayment of premium or fraud; (5) The person loses coverage under a short term or limited duration plan; or (6) The person's last coverage was creditable coverage as defined in subdivision 58-17-69(13) or a federal preexisting condition insurance plan. Any person who has exhausted continuation rights and who is eligible for conversion or other individual or association coverage has the option of obtaining coverage pursuant to this section or the conversion plan or other coverage. If a person chooses conversion coverage, other than pursuant to \u00a7 58-17-74, in lieu of coverage pursuant to this section and the person later exhausts the lifetime maximum of the conversion coverage, the person may obtain coverage pursuant to this section as long as the person continues to satisfy the criteria of this section. A person who is otherwise eligible for the issuance of coverage pursuant to this section may not be required to show proof that coverage was denied by another carrier. For purposes of this section, reasonable evidence that the prospective enrollee is a resident of this state shall be required. Factors that may be considered include a driver's license, voter registration, and where the prospective enrollee resides. Any person who was eligible for the risk pool and opted for coverage pursuant to \u00a7 58-17-74 may, at any time while covered under that policy or within sixty-three days of terminating that coverage, elect to enroll in the risk pool. Section 3. That \u00a7 58-17-85.1 be repealed. 58-17-85.1. Any health carrier with any in force individual health benefit plan issued in accordance with \u00a7 58-17-85 prior to August 1, 2003, shall offer, at the option of the insured, additional deductible options of the following: (1) One thousand dollars with a four thousand dollar out-of-pocket coinsurance maximum; (2) Three thousand dollars with a two thousand dollar out-of-pocket coinsurance maximum; (3) Five thousand dollars with no more than a twenty-five percent coinsurance; and (4) Ten thousand dollars with a twelve thousand two hundred fifty dollar out-of-pocket maximum, including the deductible. Any additional deductible option, with the exception of the five thousand dollar option, may not require that the insured be responsible for more than a fifty percent coinsurance. If the policy is a family policy, the health carrier may satisfy the options listed above by offering amounts that are twice the amounts provided in subdivisions (1) to (4), inclusive. The premium rates for these benefit plans shall be adjusted based upon the actuarial difference in benefits. A health carrier is not required to offer a deductible option if that option would decrease the insured's deductible or out-of-pocket maximum. The director may approve alternatives to those deductible options specified in this section if the alternatives are consistent with the offering of increased deductible options to insureds and at least one of the alternatives is consistent with the formation of a health savings account as provided for by 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 223. Section 4. That \u00a7 58-17-114 be amended to read as follows: 58-17-114.

The term, carrier, includes any health benefit plan issued through an association or trust. The term, carrier, does not include excess or stop loss covering a risk of insurance as defined in \u00a7\u00a7 58-9-5 to 58-9-33, inclusive, and does not include health insurance for coverages that are not health benefit plans issued by insurance companies, prepaid hospital or medical service plans, or health maintenance organizations; (2) \"Director,\" the director of the Division of Insurance; (3) \"Enrollee,\" any individual who is provided qualified comprehensive health coverage under the risk pool; (4) \"Health benefit plan,\" as defined in subdivision 58-17-66(9); (5) \"Health care facility,\" any health care facility licensed pursuant to chapter 34-12; (6) \"Health insurance,\" as defined in \u00a7 58-9-3; (7) \"Medicaid,\" the federal-state assistance program established under Title XIX of the Social Security Act; (8) \"Medicare,\" the federal government health insurance program established under Title XVIII of the Social Security Act; (9) \"Policy,\" any contract, policy, or plan of health insurance; (10) \"Policy year,\" any consecutive twelve-month period during which a policy provides or obligates the carrier to provide health insurance. Section 5. That \u00a7 58-17-115 be repealed. 58-17-115. There is established a risk pool to provide health insurance coverage, pursuant to the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 58-17-68, 58-17-70, 58-17-85, and 58-17-113 to 58-17-142, inclusive, to each eligible South Dakota resident who applies for coverage after July 31, 2003. Section 6. That \u00a7 58-17-117 be repealed. 58-17-117. The board shall request bids for an administrator of the risk pool. Such contract with an administrator shall be designed to become effective no later than July 1, 2005. If the board determines that the bids are not consistent with the efficient operation of the risk pool, the board may continue to administer the risk pool and to contract for services. Regardless, the board shall perform all appropriate oversight functions. Section 7. That \u00a7 58-17-118 be repealed. 58-17-118. There is established an advisory panel to the board consisting of two lay members, one of which shall be an employee, and at least one representative of each of the following: individual health insurance carriers, group health insurance carriers, health care providers, insurance producers, health care facilities, self-insurers, and employers as well as one state senator appointed by the president pro tempore of the Senate and one state representative appointed by the speaker of the House of Representatives. The Governor shall appoint the nonlegislative representatives of the advisory panel for a specific term not less than two years and not more than three years. The terms of service shall overlap. The advisory panel may make recommendations to the board regarding benefits and exclusions in the risk pool coverage, eligibility for the risk pool, assessments of carriers, and operation of the risk pool. The board shall consider any input from the advisory panel in making any decisions relative to rule-making, benefits, exclusions, eligibility, assessments, and risk pool operation, and shall sponsor and attend such meetings as may be necessary between the board and the advisory panel to provide the input as required by this section. Section 8. That \u00a7 58-17-121 be amended to read as follows: 58-17-121. The board has the general powers and authority enumerated by \u00a7\u00a7 58-17-68, 58-17-70, 58-17-85, and 58-17-113 to 58-17-142, inclusive, and, in addition to the responsibilities in \u00a7 58-17-119, may: (1) Enter into any contract as necessary or proper to carry out \u00a7\u00a7 58-17-68, 58-17-70, 58-17-85, and 58-17-113 to 58-17-142, inclusive; (2) Take any legal action necessary or proper for recovery of any assessments for, on behalf of, or against participating carriers; (3) Take any legal action necessary to avoid the payment of improper claims against the risk pool or the coverage provided by or through the risk pool; (4) Use medical review to determine that care is clinically appropriate and cost effective for the risk pool; (5) Establish appropriate rates, scales of rates, rate classifications, and rating adjustments, none of which may be unreasonable in relation to the coverage provided and the reasonable operational expenses of the risk pool; (6) Issue risk pool plans on an indemnity, network, or provision of service basis and may design, utilize, contract, or otherwise arrange for the delivery of cost effective health care services, including establishing or contracting with preferred provider organizations, health maintenance organizations, and other limited network provider arrangements in providing the coverage required by \u00a7\u00a7 58-17-68, 58-17-70, 58-17-85, and 58-17-113 to 58-17-142, inclusive; (7) Create appropriate legal, actuarial, and other committees necessary to provide technical assistance in the operation of the risk pool, plan and other contract design, and any other functions within the authority of the risk pool; and (8) Provide, by including a provision in its plans, for subrogation rights by the risk pool for situations in which the risk pool pays expenses on behalf of an individual who is injured or suffers a disease under circumstances creating a liability upon another person to pay damages to the extent of the expenses paid by the risk pool, but only to the extent the damages exceed the plan deductible and coinsurance amounts paid by the enrollee; and (9) Allow an applicant who is not otherwise eligible for coverage pursuant to \u00a7 58-17-85 to enroll in the risk pool if all of the following are met: (a) The applicant is covered by an individual health benefit plan that is no longer being marketed in this state and has a premium rate that exceeds two hundred percent of the applicable rate, based upon that person's rating characteristics, charged to risk pool enrollees; (b) The risk pool's financial solvency would not be impaired by enrolling the applicants under this subdivision; (c) Sufficient federal funding exists to cover expected losses for those enrolled pursuant to this subdivision; and (d) The number of applicants enrolled into the risk pool pursuant to this subdivision in any given calendar year does not exceed three percent of the total number of covered persons in individual health benefit plans that are no longer being marketed in this state. Nothing in \u00a7\u00a7 58-17-68, 58-17-70, 58-17-85, and 58-17-113 to 58-17-142, inclusive, constitutes a waiver of immunity. Section 9. That \u00a7 58-17-123 be amended to read as follows: 58-17-123. An enrollee shall notify any health care provider or any provider of pharmacy goods or services prior to receiving goods or services or as soon as reasonably possible that the enrollee is qualified to receive comprehensive coverage under the risk pool. Any health care provider or provider of pharmacy goods or services who provides goods or services to an enrollee and requests payment is deemed to have agreed to the reimbursement system as provided for in \u00a7\u00a7 58-17-68, 58-17-70, 58-17-85, and 58-17-113 to 58-17-142, inclusive. Each health care provider shall be reimbursed using medicare reimbursement methodologies at a rate that is designed to achieve a payment that is equivalent to one hundred thirty-five percent of South Dakota's medicaid reimbursement for the goods or services delivered. Each provider of pharmacy goods or services shall be reimbursed at one hundred fifteen percent of South Dakota's medicaid reimbursement for any goods or services provided. Any reimbursement rate to a provider is limited to the lesser of billed charges or the rates as provided by this section. In no event may a provider collect or attempt to collect from an enrollee any money owed to the provider by the risk pool nor may the provider have any recourse against an enrollee for any covered charges in excess of the copayment, coinsurance, or deductible amounts specified in the coverage. However, the provider may bill the enrollee for noncovered services. Section 10. That \u00a7 58-17-125 be repealed. 58-17-125. The premium rates for coverages provided by the risk pool may not be unreasonable in relation to the benefits provided, the risk experience, and the reasonable expenses of providing coverage. Case characteristics as allowed pursuant to \u00a7 58-17-74 may be used in establishing rates for those covered by the risk pool. The rates shall take into consideration the extra morbidity and administrative expenses, if any, for enrollees in the risk pool. The rates for a given classification for those that qualify for coverage pursuant to \u00a7 58-17-85 shall be one hundred fifty percent of the average actively marketed premium or payment rate for that classification charged by the carriers with the largest number of individual health benefit plans in the state during the preceding calendar year. For purposes of this section, only individual health benefit plans that are being actively marketed to the general public may be utilized in determining the largest carriers. The board shall select a sufficient number of carriers from which to calculate the average so that at least ninety percent of the market is represented and the carriers selected sequentially have the largest number of actively marketed health benefit plans. The number of carriers selected may not be less than three. In determining the average rate of the largest individual health carriers, the rates or payments charged by the carriers shall be actuarially adjusted to determine the rate or payment that would have been charged for benefits similar to those provided by the risk pool. Section 11. That \u00a7 58-17-126 be amended to read as follows: 58-17-126. Following the close of each fiscal year, the board shall determine the net premiums and payments, the expenses of administration, and the incurred losses of the risk pool for the year. In sharing losses among the carriers, the board may abate or defer in any part the assessment of a carrier, if, in the opinion of the board, payment of the assessment would endanger the ability of the carrier to fulfill its contractual obligations. The board may also provide for an initial or interim assessment against carriers if necessary to assure the financial capability of the risk pool to meet the incurred or estimated claims expenses or operating expenses of the risk pool. This assessment may not exceed twenty-five cents per covered life per month from the time period the risk pool becomes effective. Any assessment made after June 30, 2009, may not be in excess of thirty-five cents per covered life per month. Net gains shall be held at interest to offset future losses or allocated to reduce future assessments. The assessment of each carrier shall be based upon the number of persons each carrier covers through primary, excess, and stop loss insurance in this state and shall be as follows: (1) In addition to the powers enumerated in \u00a7\u00a7 58-17-68, 58-17-70, 58-17-85, and 58-17-113 to 58-17-142, inclusive, the board may assess carriers in accordance with the provisions of this section, and make advance interim assessments as may be reasonable and necessary for the risk pool's organizational and interim operating expenses; (2) Following the close of each fiscal year, the board shall determine the expenses of administration, the net premiums (premiums less reasonable administrative expense allowances), and the incurred losses for the year, taking into account investment income and other appropriate gains and losses. The deficit incurred by the risk pool shall be recouped by assessments apportioned under this section by the board among carriers and from other sources as may be allowed under law; (3) Each carrier's assessment shall be determined by multiplying the total assessment of all carriers as determined in subdivision (2) by a fraction, the numerator of which equals the number of individuals in this state covered under health benefit plans and certificates, including by way of excess or stop loss coverage, by that carrier, and the denominator of which equals the total number of all individuals in this state covered under health insurance policies and certificates, including by way of excess or stop loss coverage, by all carriers, all determined as of the end of the prior calendar year; (4) The board shall make reasonable efforts designed to ensure that each insured individual is counted only once with respect to any assessment. For that purpose, the board shall require each carrier that obtains excess or stop loss insurance to include in its count of insured individuals all individuals whose coverage is reinsured, including by way of excess or stop loss coverage, in whole or part. The board shall allow a carrier who is an excess or stop loss carrier to exclude from its number of insured individuals those who have been counted by the primary carrier, the primary reinsurer, or the primary excess or stop loss carrier for the purpose of determining its assessment under this section; (5) Each carrier shall file with the board annual statements and other reports deemed to be necessary by the board. The board shall determine each carrier's assessment based on these annual statements and reports. The board may use any reasonable method of estimating the number of insureds of a carrier if the specific number is unknown. With respect to carriers that are excess or stop loss carriers, the board may use any reasonable method of estimating the number of persons insured by each reinsurer or excess or stop loss carrier; (6) Each carrier may petition the board for an abatement or deferment of all or part of an assessment imposed by the board. The board may abate or defer, in whole or in part, the assessment if, in the opinion of the board, payment of the assessment would endanger the ability of the carrier to fulfill the carrier's contractual obligations. If an assessment against a carrier is abated or deferred in whole or in part, the amount by which the assessment is abated or deferred may be assessed against the other carriers in a manner consistent with the basis for assessments set forth in this section. The carrier receiving the deferment is liable to the risk pool and remains liable for the deficiency. Any assessment of the carrier is due and payable on any covered person who is a resident in this state regardless of the state of issuance of the policy or master policy. Section 12. That \u00a7 58-17-127 be repealed. 58-17-127. The board may conduct periodic audits to assure the general accuracy of the financial data submitted to it and may require the plan administrator or any contractor to provide the board with an annual audit of its operations to be made by an independent certified public accountant. Section 13. That \u00a7 58-17-128 be repealed. 58-17-128. Any plan provided pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 58-17-68, 58-17-70, 58-17-85, and 58-17-113 to 58-17-142, inclusive, shall be filed with and approved by the director before its use. Section 14. That \u00a7 58-17-129 be repealed. 58-17-129. No fee or tax levied by this state or any of its political subdivisions applies to the risk pool or any function of the risk pool performed in pursuance of \u00a7\u00a7 58-17-68, 58-17-70, 58-17-85, and 58-17-113 to 58-17-142, inclusive. Section 15. That \u00a7 58-17-130 be repealed. 58-17-130. The risk pool shall offer at least three plan designs that provide comprehensive coverage benefits consistent with major medical coverage currently being offered in the individual health insurance market. The coverage and benefits for plans provided pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 58-17-68, 58-17-70, 58-17-85, and 58-17-113 to 58-17-142, inclusive, may be established by the board, consistent with the requirements of \u00a7\u00a7 58-17-68, 58-17-70, 58-17-85, and 58-17-113 to 58-17-142, inclusive, and may not be altered by any other state law without specific reference to \u00a7\u00a7 58-17-68, 58-17-70, 58-17-85, and 58-17-113 to 58-17-142, inclusive, indicating a legislative intent to add or delete from the coverage provided pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 58-17-68, 58-17-70, 58-17-85, and 58-17-113 to 58-17-142, inclusive. All plans shall cover biologically-based mental illnesses on the same basis as other covered illnesses. The board may create plan designs to meet federal requirements for qualifying high deductible health plans for health savings accounts. Section 16. That \u00a7 58-17-131 be repealed. 58-17-131. Each plan shall include disease management programs that contain cost containment mechanisms. If the enrollee does not enroll and participate in the applicable cost containment activities, the enrollee is responsible for fifty percent of the eligible expenses for related services after the deductible is met, and there is no maximum out-of-pocket coinsurance amount. Section 17. That \u00a7 58-17-132 be repealed. 58-17-132. Each plan shall provide pharmacy benefits. The cost sharing provisions for the pharmacy benefit shall be established by the board and outlined in the plan document. Section 18. That \u00a7 58-17-133 be repealed. 58-17-133. Each plan shall offer the following plan-year benefit maximums: (1) Thirty days coverage for inpatient alcoholism and substance abuse treatment; (2) Two thousand dollars for outpatient alcoholism and substance abuse treatment; and (3) Nine hundred dollars for up to thirty outpatient mental health visits for qualified conditions that are not biologically-based.

That \u00a7 58-17-123 be amended to read as follows: 58-17-123. An enrollee shall notify any health care provider or any provider of pharmacy goods or services prior to receiving goods or services or as soon as reasonably possible that the enrollee is qualified to receive comprehensive coverage under the risk pool. Any health care provider or provider of pharmacy goods or services who provides goods or services to an enrollee and requests payment is deemed to have agreed to the reimbursement system as provided for in \u00a7\u00a7 58-17-68, 58-17-70, 58-17-85, and 58-17-113 to 58-17-142, inclusive.

Each provider of pharmacy goods or services shall be reimbursed at one hundred fifteen percent of South Dakota's medicaid reimbursement for any goods or services provided. Any reimbursement rate to a provider is limited to the lesser of billed charges or the rates as provided by this section. In no event may a provider collect or attempt to collect from an enrollee any money owed to the provider by the risk pool nor may the provider have any recourse against an enrollee for any covered charges in excess of the copayment, coinsurance, or deductible amounts specified in the coverage. However, the provider may bill the enrollee for noncovered services. Section 10. That \u00a7 58-17-125 be repealed. 58-17-125. The premium rates for coverages provided by the risk pool may not be unreasonable in relation to the benefits provided, the risk experience, and the reasonable expenses of providing coverage. Case characteristics as allowed pursuant to \u00a7 58-17-74 may be used in establishing rates for those covered by the risk pool. The rates shall take into consideration the extra morbidity and administrative expenses, if any, for enrollees in the risk pool. The rates for a given classification for those that qualify for coverage pursuant to \u00a7 58-17-85 shall be one hundred fifty percent of the average actively marketed premium or payment rate for that classification charged by the carriers with the largest number of individual health benefit plans in the state during the preceding calendar year. For purposes of this section, only individual health benefit plans that are being actively marketed to the general public may be utilized in determining the largest carriers. The board shall select a sufficient number of carriers from which to calculate the average so that at least ninety percent of the market is represented and the carriers selected sequentially have the largest number of actively marketed health benefit plans. The number of carriers selected may not be less than three. In determining the average rate of the largest individual health carriers, the rates or payments charged by the carriers shall be actuarially adjusted to determine the rate or payment that would have been charged for benefits similar to those provided by the risk pool. Section 11. That \u00a7 58-17-126 be amended to read as follows: 58-17-126. Following the close of each fiscal year, the board shall determine the net premiums and payments, the expenses of administration, and the incurred losses of the risk pool for the year. In sharing losses among the carriers, the board may abate or defer in any part the assessment of a carrier, if, in the opinion of the board, payment of the assessment would endanger the ability of the carrier to fulfill its contractual obligations. The board may also provide for an initial or interim assessment against carriers if necessary to assure the financial capability of the risk pool to meet the incurred or estimated claims expenses or operating expenses of the risk pool. This assessment may not exceed twenty-five cents per covered life per month from the time period the risk pool becomes effective. Any assessment made after June 30, 2009, may not be in excess of thirty-five cents per covered life per month. Net gains shall be held at interest to offset future losses or allocated to reduce future assessments. The assessment of each carrier shall be based upon the number of persons each carrier covers through primary, excess, and stop loss insurance in this state and shall be as follows: (1) In addition to the powers enumerated in \u00a7\u00a7 58-17-68, 58-17-70, 58-17-85, and 58-17-113 to 58-17-142, inclusive, the board may assess carriers in accordance with the provisions of this section, and make advance interim assessments as may be reasonable and necessary for the risk pool's organizational and interim operating expenses; (2) Following the close of each fiscal year, the board shall determine the expenses of administration, the net premiums (premiums less reasonable administrative expense allowances), and the incurred losses for the year, taking into account investment income and other appropriate gains and losses. The deficit incurred by the risk pool shall be recouped by assessments apportioned under this section by the board among carriers and from other sources as may be allowed under law; (3) Each carrier's assessment shall be determined by multiplying the total assessment of all carriers as determined in subdivision (2) by a fraction, the numerator of which equals the number of individuals in this state covered under health benefit plans and certificates, including by way of excess or stop loss coverage, by that carrier, and the denominator of which equals the total number of all individuals in this state covered under health insurance policies and certificates, including by way of excess or stop loss coverage, by all carriers, all determined as of the end of the prior calendar year; (4) The board shall make reasonable efforts designed to ensure that each insured individual is counted only once with respect to any assessment. For that purpose, the board shall require each carrier that obtains excess or stop loss insurance to include in its count of insured individuals all individuals whose coverage is reinsured, including by way of excess or stop loss coverage, in whole or part. The board shall allow a carrier who is an excess or stop loss carrier to exclude from its number of insured individuals those who have been counted by the primary carrier, the primary reinsurer, or the primary excess or stop loss carrier for the purpose of determining its assessment under this section; (5) Each carrier shall file with the board annual statements and other reports deemed to be necessary by the board. The board shall determine each carrier's assessment based on these annual statements and reports. The board may use any reasonable method of estimating the number of insureds of a carrier if the specific number is unknown. With respect to carriers that are excess or stop loss carriers, the board may use any reasonable method of estimating the number of persons insured by each reinsurer or excess or stop loss carrier; (6) Each carrier may petition the board for an abatement or deferment of all or part of an assessment imposed by the board. The board may abate or defer, in whole or in part, the assessment if, in the opinion of the board, payment of the assessment would endanger the ability of the carrier to fulfill the carrier's contractual obligations. If an assessment against a carrier is abated or deferred in whole or in part, the amount by which the assessment is abated or deferred may be assessed against the other carriers in a manner consistent with the basis for assessments set forth in this section. The carrier receiving the deferment is liable to the risk pool and remains liable for the deficiency. Any assessment of the carrier is due and payable on any covered person who is a resident in this state regardless of the state of issuance of the policy or master policy. Section 12.
