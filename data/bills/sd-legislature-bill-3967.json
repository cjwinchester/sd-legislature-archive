That \u00a7 36-34-13.1 be amended to read as follows: 36-34-13.1. No person may represent himself or herself oneself as a licensed or certified chemical dependency counselor (CCDC) or addiction counselor, addiction counselor trainee, certified prevention specialist, prevention specialist trainee, or any other title that includes such words unless the person is certified by the South Dakota Certification Board for Alcohol and Drug Professionals or licensed under this chapter. Section 12. That \u00a7 36-34-14 be repealed. 36-34-14. A chemical dependency counselor trainee may perform chemical dependency counseling services so long as the trainee is working under the supervision of a certified chemical dependency counselor.

The failure of a practitioner to renew the certificate or license by the last day of the practitioner's birth month each year constitutes a forfeiture of status. However, any person who has forfeited one's status may have it restored by requesting reinstatement and paying the reinstatement fee and the renewal fee within fifteen days of the forfeiture. Any person who fails to have the status restored within fifteen days shall take the examination as prescribed for an applicant to become certified or licensed and comply with all the provisions applicable to any applicant for certification or licensure. Section 15.

Section 17. That \u00a7 36-34-16 be amended to read as follows: 36-34-16. The board may use its own staff or employ certified chemical dependency or licensed addiction counselors, certified prevention specialists, agents, or investigators to assist in the enforcement of this chapter or any rule promulgated by the board. Any person violating the provisions of this chapter may be enjoined from further violations by an action brought by the state's attorney of the county where the violations occurred or by an action brought by any citizen in the state. The attorney general, the board, or the state's attorney may apply to the circuit court for the county in which a violation of this chapter is alleged to have occurred for an order enjoining or restraining the commission or continuance of the acts. The board may authorize a hearing examiner to conduct the hearing required to determine a violation of this chapter. Section 18. That \u00a7 36-34-18 be amended to read as follows: 36-34-18. The board shall receive complaints from its members, consumers, third party carriers providing financial reimbursement for chemical dependency prevention or counseling services, or the public concerning a practitioner's professional practices. Each complaint received shall be logged by the secretary-treasurer, or the board's designee, recording the practitioner's name, name of the complaining party, date of the complaint, a brief statement of the complaint, and its ultimate disposition. The board shall investigate each alleged violation of this chapter. All disciplinary proceedings held under the authority of this chapter shall be conducted in accordance with chapter 1-26. Section 19. That \u00a7 36-34-19 be amended to read as follows: 36-34-19. The decision of the board to cancel, suspend, or revoke a certification or licensure or to reissue a cancelled, suspended, or revoked certification or licensure requires a majority vote of all the board members. Section 20. That \u00a7 36-34-20 be amended to read as follows: 36-34-20. If the board determines that any complaint is frivolous or clearly unfounded in fact, the board may dismiss the complaint and, by a separate and unanimous vote of the board, may expunge the complaint from the record of the certified practitioner. Section 21. That \u00a7 36-34-21 be amended to read as follows: 36-34-21. Any practitioner subject to this chapter shall practice in accordance with the standards established by the board and is subject to the exercise of the disciplinary sanctions enumerated in \u00a7 36-34-23 if, after a hearing in the manner provided in chapter 1-26, the board finds that: (1) A practitioner has employed or knowingly cooperated in fraud or material deception in order to obtain a certification certificate or license to practice the profession, or has engaged in fraud or material deception in the course of professional services or activities; (2) A practitioner has been convicted in any court of a felony; (3) A practitioner has engaged in or permitted the performance of unacceptable patient care by the practitioner or by auxiliaries working under the practitioner's supervision due to any deliberate or negligent act or failure to act; (4) A practitioner has knowingly violated any provision of this chapter or board rules; (5) A practitioner has continued to practice although the practitioner has become unfit to practice due to professional incompetence, failure to keep abreast of current professional theory or practice, physical or mental disability, or addiction or severe dependency upon or use of alcohol or other drugs which endanger the public by impairing a practitioner's ability to practice safely; (6) A practitioner has engaged in lewd or immoral conduct in connection with the delivery of chemical dependency addiction counseling or prevention services to consumers; (7) A practitioner has or is employing or assisting an uncertified or unlicensed person to hold himself or herself out as a certified chemical dependency or licensed addiction counselor or certified prevention specialist; or (8) A practitioner has engaged in submitted false or, misleading advertising, or inaccurate information to the board in obtaining issuance or renewal of recognition, certification, or licensure; or (9) A practitioner has failed to provide information or documents requested by the board in the investigation or prosecution of a professional or ethical complaint filed with the board. No suspension or revocation may be based on a judgment as to therapeutic value of any individual treatment rendered, but only upon a repeated pattern or trend of treatment resulting in unacceptable results. Each legally required notice shall be sent via ordinary first-class mail to the most recent address that the practitioner has reported to the board. The practitioner has the duty to maintain an accurate and current mailing address with the board. Section 22. That \u00a7 36-34-23 be amended to read as follows: 36-34-23. The board may impose any of the following sanctions, singly or in combination, if the board finds that a practitioner has violated any part of \u00a7 36-34-21: (1) Revoke a practitioner's certification or license to practice for an indefinite length of time; (2) Suspend a practitioner's certification or license for a specific or indefinite length of time; (3) Censure a practitioner; (4) Issue a letter of reprimand; (5) Place a practitioner on probationary status and require the practitioner to report regularly to the board on the matters which are the basis for probation; (6) Limit the practitioner's practice to areas prescribed by the board and continue to renew professional education until a satisfactory degree of skill has been attained in those areas which are the basis of the probation; (7) Require the practitioner to reimburse the board in an amount equal to the costs incurred for the investigation and disciplinary hearing including the amount paid by the board for legal expenses, attorney fees, court reporters, and any mediator or hearing officer, provided there is clear and convincing evidence of wrongdoing on the part of the practitioner. The board may withdraw the probation if the board finds the deficiencies that resulted in disciplinary action have been remedied. Certification or licensure shall remain in effect during the pendency of an appeal unless suspended under \u00a7 36-34-24. Section 23. That \u00a7 36-34-24 be amended to read as follows: 36-34-24. The board may summarily suspend a practitioner's recognition, certification, or licensure in advance of a final adjudication or during the appeals process if the board finds that a practitioner would represent a clear and immediate danger to the public health and safety if the practitioner were allowed to continue to practice. A practitioner whose recognition, certification, or licensure is suspended under this section is entitled to a hearing before the board within twenty days after the effective date of the suspension. The practitioner may subsequently appeal the suspension to circuit court in accordance with chapter 1-26. Section 24. That \u00a7 36-34-25 be amended to read as follows: 36-34-25. Any practitioner whose recognition, certification, or registration license to practice has been suspended or revoked may be reinstated or a new recognition, certification, or registration license may be issued, as the case may be, if in the discretion of the board, such action is warranted. The board may require the applicant to pay all costs of the proceedings resulting in the applicant's suspension or revocation of certification or registration and reinstatement or new certification or registration. In addition, the board may, by rule promulgated pursuant to chapter 1-26, require a fee for reinstatement, not to exceed one hundred fifty dollars including the amount paid by the board for legal expenses and attorney fees. Section 25. That \u00a7 36-34-26 be amended to read as follows: 36-34-26. In the prosecution of any person for violation of this chapter, it is not necessary to allege or prove lack of valid recognition, certification, or licensure. Proof of recognition, certification, or registration licensure is a matter of defense to be established by the defendant. Section 26. That \u00a7 36-34-27 be amended to read as follows: 36-34-27. Nothing in this chapter may be construed to limit the ongoing recognition, certification, or licensure of any person at the level of recognition, certification, or licensure and for the time period established under the former South Dakota Chemical Dependency Counselor Certification Board doing business as or the Certification Board for Alcohol and Drug Professionals."}, {"bill_id": 3967,
