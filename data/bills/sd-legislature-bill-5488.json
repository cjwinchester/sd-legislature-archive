No exempt motor carrier may perform interstate operations, to, from, within, or traversing this state unless it files an application for the registration of such operation with the department and the department approves the application by the issuance of a registration permit. In lieu of a registration permit, all regulated motor carriers shall comply with 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 13901 and 49 CFR PART 365 as of January 1, 2005, before performing any interstate operations to, from, within, or traversing this state. Section 2. That \u00a7 49-28-36.1 be repealed. 49-28-36.1. The fee to accompany the filing of an application for registration as an exempt motor carrier is twenty-five dollars. However, no registration fee is required if the applicant has previously paid a registration fee for other interstate operations and is registered with the department at the time the application is received by the department. Section 3. That \u00a7 49-28-36.2 be repealed. 49-28-36.2. An interstate motor carrier registered pursuant to \u00a7 49-28-36 is subject to regulation and control of the department only to the extent permitted by the Constitution of the United States and acts of Congress relating to interstate commerce.

Any nonresident exempt motor carrier shall, before a registration permit is issued under this chapter, designate and maintain in this state an agent upon whom may be served all summonses or other lawful processes in any action or proceeding against such motor carrier arising from its carrier operations. Service of process upon or acceptance or acknowledgment of the service by the agent has the same legal force and validity as if duly served upon the nonresident carrier personally. The designation of agent shall be in writing, shall give the name and address of the agent, and shall be filed in the office of the department. Any nonresident regulated motor carrier shall file with its registration state the name of an agent to receive service of process from South Dakota pursuant to 49 USC \u00a7 13303(b) and 49 USC \u00a7 13304 as of January 1, 2005. Upon failure of any nonresident motor carrier to file a designation of agent as provided by this section, the nonresident motor carrier shall be conclusively considered to have designated the secretary of state as such agent. Service of process upon or acceptance or acknowledgment of the service by the secretary of state has the same legal force and validity as if duly served upon such nonresident carrier personally if notice of the service and a copy of the process are immediately sent by registered mail by the secretary of state, to the nonresident carrier, if the carrier's address be known. Service of the process upon the secretary of state shall be made by delivering to the secretary of state's office two copies of the process with a fee of three dollars to cover the costs of handling and mailing the process. Section 5. That \u00a7 49-28-36.5 be repealed. 49-28-36.5.

However, in no instance may any exempt motor carrier be required to purchase or display more than one identification stamp for any one motor vehicle. Failure of an exempt motor carrier to pay a minimum of one identification fee or a regulated motor carrier to register with a registration state on or before the thirty-first day of December of any year, shall result in the cancellation of registration and no further interstate movement may be permitted until the motor carrier has re-registered in accordance with the rules of the department. Section 6. That \u00a7 49-28-36.6 be repealed. 49-28-36.6. An interstate motor carrier who infrequently makes use of the state highways may, upon proof of satisfactory financial responsibility, elect to pay for a single trip permit in lieu of registering pursuant to \u00a7 49-28-36. The fee for the single trip permit is forty dollars. Section 7. That \u00a7 49-28-36.8 be repealed. 49-28-36.8. Upon payment of the single trip fee, as provided by \u00a7 49-28-36.6, the motor carrier shall be issued a receipt which shall be the trip permit. The carrier shall retain the permit in the carrier's possession for display upon demand of any agent, patrol officer, motor carrier enforcement officer, or motor carrier inspector of the Department of Public Safety.

A motor carrier shall maintain a copy of the permit in each of the motor carrier's motor vehicles. The copy of the permit shall be presented upon the request of any person who is hiring the motor carrier or the request of any law enforcement officer. A written warning, pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 32-21-29 and 32-21-30, may be issued by a law enforcement officer or motor carrier inspector for a violation of this section to a motor carrier who is unable to immediately produce a copy of the permit on request. If a citation is issued by a law enforcement officer or motor carrier inspector for a violation of this section and the motor carrier produces in the court of jurisdiction a copy of the permit which was valid at the time of demand, the action shall be dismissed. Section 9. That \u00a7 49-28-54 be repealed. 49-28-54.

Section 10. That \u00a7 49-28-55 be repealed. 49-28-55.
