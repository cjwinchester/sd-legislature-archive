WHEREAS, South Dakota is home to nine American Indian Tribes, including the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, the Crow Creek Sioux Tribe, the Flandreau Santee Sioux Tribe, the Lower Brule Sioux Tribe, the Oglala Sioux Tribe, the Rosebud Sioux Tribe, the Sisseton-Wahpeton Oyate, the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe, and the Yankton Sioux Tribe; and WHEREAS, the members of these tribes are South Dakota citizens, possess all the rights and privileges afforded by the state to its citizens, and comprise approximately nine percent of South Dakota's population; and WHEREAS, the State of South Dakota recognizes and supports the right of these nine tribal governments to exercise sovereign authority over their members and their territory. The State of South Dakota recognizes and respects the authority, rights, and sovereignty of tribal governments and endeavors to promote cooperation and good relations with the tribes residing within its borders; and WHEREAS, it is in the best interest of state and local governments to partner with tribal governments and to ensure that services and resources are available to all eligible citizens residing in tribal communities to the same extent that such services are available to all other eligible state citizens; and WHEREAS, a spirit of cooperation should guide the continuing government-to-government relationships between state and local governments and the tribes. Meaningful and timely consultation with South Dakota's tribal leaders based on respect, honesty, and understanding will facilitate better understanding and informed decision making; and WHEREAS, enhanced cooperation between state, local, and tribal governments can result in efficiency in the use of federal, state, and tribal dollars, saving litigation costs for all parties, and facilitating agreements between the tribes and state and local governments in such diverse areas as taxation, gaming, roads and bridges, law enforcement, rural fire services, health services, social services, child placement, corrections, agriculture, wildlife, hunting and fishing rights, water and natural resources, and many others: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the House of Representatives of the Eighty- fourth Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the Senate concurring therein, that the South Dakota Legislature endorses a policy of cooperation between tribal, state, and local governments and a commitment to fostering government-to-government relationships with tribal governments that will maintain open and free lines of communication for the discussion and resolution of conflicts and issues; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that state and local government agencies are urged to develop and implement tribal consultation policies to guide their work and interaction with tribal governments, so that state and local agencies seek input from appropriate tribal officials before undertaking actions or policies that may affect a tribal community or its members. Such agencies are urged to designate staff members to assume responsibility for the agency's tribal consultation policy and to act as the principal point of contact for tribal issues; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Legislature salutes and honors South Dakota's nine Indian tribes and all they have done to strengthen their communities. The Legislature reaffirms its recognition of the tribes' status as sovereign governments and the Legislature's commitment to interact with the tribes to promote intergovernmental cooperation, coordination, and communication on all matters."}, {"bill_id": 1097, "bill_version_id": 9287, "bill_version": "Enrolled", "bill_version_date": "2009-03-12T11:40:13.427-05:00", "bill_text": ""}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 1097, "action_date": "2009-03-09T14:00:00-05:00", "document_id": 8997, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/8997.pdf", "status_text": "First Reading", "journal_page": 714, "committee_id_action": 56, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 1097, "action_date": "2009-03-10T14:00:00-05:00", "document_id": 9153, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/9153.pdf", "status_text": "Adopt Resolution", "journal_page": 737, "committee_id_action": 56, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 5244, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [716, 720, 666, 676, 670, 726, 715, 699, 674, 635, 692, 708, 651, 643, 712, 709, 660, 706, 725, 693, 724, 727, 721, 652, 730, 672, 729, 717, 738, 654, 711, 683, 695, 696, 722, 637, 665, 687, 678, 646, 668, 735, 714, 731, 736, 713, 710, 728, 641, 658, 647, 691, 723, 718, 733, 732, 707, 681], "Nay": [688, 644, 737, 698, 645, 650, 639, 679, 734, 657, 684], "Excused": [719]}}, {"bill_id": 1097, "action_date": "2009-03-11T09:00:00-05:00", "document_id": 9213, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/9213.pdf", "status_text": "First Reading", "journal_page": 726, "committee_id_action": 54, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 1097, "action_date": "2009-03-12T10:00:00-05:00", "document_id": 9294, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/9294.pdf", "status_text": "Concurred in Resolution", "journal_page": 751, "committee_id_action": 54, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 5332, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [653, 704, 680, 682, 685, 702, 649, 700, 655, 673, 663, 677, 675, 634, 697, 659, 636, 667, 656, 669, 661, 686, 701, 662, 703, 664, 638, 648, 640, 689, 694, 705, 642, 671], "Excused": [690]}}]}
