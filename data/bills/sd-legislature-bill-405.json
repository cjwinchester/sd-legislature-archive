BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. Terms used in sections 2 to 14, inclusive, of this Act mean: (1) \"Department,\" the Department of Environment and Natural Resources; (2) \"Emergency,\" a condition at a petroleum refinery beyond the reasonable control of the owner or operator requiring immediate corrective action to restore normal and safe operation that is caused by a sudden, infrequent and not reasonably preventable equipment failure, natural disaster, act of war or terrorism or external power curtailment, excluding power curtailment due to an interruptible power service agreement from a utility; (3) \"Feasible,\" capable of being accomplished in a successful manner within a reasonable period of time, taking into account economic, environmental, legal, social and technological factors; (4) \"Flare,\" a combustion device that uses an open flame to burn combustible gases with combustion air provided by uncontrolled ambient air around the flame. This term includes both ground-level and elevated flares. If used as a verb, the term means the combustion of vent gas in a flare; (5) \"Flare minimization plan (FMP),\" a document intended to meet the requirements of section 3 of this Act; (6) \"Gas,\" the state of matter that has neither independent shape nor volume, but tends to expand indefinitely. The term includes aerosols. The terms, gas, and gases, are interchangeable; (7) \"Petroleum refinery,\" a facility that processes petroleum, as defined in the North American Industrial Classification Standard No. 32411 as of January 1, 2008, and including any associated sulfur recovery plant; (8) \"Prevention measure,\" a component, system, procedure, or program that will minimize or eliminate flaring; (9) \"Reportable flaring event,\" any flaring where more than five hundred thousand standard cubic feet per calendar day of vent gas is flared or where sulfur dioxide emissions are greater than five hundred pounds per day. For flares that are operated as a backup, staged or cascade system, the volume is determined on a cumulative basis; the total volume equals the total of vent gas flared at each flare in the system. For flaring lasting more than one calendar day, each day of flaring constitutes a separate flaring event unless the owner or operator demonstrates to the satisfaction of the department that the cause of flaring is the same for two or more consecutive days. A reportable flaring event ends when it can be demonstrated by monitoring required in section 13 of this Act that the integrity of the water seal has been maintained sufficiently to prevent vent gas to the flare tip. For flares without water seals or water seal monitors as required by section 13 of this Act a reportable flaring event ends when the rate of flow of vent gas falls below 0.5 feet per second; (10) \"Responsible manager,\" an employee of the facility or corporation who possesses sufficient authority to take the actions required for compliance with this Act; (11) \"Shutdown,\" the intentional cessation of a petroleum refining process unit or a unit operation within a petroleum refining process unit due to lack of feedstock or the need to conduct periodic maintenance, replacement of equipment, repair, or other operational requirements. A process unit includes subsets and components of the unit operation. Subsets and components includes reactors, heaters, vessels, columns, towers, pumps, compressors, exchangers, accumulators, valves, flanges, sample stations, pipelines, or sections of pipelines; (12) \"Startup,\" the setting into operation of a petroleum refining process unit for purposes of production. A process unit includes subsets and components of the unit operation. Subsets and components includes reactors, heaters, vessels, columns, towers, pumps, compressors, exchangers, accumulators, valves, flanges, sample stations, pipelines, or sections of pipelines; (13) \"Thermal oxidizer,\" an enclosed or partially enclosed combustion device, other than a flare, that is used to oxidize combustible gases; (14) \"Vent gas,\" any gas directed to a flare excluding assisting air or steam, flare pilot gas, and any continuous purge gases. Section 2. Flaring is prohibited unless it is consistent with an approved flare minimization plan and all commitments due under that plan have been met. This standard does not apply if the department determines, based on an analysis conducted in accordance with this Act, that the flaring is caused by an emergency and is necessary to prevent an accident, hazard, or release of vent gas directly to the atmosphere. Section 3. The owner or operator of a petroleum refinery with one or more flares subject to this Act shall submit to the department a flare minimization plan in accordance with the schedule in section 4 of this Act. The flare minimization plan shall be certified and signed by a responsible manager and shall include: (1) A description and technical information for each flare that is capable of receiving gases and the upstream equipment and processes that send gas to the flare including: (a) A detailed process flow diagram accurately depicting all pipelines, process units, flare gas recovery systems, water seals, surge drums and knock-out pots, compressors and other equipment that vent to each flare. At a minimum, this shall include full and accurate as-built dimensions and design capacities of the flare gas recovery systems, compressors, water seals, surge drums and knockout pots; and (b) Full and accurate descriptions including locations of all associated monitoring and control equipment; (2) A description of the equipment, processes, and procedures installed or implemented within the last five years to reduce flaring.

The evaluation shall include a review of flaring that has occurred during these activities in the past five years, and shall consider the feasibility of performing these activities without flaring; (b) Flaring that may reasonably be expected to occur due to issues of gas quantity and quality. The evaluation shall include an audit of the vent gas recovery capacity of each flare system, the storage capacity available for excess vent gases, and the scrubbing capacity available for vent gases including any limitations associated with scrubbing vent gases for use as a fuel; and shall consider the feasibility of reducing flaring through the recovery, treatment and use of the gas or other means; and (c) Flaring caused by the recurrent failure of air pollution control equipment, process equipment, or a process to operate in a normal or usual manner. The evaluation shall consider the adequacy of existing maintenance schedules and protocols for such equipment. For purposes of this section, a failure is recurrent if it occurs more than twice during any five year period as a result of the same cause as identified in accordance with section 11 of this Act; and (5) Any other information requested by the department as necessary to enable determination of compliance with applicable provisions of this Act. Failure to implement and maintain any equipment, processes, procedures or prevention measures in the flare minimization plan is a violation of this section. Section 4. The owner or operator of a petroleum refinery with one or more flares subject to this Act shall submit a flare minimization plan as required by section 3 of this Act. Section 5.

The public shall then have thirty days to submit comments on any consultants. The department shall consider any written comments received during this period prior to approving a consultant. The consultant shall be known as the flare minimization plan design and compliance auditor. Section 6. The flare minimization plan design and compliance auditor shall provide the department with timely reports as necessary for consideration in the department's completeness determinations, approvals, and disapprovals under section 8 of this Act. The department shall consider such reports in making its determinations under section 8 of this Act. Section 7. The department shall provide the flare minimization plan design and compliance auditor with all information required to be submitted by the owner or operator under sections 3 and 16 of this Act. The flare minimization plan design and compliance auditor shall provide the department with reports, comments or other information as necessary to determine compliance with section 2 of this Act, and sections 15 to 28, inclusive, of this Act, and such information shall be made available to the public upon request. The department shall consider the information submitted by the flare minimization plan design and compliance auditor in making any determinations under section 2 of this Act. Section 8. The procedure for determining whether the flare minimization plan meets the applicable requirements of this regulation is as follows: (1) Within forty-five days of receipt of the flare minimization plan, the department shall deem the plan complete if the department determines that it includes the information required by section 3 of this Act. In making its determination, the department shall consider any reports of the independent design auditor. If the department determines that the proposed flare minimization plan is not complete, the department shall notify the owner or operator in writing. The notification shall specify the basis for this determination and the required corrective action; (2) Upon receipt of such notification, the owner or operator shall correct the identified deficiencies and resubmit the proposed flare minimization plan within forty-five days. If the department determines that the owner or operator failed to correct any deficiency identified in the notification, the department shall disapprove the flare minimization plan; (3) The department shall publish notice of the availability of the complete flare minimization plan (with exception of confidential information) and make the flare minimization plan available to the public for sixty days. The department shall consider any written comments received during this period prior to approving or disapproving the flare minimization plan. The department shall reopen the public comment period to consider a revised flare minimization plan if a request is made demonstrating that an additional comment period is in the public interest; (4) Within forty-five days of the close of the public comment period, the department shall approve the flare minimization plan if the department determines that the plan meets the requirements of section 3 of this Act, and shall provide written notification to the owner or operator, as well as a brief response to all significant comments received from the public. This period may be extended if necessary to comply with state law. If the department determines that the flare minimization plan does not meet the requirements of section 3 of this Act, the department shall notify the owner or operator in writing. The notification shall specify the basis for this determination. Upon receipt of such notification, the owner or operator shall correct the identified deficiencies and resubmit the flare minimization plan within forty-five days. If the department determines that the owner or operator failed to correct any deficiency identified in the notification, the department shall disapprove the flare minimization plan. If the owner or operator submitted a complete flare minimization plan in accordance with section 3 of this Act, and the department has not disapproved the flare minimization plan under this section, the flare minimization plan shall be considered an approved flare minimization plan until the department takes final action. Section 9. The flare minimization plan shall be updated as follows: (1) No more than twelve months following approval of the original flare minimization plan and annually thereafter, the owner or operator of a flare subject to this Act shall review the flare minimization plan and revise the plan to incorporate any new prevention measures identified as a result of the analyses prescribed in section 3 of this Act. The updates shall be approved and signed by a responsible manager; (2) Prior to installing or modifying any equipment described in section 3 of this Act that requires a permit to operate, the owner or operator shall obtain an approved updated flare minimization plan addressing the new or modified equipment; (3) Annual flare minimization plan updates (with exception of confidential information) shall be made available to the public for thirty days. The department shall consider any written comments received during this period prior to approving or disapproving the update; (4) Within forty-five days of the close of the public comment period, the department shall approve the flare minimization plan update if the department determines that the update meets the requirements of section 3 of this Act, and shall provide written notification to the owner or operator. The previously approved flare minimization plan together with the approved update constitutes the approved plan for purposes of section 2 of this Act. This period may be extended if necessary to comply with state law. If the department determines that the flare minimization plan update does not meet the requirements of section 3 of this Act, the department shall notify the owner or operator in writing. The notification will specify the basis for this determination and the required corrective action. Upon receipt of such notification, the owner or operator shall correct the identified deficiencies and resubmit the flare minimization plan update within thirty days. If the department determines that the owner or operator failed to correct the deficiencies identified in the notification, the department shall disapprove the flare minimization plan update. For purposes of section 2 of this Act, disapproval of the update constitutes disapproval of the existing flare minimization plan, unless otherwise specified by the department. (5) If the owner or operator fails to submit a plan update as required by this section, the department shall provide written notification of the lapse. If the owner or operator fails to submit an update within thirty days of receipt of the notification, the existing flare minimization plan shall no longer be considered an approved plan for purposes of section 2 of this Act. Section 10. The owner or operator of a flare subject to this Act shall notify the department as soon as possible, consistent with safe operation of the refinery, if the volume of vent gas flared exceeds five hundred thousand standard cubic feet per calendar day. The notification, either by phone, fax or electronically, shall be in a format specified by the department and include the flare source name and number, the start date and time, and the end date and time. Section 11. The owner or operator of a flare subject to this Act shall submit a report to the department within sixty days following the end of the month in which a reportable flaring event occurs. The report shall be available to the public upon request and shall include the following: (1) The results of an investigation to determine the primary cause and contributing factors for the flaring event; (2) Any prevention measures that were considered or implemented to prevent recurrence together with a justification for rejecting any measures that were considered but not implemented; (3) If appropriate, an explanation of why the flaring is consistent with an approved flare minimization plan; (4) Where applicable, an explanation of why the flaring was an emergency and necessary to prevent an accident, hazard, or release of vent gas to the atmosphere or where, due to a regulatory mandate to vent to a flare, it cannot be recovered, treated and used as fuel gas at the refinery; and (5) The volume of vent gas flared, the calculated methane, non-methane hydrocarbon and sulfur dioxide emissions associated with the reportable flaring event. Section 12. When submitting the initial flare minimization plan, any updated flare minimization plan or any other report required by this Act, the owner or operator shall designate as confidential any information claimed to be exempt from public disclosure under chapter 1-27. If a document is submitted that contains information designated confidential in accordance with this section, the owner or operator shall provide a justification for this designation and shall submit a separate copy of the document with the information designated confidential redacted. Section 13. The owner or operator of a flare subject to this Act with a water seal shall continuously monitor and record the water level and pressure of the water seal that services each flare. Any new installation of a water seal shall be subject to this requirement immediately. Records of these measurements shall be retained for one year. Section 14. Monitoring devices required pursuant to section 13 of this Act shall be subject to the following reporting and record keeping requirements: (1) Parametric monitor periods of inoperation greater than twenty-four continuous hours shall be reported by the following working day, followed by notification of resumption of monitoring to the department; (2) Parametric monitor periods of inoperation shall not exceed fifteen consecutive days per incident or thirty calendar days per consecutive twelve-month period; (3) Any violation of permit conditions or department regulations to which the source is required to conform, as indicated by the monitor, shall be reported to the department within ninety-six hours after such occurrence.
