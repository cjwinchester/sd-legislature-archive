BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 10-13-40 be amended to read as follows: 10-13-40. To be eligible for a property classification pursuant to \u00a7 10-13-39, the owner of each owner-occupied dwelling, as defined in \u00a7 10-13-39, shall submit a certificate to the county director of equalization stating such person is the owner and occupant of the dwelling as of the assessment date pursuant to \u00a7 10-6-2. The owner shall state on the certificate the portion of the dwelling so occupied by the owner if it is less than fifty percent of the dwelling or if the dwelling is a duplex, triplex, or fourplex. The owner-occupant shall submit the certificate by March fifteenth. The owner of each manufactured or mobile home as defined in \u00a7 32-3-1, shall submit a certificate to the county director of equalization stating such person is the owner and occupant of the dwelling as of the assessment date. The owner-occupant of each manufactured or mobile home shall submit the certificate during the time of registration pursuant to \u00a7 \u00a7 10-9-3 to 10-9-4, inclusive. The owner-occupant shall sign the certificate under penalty of perjury. If the director of equalization classifies the property as owner-occupied single-family dwelling, it shall retain the classification until such time as the property ownership is transferred or the property has a change in use. The Department of Revenue shall prescribe the form of the certificate. Appeals regarding the owner-occupied classification shall be made directly to the county board of equalization pursuant to \u00a7 10-11-23. When considering the eligibility for owner-occupied classification the county board of equalization or a consolidated board of equalization organized pursuant to \u00a7 10-11-66 may waive the certificate filing deadline of March fifteenth and may grant owner-occupied classification if a certificate is filed by the third Tuesday in April and the property meets all other requirements of \u00a7 10-13-39 and this section."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 13725, "action_date": "1998-01-21T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 76895, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/76895.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 156, "committee_id_action": 600, "committee_id_assigned": 596, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 13725, "action_date": "1998-01-27T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 76578, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/76578.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 596, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 13725, "action_date": "1998-01-27T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 76578, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/76578.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass,", "journal_page": 253, "committee_id_action": 596, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 39862, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [2096, 2098, 2117, 2126, 2153, 2172, 2097, 2147, 2164, 2193, 2197, 2111], "Excused": [2168]}}, {"bill_id": 13725, "action_date": "1998-01-27T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 76578, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/76578.pdf", "status_text": "Place on Consent Calendar", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 596, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 13725, "action_date": "1998-01-28T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 76905, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/76905.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass,", "journal_page": 279, "committee_id_action": 600, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 40463, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [2096, 2098, 2100, 2101, 2104, 2105, 2106, 2107, 2108, 2109, 2110, 2111, 2113, 2117, 2119, 2120, 2123, 2124, 2126, 2127, 2128, 2131, 2132, 2133, 2136, 2139, 2141, 2143, 2144, 2146, 2147, 2150, 2151, 2152, 2153, 2154, 2157, 2158, 2159, 2160, 2161, 2162, 2163, 2164, 2167, 2168, 2171, 2172, 2173, 2174, 2176, 2177, 2178, 2180, 2181, 2183, 2184, 2185, 2186, 2190, 2192, 2193, 2194, 2195, 2197, 2198, 2134], "Excused": [2097, 2114, 2116]}}, {"bill_id": 13725, "action_date": "1998-01-29T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 76908, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/76908.pdf", "status_text": "First read in Senate and referred to", "journal_page": 250, "committee_id_action": 601, "committee_id_assigned": 584, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 13725, "action_date": "1998-02-11T08:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 76715, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/76715.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 584, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 13725, "action_date": "1998-02-11T08:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 76715, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/76715.pdf", "status_text": "Tabled", "journal_page": 444, "committee_id_action": 584, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 38576, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [2102, 2103, 2112, 2129, 2169, 2182], "Nay": [2155, 2187, 2170]}}, {"bill_id": 13725, "action_date": "1998-02-11T08:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 76715, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/76715.pdf", "status_text": "Tabled", "journal_page": 444, "committee_id_action": 584, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 38576, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [2102, 2103, 2112, 2129, 2169, 2182], "Nay": [2155, 2187, 2170]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/13725"}
