If the application is granted, the company may continue to offer its services. However, if the application is denied, the company shall cease and desist from offering any further services in this state. A telecommunications company has the burden to prove in its application that it has sufficient technical, financial and managerial capabilities to offer interexchange telecommunications services before the commission may grant a certificate of authority. The commission may rule upon a telecommunications company's application for a certificate of authority with or without hearing. Any certificate of authority granted by the commission may be suspended or revoked pursuant to chapter 1-26 for a willful violation of the laws of this state, a willful failure to comply with a rule or order of the commission, or other good cause. The commission shall, by rules promulgated pursuant to chapter 1-26, prescribe the necessary procedures to implement this section. A telecommunications company that had lawful authority immediately prior to July 1, 1992, shall continue to have such authority. The commission shall issue such a telecommunications company a certificate of authority.

No company may extend an existing telecommunications facility, outside its local exchange service area for the purpose of providing local exchange service, without applying to the commission for authority to do so. Section 9. That chapter 49-31 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: An application for a certificate of authority to provide local exchange service shall be filed with the commission, which shall have exclusive authority to grant the requested certificate. The application shall specify the types of services that are proposed, and shall include a plat or map identifying the specific geographic area for which the services are proposed. If an incumbent telecommunications company is providing local exchange services in a defined local calling area, the local calling area established by any additional certificate shall be coextensive with the already existing local calling area including any extended area service. Section 10. That chapter 49-31 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: An applicant seeking a certificate of authority to provide local exchange services shall provide a copy of the application at the time of filing to all incumbent telecommunications companies providing local exchange service in the area identified in the application. Incumbent telecommunications companies shall automatically have party status in any commission proceeding to consider the application. Section 11. That chapter 49-31 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: The commission may not grant the requested certificate of authority unless, after notice and opportunity for hearing, the applicant meets its burden of proving that it has the technical, managerial, and financial resources to provide the proposed local exchange service in the geographic area proposed to be served, and that the commission determines that the granting of the certificate of authority is consistent with the requirements of this chapter and any exemptions, suspensions or modifications authorized for incumbent local exchange service companies pursuant to 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 \u00a7 251(f)(1) and 251(f)(2) as of January 1, 1997. Any grant of a certificate authority to provide local exchange service shall be subject to such terms and conditions as the commission finds consistent with preserving and advancing universal service, protecting the public safety and welfare, ensuring the continued quality of service, and safeguarding the rights of consumers, including the nondiscriminatory availability of 911 or enhanced 911 service, access to a directory that includes the customers' local calling area, and access to local exchange service operators. Section 12. That chapter 49-31 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Except if an evidentiary hearing is required by the commission, the commission shall act on an application for a certificate of authority to provide local exchange service within ninety days of receiving a complete application. If an evidentiary hearing is required, the commission shall act on the application within one hundred twenty days of receipt of a complete application. The time periods for commission action may be extended for good cause, including the need to review interconnection agreements between or among affected companies to determine whether the certificate of authority is in the public interest. If an interconnection agreement is necessary to provide local exchange service, and that agreement has not been reviewed and approved by the commission as required by 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 252(e) as of January 1, 1997, approval of an application for a certificate shall be conditioned on the approval of the necessary interconnection agreement. Nothing in this section limits the right of an applicant to obtain an interconnection agreement while the application is pending. Section 13. That chapter 49-31 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: If the applicant proposes to provide any local exchange service in an area served by a rural telephone company, the applicant shall satisfy the service obligations of an eligible telecommunications carrier, unless the commission determines that the requirement is not in the public interest and a waiver is granted by the commission pursuant to section 14 of this Act. For purposes of this section an eligible telecommunications carrier shall, in addition to satisfying the conditions in section 11 of this Act, provide some or all of the facilities necessary to provide local exchange service; provide all services supported by federal universal service support mechanisms; provide single-line residential and business local exchange service using the same local calling area, including any extended area service, as the incumbent rural telephone company; provide inter and intra-LATA equal access to same extent provided by the incumbent rural telephone company; provide the required services at prices and terms which reflect a good faith offering of service throughout the service area of the incumbent rural telephone company; and advertise the availability of its local exchange services and its prices to all potential customers throughout the service area using media of general distribution. Section 14. That chapter 49-31 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: An applicant may petition the commission for a waiver from the requirement of satisfying the service obligations of an eligible telecommunications carrier where the incumbent rural telephone company has obtained an exemption, suspension, or modification under 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 251(f) as of January 1, 1997, which effectively prevents an applicant from meeting those obligations or where the commission determines, after notice and hearing pursuant to chapter 1-26, that the waiver would be in the public interest, that it would not adversely impact universal service, that prices for local exchange service will be just, reasonable and affordable, and that quality of service will be continued. Section 15. That chapter 49-31 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Any telecommunications company seeking to amend or alter its authorized local exchange service territory shall apply for an amended certificate of authority. An application for an amended certificate shall be subject to the same requirements as an application for an initial certificate. Section 16. That chapter 49-31 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: An application for a certificate of authority to provide local exchange service shall be accompanied by a fee of two hundred fifty dollars, which shall be deposited in the gross receipts tax fund established pursuant to \u00a7 49-1A-2. Section 17. That chapter 49-31 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Any certificate of authority in effect as of the effective date of the Act shall remain in full force and effect. Section 18. That chapter 49-31 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Any certificate of authority may be suspended or revoked by the commission pursuant to chapter 1-26 for a violation of the laws of this state, failure to comply with a rule or order of the commission, or other good cause including a failure to provide reasonably adequate service and, if customers have a choice of providers, degradation of service quality affecting customers served by another company. The commission may order a partial suspension or revocation for less than the entire area served. Section 19. That chapter 49-31 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: A certificate of authority may not be sold, assigned, leased or transferred without authority from the commission. The offering of local exchange service without a certificate of authority or otherwise inconsistent with this section is a Class 1 misdemeanor. Section 20. That chapter 49-31 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: The commission may promulgate rules necessary to implement this sections 9 to 19, inclusive, of this Act. Section 21. That chapter 49-31 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: A local exchange service reseller is not an independent telecommunications company as that term is used in \u00a7 49-31-5.1. Section 22. That \u00a7 49-31-3.2 be amended to read as follows: 49-31-3.2. The commission, after notice and hearing, shall waive, eliminate or modify any of its rules or orders affecting telecommunications services if it finds that a telecommunications service is a fully competitive service or an emerging competitive service. A person, or the commission on its own motion, may apply to have an emerging competitive service of a telecommunications company classified as a fully competitive service or a noncompetitive service classified as an emerging competitive service or a fully competitive service. The application may be distinguished by or limited to a particular locality or market where the service faces a demonstrated level of competition. The application shall be filed with the commission and served on any other person designated by the commission. The application shall be in a form prescribed by the commission. The commission, in determining how a telecommunications service is to be classified, shall consider: (1) The number and size of alternative providers of the service and the affiliation to other providers; (2) The extent to which services are available from alternative providers in the relevant market; (3) The ability of alternative providers to make functionally equivalent or substitute services readily available at competitive rates, terms, and conditions of service; (4) The market share, the ability of the market to hold prices close to cost, and other economic measures of market power; and (5) The impact on universal service. The commission shall approve or deny any such application within ninety days after the filing of the application. However, the commission may, by order, defer the period within which it must act for one additional period of ninety days, upon a finding that the proceeding cannot be completed within ninety days and that the additional time period is necessary for the commission to adequately and completely fulfill its duty under this title. If the commission has not acted on any such application within the appropriate time period permitted, the application shall be deemed granted. Section 23. That \u00a7 49-31-3.3 be repealed. 49-31-3.3. The commission may, within ninety days after July 1, 1988, conclude an investigation into any or all of the telecommunications services listed in \u00a7 \u00a7 49-31-1.1, 49-31-1.2 and 49-31-1.3 to determine if any service is properly classified pursuant to the standards found in subdivisions 49-31-3.2 (1) to (5), inclusive. The commission may, after notice and hearing, reclassify any service to conform the classification of the service to the evidence and the standards in \u00a7 49-31-3.2. The telecommunications company providing the service has the burden of proving the classification is appropriate. During this ninety-day period, any service subject to the investigation will remain under rate of return regulation. Upon expiration of the ninety-day period, reclassification of any service, even if hearings had commenced within the ninety days, will be pursuant to the provisions of \u00a7 49-31-3.4. Section 24. That \u00a7 49-31-4 be amended to read as follows: 49-31-4. Any charge established for the provision of telecommunications services shall be fair and reasonable. The commission shall determine and approve individual rates prices to be charged by any telecommunications company for a noncompetitive service pursuant to under price regulation as defined in \u00a7 49-31-1.4, if applicable, and pursuant to \u00a7 \u00a7 49-31-12, 49-31-12.2 and 49-31-12.4. Except as provided in \u00a7 49-31-4.1, the commission shall utilize rate of return regulation when determining the charge for a noncompetitive service. The commission shall determine and approve individual prices to be charged by a telecommunications company for any emerging competitive service pursuant to \u00a7 \u00a7 49-31-1.4, 49-31-12, 49-31-12.2, and 49-31-12.5. However, there is no rate of return regulation of emerging competitive services and no rate of return or price regulation of fully competitive services. The commission shall separate, assign and distribute a telecommunications company's revenues, investments, and expenses among all services offered. The commission shall, by rules promulgated pursuant to chapter 1-26, prescribe the methodologies by which a telecommunications company shall segregate its revenues, investments and expenses. The methodologies prescribed by the rules shall be in accord with federal and state law. No telecommunications company may use the revenues from emerging competitive services to subsidize fully competitive services or revenues from noncompetitive services to subsidize emerging competitive services or fully competitive services. Expenses and investment of fully competitive services may not be attributed to emerging competitive services or noncompetitive services and the expenses and investment of emerging competitive services may not be attributed to noncompetitive services. Rates being charged by a telecommunications company on July 1, 1988 shall be deemed to be the fair, reasonable, and effective rates until changed or altered pursuant to this chapter. Section 25.

Within thirty days of its receipt of a petition filed pursuant to this section, the commission shall issue a procedural schedule setting forth dates by which written direct testimony or data shall be filed and ordering the date for commencement of a hearing. If the investigation indicates that pricing regulation is appropriate for any noncompetitive service because such regulation has a positive impact on universal service and is more reasonable and fair than rate of return regulation, the commission may adopt pricing regulation for any such noncompetitive service. Section 26. That \u00a7 49-31-4.2 be repealed. 49-31-4.2. A telecommunications company providing intrastate interexchange telecommunications services shall charge uniform prices on all routes where it offers the services. However, notwithstanding this section and \u00a7 49-31-11, a telecommunications company may offer or provide volume discounts and may pass through any state, municipal or local taxes in the specific geographic areas from which the taxes originate.

The application shall have attached thereto a plat or map showing the location of the proposed facility. Upon receipt of the application, the commission shall notify any other telecommunications company which may be affected and permit the filing of comments or objections. The commission may allow, with or without a hearing, the construction of a telecommunications facility if it finds the facility to be in the public interest and which will provide competition in the delivery or use of telecommunications services. If the proposed location of a facility is in the local exchange territory assigned to telephone cooperatives organized pursuant to chapters 47-15 to 47-20, inclusive, or municipal telephone systems operated pursuant to chapter 9-41, or independent telephone companies serving less than ten thousand local exchange subscribers, the commission may allow the proposed facility only upon the additional finding that the local exchange company operating the existing facility is not furnishing reasonably adequate telecommunications service and will not furnish reasonably adequate service within a reasonable time. Nothing in this section prohibits the construction of nonaccess facilities which cross the local exchange territory being lawfully occupied and served by another telecommunications company furnishing reasonably adequate service. Nothing in this section affects construction or extension of facilities within the local exchange territory for which a company has the certificate to operate, into contiguous territory which is not receiving similar service, or where a certificated telecommunications company agrees in writing to an attachment of lines or to the construction of telecommunications facilities in the affected company's local exchange territory.

Parties may also, consistent with federal law, petition the commission to appoint an arbitrator to resolve open issues in the negotiations. The commission may appoint mediators or arbitrators. In establishing any prices for interconnection and unbundled network services, the commission shall ensure that the prices are cost based. Section 48. That chapter 49-31 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: The aggregate price for unbundled network service may exceed the price for a bundled service that includes the network services, if necessary to satisfy the requirement that a local exchange company providing the network services may not be required to provide service below cost. A telecommunications company that purchases the local loop unbundled from the switching service shall pay a price which covers all costs regardless of jurisdiction. In those instances where a telecommunications company desires to use facilities of another company that are used to provide extended area service, it shall negotiate an interconnection agreement with the local exchange company where the traffic originates and the company where the traffic terminates. Prices for unbundled network services may be deaveraged to reflect cost differences only if corresponding retail services prices may also be deaveraged to reflect cost differences unless some cost support mechanism such as a universal service fund is in place which offsets the need for deaveraged retail prices.

Local exchange companies participating in the joint ownership, operation or sharing arrangement may not be treated as a common carrier for hire or as offering common carrier services with respect to any infrastructure, technology, information, facilities or functions made available to an eligible telecommunications carrier under the arrangement. Section 51. That chapter 49-31 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: It is not unreasonable or discriminatory for a telecommunications company to impose the following conditions or limitations on the resale of its services: (1) A limitation which does not allow the resale of residential local exchange service to any other category of class of customer; (2) A limitation which does not allow the resale at wholesale prices of services to a different category or class of customer than that category or class of customer for which the service is available at retail prices; (3) A limitation that does not allow the use of flat or measured rate local exchange service or the existence of a local calling area to bypass the use of switched access; (4) A requirement that services offered at a discounted retail price by a local exchange company may be resold only to those customers eligible for the retail discount from the local exchange company; (5) A requirement that does not allow a local exchange service company to provide a retail service, which is priced below the full actual cost of providing the service, at a discount that represents the costs that will be avoided as described in 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 252(d)(3) as of January 1, 1997.

Cost proxies shall reasonably recognize the cost differences between companies that result from different customer densities, loop lengths, and number of customers served. The commission may upon request grant waivers allowing eligible telecommunications carriers to submit a cost study demonstrating the actual cost of providing the identified services as an alternative to the use of cost proxies where it is shown that the applicable proxies do not fairly reflect the costs incurred to provide the identified services. Section 57. That chapter 49-31 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: The commission shall also develop affordability prices for the identified services. The commission shall establish different affordability prices for rural telephone companies. Any company whose local service is regulated by the commission shall be permitted to charge prices at least up to the affordability level established by the commission.

The percentage shall be rounded to the nearest tenth of one percent. Section 62. That chapter 49-31 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Telecommunications service providers will remit monthly to the fund administrator the difference between the amount owed to the fund and the amount due to the eligible telecommunications carrier from the fund.

BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That chapter 49-31 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: It is the intent of the Legislature that South Dakota have a telecommunications infrastructure that meets the advanced communication needs of the state's individual citizens and its communities of interest, including our schools, medical facilities, businesses, and all levels of government. To achieve this intent, three networks, accessible by all South Dakotans, will be established: a narrowband network, a wideband network, and a broadband network. Together, these three networks will form South Dakota's Public Communications Network Infrastructure. This infrastructure will enable any-to-any voice, data, videoconferencing, graphics, imaging, and multimedia communications. These three networks will fully support the following capability requirements: ubiquitous, feature rich, standard, secure, private, survivable, robust, addressable, switched, symmetric, affordable, and available. Communications services will be reasonably and affordably priced to promote the growth and usage of each of these three networks, leveraging the power of technology to provide ever-increasing bandwidths at ever- diminishing cost of facilities. Classes of service will be created for network services in order to establish a service-based and value-based pricing model. The new narrowband, wideband, and broadband communications networks will be established in a manner ensuring that all the citizens of South Dakota realize the advantages of the forthcoming information age, including economic development, educational opportunities, a heightened level of medical care, and better, more efficient service from all levels of government.
