Section 5. A person whose religious exercise is substantially burdened in violation of this Act may assert that violation as a claim or defense in a judicial proceeding and obtain appropriate relief against a government. A party who prevails in any action to enforce this chapter against a government shall recover attorney's fees and costs. Section 6. This Act applies to all state laws and local ordinances and the implementation of those laws and ordinances, whether statutory or otherwise, and whether enacted or adopted before, on or after the effective date of this Act. Section 7. This Act may not be construed to authorize any government to substantially burden any religious belief. Section 8.
