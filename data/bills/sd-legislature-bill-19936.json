BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. Terms used in this Act mean: (1) \"Action,\" any civil lawsuit, judicial action, or arbitration proceeding asserting a claim, in whole or in part, for damages or other relief in connection with a dwelling, caused by an alleged construction defect; (2) \"Association,\" a corporation formed for the purpose of exercising the powers of the members of any common interest community; (3) \"Claimant,\" any one who asserts a claim concerning a construction defect. Section 2. For the purposes of this Act, the term, construction defect, has the meaning assigned by a written, express warranty either provided by the contractor or required by applicable statutory law. If no written, express warranty or applicable statutory warranty provides a definition, then the term means a matter concerning the design, construction, or repair of a dwelling, of an alteration of or repair or addition to an existing dwelling, or of an appurtenance to a dwelling, on which a person has a complaint against a contractor. The term may include any physical damage to the dwelling, any appurtenance, or the real property on which the dwelling or appurtenance are affixed, proximately caused by a construction defect. Section 3. For the purposes of this Act, the term, contractor, means any person, firm, partnership, corporation, association, or other organization that is engaged in the business of designing, developing, constructing, or selling dwellings, or the alteration of or addition to an existing dwelling, repair of a new or existing dwelling, or construction, sale, alteration, addition, or repair of an appurtenance to a new or existing dwelling. The term includes: (1) An owner, officer, director, shareholder, partner, or employee of the contractor; (2) A subcontractor or supplier of labor and materials used by a contractor in a dwelling; and (3) A risk retention group registered under applicable law, if any, that insures all or any part of a contractor's liability for the cost to repair a construction defect. Section 4. For the purposes of this Act, the term, dwelling, means a single-family house, duplex, or multifamily unit designed for residential use in which title to each individual unit is transferred to the owner under a condominium or cooperative system and shall include common areas and improvements that are owned or maintained by an association or by members of an association. The term includes the systems, other components, improvements, other structures, or recreational facilities that are appurtenant to the house, duplex, or multifamily unit at the time of its initial sale, but not necessarily a part of the house, duplex, or multifamily unit. Section 5. For the purposes of this Act, the term, serve, or the term, service, means delivery by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the last known address of the addressee. For a corporation, limited partnership, limited liability company, or other registered business organization, it means service on the registered agent or other agent for service of process authorized by the laws of this state. Section 6. If a claimant files an action without first complying with the requirements of this Act, on application by a party to the action, the court or arbitrator shall dismiss the action, without prejudice, and the action may not be refiled or resumed until the claimant has complied with the requirements of this Act. To the extent that the action includes a cause of action for damages due to personal injury or death, such cause of action is not subject to dismissal pursuant to this section. Section 7. In every action subject to this Act, the claimant shall, no later than ninety days before initiating an action against a contractor, provide service of written notice of claim on that contractor. The notice of claim shall state that the claimant asserts a construction defect claim and is providing notice of the claim pursuant to the requirements of this Act. The notice of claim shall describe the claim in detail sufficient to explain the nature of the alleged construction defects and the results of the defects. In addition, the claimant shall provide to the contractor any evidence that depicts the nature and cause of the construction defect, including expert reports, photographs, and videotapes, if that evidence would be discoverable under this state's evidentiary rules. If, after proper request, the claimant fails to provide such evidence, the claimant may not introduce any such evidence not produced into evidence in any action. Section 8. Within thirty days after service of the notice of claim by the claimant required in section 7 of this Act, each contractor that has received the notice of claim may serve on the claimant, and on any other contractor that has received the notice of claim, a written response to the claim or claims, which either: (1) Offers to settle the claim by monetary payment, the making of repairs, or a combination of both, without inspection; or (2) Proposes to inspect the dwelling that is the subject of the claim. Section 9. If the contractor wholly rejects the claim and neither remedies the alleged construction defect nor settles the claim, or does not respond to the claimant's notice of claim within the time stated in section 8 of this Act, the claimant may bring an action against the contractor for the claims described in the notice of claim without further notice except as otherwise provided under applicable law. Section 10. If the claimant rejects the settlement offer made by the contractor, the claimant shall provide written notice of the claimant's rejection to the contractor and, if represented by legal counsel, the contractor's attorney. The notice shall include the specific factual and, if known, legal reasons, for the claimant's rejection of the contractor's proposal or offer. If the claimant believes that the settlement offer omits reference to any portion of the claim, or was unreasonable in any manner, the claimant shall in the written notice include those items that the claimant believes were omitted and set forth in detail all reasons why the claimant believes the settlement offer is unreasonable. In any subsequent action where the claimant asserts that the settlement offer was unreasonable, the claimant may not raise any reasons that were not included in its response to the contractor. Section 11. If a proposal for inspection is made pursuant to subdivision (2) of section 8 of this Act, the claimant shall, within thirty days of receiving the contractor's proposal, provide the contractor and its subcontractors, agents, experts, and consultants prompt and complete access to the dwelling to inspect the dwelling, document any alleged construction defects, and perform any destructive or nondestructive testing required to fully and completely evaluate the nature, extent, and cause of the claimed defects and the nature and extent of any repairs or replacements that may be necessary to remedy the alleged defects. If destructive testing is required, the contractor shall give the claimant advance notice of the tests and shall, after completion of the testing, return the dwelling to its pre-testing condition. If any inspection or testing reveals a condition that requires additional testing to allow the contractor to fully and completely evaluate the nature, cause, and extent of the construction defect, the contractor shall provide notice to the claimant of the need for such additional testing. The claimant shall provide access as set forth in this section. If a claim is asserted on behalf of owners of multiple dwellings, or multiple owners of units within a multifamily complex, the contractor may inspect each of the dwellings or units. Section 12. Within fourteen days following completion of the inspection and testing pursuant to section 11 of this Act, the contractor may serve on the claimant: (1) A written offer to fully or partially remedy the construction defect at no cost to the claimant. The offer shall include a description of any additional construction necessary to remedy the defect described in the claim, and an anticipated timetable for the completion of the construction; (2) A written offer to settle the claim by monetary payment; (3) A written offer including a combination of repairs and monetary payment; or (4) A written statement that the contractor will not proceed further to remedy the defect. Section 13. If a claimant accepts a contractor's offer made pursuant to subdivision (1) or (2) of section 12 of this Act and the contractor does not proceed to make the monetary payment or remedy the construction defect within the agreed timetable, the claimant may bring an action against the contractor for the claim described in the notice of claim without further notice except as otherwise provided by applicable law. In such situation, the claimant may also file the contractor's offer and the claimant's acceptance. An offer and acceptance creates a rebuttable presumption that a binding and valid settlement agreement has been created and should be enforced by the court or arbitrator. Section 14. If a claimant receives a written statement that the contractor will not proceed further to remedy the defect, the claimant may bring an action against the contractor for the claim described in the notice of claim without further notice except as otherwise provided by applicable law. Section 15. If the claimant rejects the offer made by the contractor to remedy the construction defect or to settle the claim by monetary payment or a combination of each, the claimant shall serve written notice of the claimant's rejection on the contractor. The notice shall include the specific factual and, if known, legal reasons for the claimant's rejection of the contractor's offer. If the claimant believes the contractor's settlement offer is unreasonable, the claimant shall set forth in detail all reasons why the claimant believes the settlement offer is unreasonable. In any subsequent action where the claimant asserts that the settlement offer was unreasonable, the claimant may not raise any reasons that were not included in its response to the contractor. Section 16. Upon receipt of a claimant's rejection and the reasons for the rejection, the contractor may, within fifteen days of receiving the rejection, make a supplemental offer of repair or monetary payment, or both, to the claimant. Section 17. If the claimant rejects the supplemental offer made by the contractor to remedy the construction defect or to settle the claim by monetary payment or a combination of each, the claimant shall serve written notice of the claimant's rejection on the contractor. The notice shall include the specific factual and, if known, legal reasons for the claimant's rejection of the contractor's supplemental settlement offer. If the claimant believes the contractor's supplemental settlement offer is unreasonable, the claimant shall set forth in detail all reasons why the claimant believes the supplemental settlement offer is unreasonable. In any subsequent action where the claimant asserts that the supplemental settlement offer was unreasonable, the claimant may not raise any reasons that were not included in its response to the contractor. Section 18. If a claimant rejects a reasonable offer, including any reasonable supplemental offer, made as provided by this Act or does not permit the contractor to repair the construction defect pursuant to an accepted offer of settlement, the claimant may not recover an amount in excess of: (1) The fair market value of the offer of settlement, or the actual cost of the repairs made, whichever is less; or (2) The amount of a monetary offer of settlement. For purposes of this section, the trier of fact shall determine the reasonableness of an offer of settlement made pursuant to this section. If the claimant has rejected a reasonable offer, including any reasonable supplemental offer, and any other law allows the claimant to recover costs and attorneys' fees, the claimant may recover no costs or attorneys' fees incurred after the date of its rejection. Section 19. Any claimant accepting the offer of the contractor to remedy a construction defect shall do so by serving the contractor with a written notice of acceptance within a reasonable period of time after receipt of the contractor's settlement offer, but no later than thirty days after receipt of the offer. If no response is served upon the contractor within the thirty-day period, then the offer shall be deemed accepted. Section 20. If a claimant accepts a contractor's offer to repair a construction defect described in a notice of claim, the claimant shall provide the contractor and its subcontractors, agents, experts, and consultants prompt and unfettered access to the dwelling to perform and complete the construction by the timetable stated in the settlement offer. Section 21. If, during the pendency of the notice, inspection, offer, acceptance, or repair process, an applicable limitations period would otherwise expire, the claimant may file an action against the contractor, but the action shall be immediately abated pending completion of the notice of claim process described in this section. This section may not be construed to revive a statute of limitations period that has expired prior to the date on which a claimant's written notice of claim is served, or to extend any applicable statute of repose. Section 22. After the sending of the initial notice of claim, a claimant and a contractor may, by written mutual agreement, alter the procedure for the notice of claim process described in this Act. Section 23. In an action relating to a dwelling involving a construction defect, a contractor is not liable for damages involving or caused by: (1) Normal shrinkage due to drying or settlement of construction components within the tolerance of building standards; (2) The contractor's reliance on written information relating to the dwelling that was obtained from official government records or provided by a government entity; (3) Any construction defect known by or disclosed to a claimant in writing before the claimant's purchase of the dwelling; (4) If the claimant is not the first owner of the dwelling, any construction defect known by the claimant or that could have been discovered by the claimant through the exercise of reasonable diligence prior the claimant's purchase of the dwelling; or (5) Refusal of anyone to allow the contractor or contractor's agents to perform their warranty service work. Section 24. A construction defect that is discovered after a claimant has provided a contractor with the initial claim notice may not be alleged in an action until the claimant has given the contractor who performed the original construction: (1) Written notice of claim regarding the alleged defect as required by section 7 of this Act; and (2) An opportunity to resolve the notice of claim in the manner provided in sections 8 to 23, inclusive, of this Act. Section 25. If a claimant accepts an offer made in compliance with this Act and the contractor fulfills the offer in compliance with this Act, the claimant shall thereafter be barred from bringing an action for the claim described in the notice of claim. Performance of repairs or payment of money to a claimant by a contractor under an accepted offer made pursuant to this Act does not, by itself, create insurance coverage or otherwise affect an insurer's obligations under a contractor's liability insurance policy or, by itself, be considered a voluntary payment of an otherwise valid insured claim according to the terms and conditions of the contractor's liability insurance policy. Section 26. Upon entering into a contract for sale, construction, or improvement of a dwelling, the contractor shall provide notice to the owner of the dwelling of the contractor's right to resolve alleged construction defects before a claimant may commence litigation against the contractor. The notice shall be conspicuous and may be included as part of the contract. Section 27. The notice required by section 26 of this Act shall be in substantially the following form: {State Law} CONTAINS IMPORTANT REQUIREMENTS YOU MUST FOLLOW BEFORE YOU MAY FILE A LAWSUIT OR OTHER ACTION FOR DEFECTIVE CONSTRUCTION AGAINST THE CONTRACTOR WHO CONSTRUCTED YOUR HOME. NINETY DAYS BEFORE YOU FILE YOUR LAWSUIT OR OTHER ACTION, YOU MUST SERVE ON THE CONTRACTOR A WRITTEN NOTICE OF ANY CONSTRUCTION CONDITIONS YOU ALLEGE ARE DEFECTIVE. UNDER THE LAW, A CONTRACTOR HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE AN OFFER TO REPAIR OR PAY FOR THE DEFECTS, OR BOTH. YOU ARE NOT OBLIGATED TO ACCEPT ANY OFFER MADE BY A CONTRACTOR. THERE ARE STRICT DEADLINES AND PROCEDURES UNDER STATE LAW, AND FAILURE TO FOLLOW THEM MAY AFFECT YOUR ABILITY TO FILE A LAWSUIT OR OTHER ACTION. Section 28. This Act applies to all actions commenced after the effective date, regardless of the date of sale or substantial completion of the dwelling at issue in the action. Section 29. No person may provide or offer to provide anything of value, directly or indirectly, to a property manager of an association or to a member or officer of an association to induce the property manager, member, or officer to encourage or discourage the association to file a claim for damages arising from a construction defect. A violation of this section is a Class 2 misdemeanor. Section 30. No property manager retained by an association may accept anything of value, directly or indirectly, in exchange for encouraging or discouraging the association that he or she manages to file a claim for damages arising from a construction defect. A violation of this section is a Class 2 misdemeanor. Section 31. No member or officer of an association may accept anything of value, directly or indirectly, in exchange for encouraging or discouraging the association of which he or she is a member or officer to file a claim for damages arising from a construction defect. A violation of this section is a Class 2 misdemeanor. Section 32. An association may bring an action against a contractor to recover damages resulting from construction defects in any of the common elements or limited common elements of the common-interest community only. The action may be maintained only after: (1) The association first obtains the written approval of each unit's owner whose interest in the common elements or limited common elements will be the subject of the action; (2) A vote of the units' owners to which at least a majority of the votes of the members of the association are allocated; (3) The full board of directors of the association and the contractor have met in person and conferred in a good faith attempt to resolve the association's claim, or the contractor has definitively declined or ignored the requests to meet with the board of directors of the association; and (4) The association has otherwise satisfied all of the pre-action requirements for a claimant to commence an action as set forth in this section. Section 33. At least three business days in advance of any vote to commence an action by an association to recover damages resulting from construction defects in any of the common elements or limited common elements of the common-interest community, the attorney representing the association shall provide to each unit's owner a written statement that includes, in reasonable detail: (1) The defects and damages or injuries to the common elements or limited common elements; (2) The cause of the defects, if the cause is known; (3) The nature and the extent that is known of the damage or injury resulting from the defects; (4) The location of each defect within the common elements or limited common elements, if known; (5) A reasonable estimate of the cost of the action or mediation, including reasonable attorney's fees and costs, expert fees, and the costs of testing; and (6) All disclosures that the unit owner is required to make upon the sale of the unit. Section 34. No association or an attorney for an association may employ a person to perform destructive tests to determine any damage or injury to a unit, common element or limited common element caused by a construction defect unless: (1) The person is licensed as a contractor pursuant to applicable law, if any; (2) The association has obtained the prior written approval of each unit's owner whose unit or interest in the common element or limited common element will be affected by such testing; (3) The person performing the tests has provided a written schedule for repairs; (4) The person performing the tests is required to repair all damage resulting from such tests in accordance with state laws and local ordinances relating thereto; (5) The association or the person so employed obtains all permits required to conduct such tests and to repair any damage resulting from such tests; and (6) Reasonable prior notice and opportunity to observe the tests is given to the contractor against whom an action may be brought as a result of the tests. Section 35. An association may commence an action only upon a vote or written agreement of the owners of the units to which at least a majority of the votes of the members of the association are allocated. In such a case, the association shall provide written notice to the owner of each unit of the meeting at which the commencement of an action is to be considered or action is to be taken at least twenty-one calendar days before the meeting. Section 36. The board of directors of an association may, without giving notice to the units' owners , employ a contractor and such other persons as are necessary to make such immediate repairs to a unit or common element within the common-interest community as are required to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the units' owners. Section 37. Nothing in this Act creates any cause of action on behalf of any claimant or contractor. Section 38. This Act does not apply to a contractor's right to seek contribution, indemnity, or recovery against a subcontractor, supplier, or design professional for any claim made against a contractor by a claimant."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 19936, "action_date": "2005-01-31T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 103721, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/103721.pdf", "status_text": "First read in Senate and referred to", "journal_page": 246, "committee_id_action": 861, "committee_id_assigned": 839, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 19936, "action_date": "2005-02-09T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 104428, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/104428.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 839, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 19936, "action_date": "2005-02-09T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 104428, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/104428.pdf", "status_text": "Tabled", "journal_page": 415, "committee_id_action": 839, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 59782, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [3179, 3201, 3202, 3205, 3217, 3150], "Excused": [3236]}}]}
