WHEREAS, the United States Congress is currently considering an increase in federal regulations and penalties that dictate miles-per-gallon standards for American manufactured car and truck fleets, called Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards; and WHEREAS, CAFE standards, started in 1975 in reaction to the Arab Oil Embargo, failed to achieve its stated goals, other than to arbitrarily increase the prices business, farming, construction, and consumers pay to purchase competent light trucks and cars which are essential to their livelihoods and safety; and WHEREAS, additional increases in the CAFE standards and penalties will force additional costs without exempting vehicles which are essential to agriculture, workers, and business; and WHEREAS, South Dakota's harsh climate and the stress of agricultural, construction and business uses of vehicles require larger, more powerful pickups and light trucks; and WHEREAS, forcing drivers into small, low-powered vehicles which are not competent for South Dakota's harsh weather and driving conditions will increase the hazards of accidental injury and death; and WHEREAS, reducing consumer choice and forcing consumers out of safe dependable cars and light trucks will have a corrosive effect on family-based tourism in South Dakota and on hunting and fishing access in South Dakota; and WHEREAS, Congress should more aggressively pursue productive and incentive-based measures to lower dependence on foreign oil by vastly increasing the production and consumption of renewable fuels which would help to rebuild America's farm economy and create value-added businesses in South Dakota and to seek other sources of energy for transportation such as fuel cell development: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the Senate of the Seventy-seventh Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the House of Representatives concurring therein, that the South Dakota delegation in the United States Congress is encouraged to oppose any increase in the CAFE standards and penalties which would result in harm to farming, business, construction, tourism, and consumers of South Dakota and to view the additional penalties as a punitive tax on South Dakota's economy."}, {"bill_id": 17510, "bill_version_id": 94907, "bill_version": "Enrolled", "bill_version_date": "2002-02-22T16:19:39-06:00", "bill_text": ""}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 17510, "action_date": "2002-02-20T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 94747, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/94747.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to another day", "journal_page": 643, "committee_id_action": 769, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 17510, "action_date": "2002-02-21T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 94848, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/94848.pdf", "status_text": "Adopt Resolution", "journal_page": 652, "committee_id_action": 769, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 52898, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [2726], "Excused": [2727, 2739, 2743, 2747, 2750, 2760, 2778, 2787, 2802, 2809, 2821], "Yea": [2730, 2733, 2734, 2740, 2742, 2745, 2746, 2753, 2761, 2762, 2772, 2780, 2784, 2791, 2792, 2795, 2796, 2810, 2818, 2819, 2827, 2828, 2829]}}, {"bill_id": 17510, "action_date": "2002-02-22T09:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 94934, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/94934.pdf", "status_text": "Concur In resolution", "journal_page": 829, "committee_id_action": 768, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 54344, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [2724, 2725, 2728, 2729, 2731, 2732, 2736, 2738, 2741, 2744, 2748, 2749, 2752, 2754, 2755, 2756, 2757, 2763, 2765, 2766, 2767, 2769, 2770, 2771, 2774, 2775, 2777, 2779, 2781, 2782, 2783, 2786, 2788, 2789, 2790, 2793, 2794, 2797, 2798, 2799, 2804, 2805, 2806, 2807, 2811, 2813, 2814, 2815, 2816, 2817, 2820, 2822, 2823, 2824, 2825, 2826, 2830, 2751], "Excused": [2735, 2768, 2773, 2808, 2812], "Absent": [2737], "Nay": [2758, 2759, 2764, 2785, 2800, 2803]}}]}
