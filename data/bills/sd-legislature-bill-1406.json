A student whose cumulative grade point average falls below 3.0 on a 4.0 scale a second time forfeits the scholarship for all subsequent semesters; (2) Complete fifteen credit hours of instruction per semester. The student shall enroll in and complete at least fifteen credit hours of instruction in each consecutive spring and fall term. Enroll in and complete at least thirty credit hours during each academic year. For purposes of this subdivision, an academic year consists of consecutive fall and spring terms.

The Board of regents may review and adjust the proficiency examinations administered in keeping with sound academic practice.
