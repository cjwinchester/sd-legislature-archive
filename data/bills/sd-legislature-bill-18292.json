Except for controlled access facilities as defined in \u00a7 31-8-1, interstate highways, unimproved section lines not commonly used as public rights-of-way, and highways within parks or recreation areas or within or adjoining public shooting areas or game refuges posted for restriction of an applicable use as hereinafter set forth by the Department of Game, Fish and Parks, \u00a7 41-9-1 does not apply to fishing, trapping, or hunting on highways or other public rights-of-way within this state that meet the requirements of \u00a7 41-9-1.3. No person, except the adjoining landowner or any person receiving written permission from the adjoining landowner, may use such highways or rights-of-way for the purposes of hunting defined in this title within six hundred sixty feet of an occupied dwelling, a church, schoolhouse, or livestock. The use of nontoxic shot is required for any hunting on such highways or rights-of-way. No person, except the adjoining landowner or any person receiving written permission from the adjoining landowner, may use such highways or rights-of-way for the purpose of trapping within six hundred sixty feet of an occupied dwelling, church, or schoolhouse. A violation of this section is a Class 2 misdemeanor. If any person is convicted of knowingly discharging a firearm within six hundred sixty feet of any occupied dwelling, church, or schoolhouse for which such distance has been clearly and accurately marked and posted, the court shall, in addition to any other penalty, revoke the person's hunting privileges for a period of one year from the date of conviction."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 18292, "action_date": "2003-02-04T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 96529, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/96529.pdf", "status_text": "First read in Senate and referred to", "journal_page": 307, "committee_id_action": 799, "committee_id_assigned": 772, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 18292, "action_date": "2003-02-11T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 96957, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/96957.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass,", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 772, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "F", "vote": {"vote_id": 56451, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [2847, 2881, 2886, 2887, 2891, 2851], "Excused": [2849], "Yea": [2928, 2852]}}, {"bill_id": 18292, "action_date": "2003-02-11T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 96957, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/96957.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to 41st legislative day", "journal_page": 420, "committee_id_action": 772, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 56452, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [2847, 2852], "Excused": [2849], "Yea": [2881, 2886, 2887, 2891, 2928, 2851]}}, {"bill_id": 18292, "action_date": "2003-02-11T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 96957, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/96957.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 772, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/18292"}
