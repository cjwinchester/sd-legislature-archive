BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That chapter 12-5 be amended by adding a NEW SECTION to read: Notwithstanding any other provision of title 12, each recognized political party in the Legislature may nominate one candidate for the United States Senate. Before the Legislature adjourns sine die, a candidate is required to receive a majority vote of the political party members of the candidate's party in each house of the Legislature to be nominated for the United States Senate. The vote for nomination of the candidate by each party shall be entered into the journal. If any member of the Legislature has changed the member's party affiliation since the last general election, that member may only vote for the political party nomination for which the member had designated at the last general election. If a political party does not have any party members in the Legislature, the state central committee of that political party may nominate one candidate for the Unites States Senate. No registered voter who has a designated party affiliation on January first of the year of the general election may file a nominating petition for the United States Senate. Any independent candidate who files a nominating petition that meets the requirements of chapter 12-7 may also have his or her name placed on the ballot for United States Senate. Section 2. That \u00a7 12-6-51.1 be amended to read: 12-6-51.1. If no candidate for United States Senate, United States House of Representatives, or Governor in a race involving three or more candidates receives thirty-five percent of the votes of the candidate's party, a runoff election shall be held ten weeks from the date of the first primary election. At the runoff election the only persons voted for shall be the two candidates receiving the highest number of votes at the first election. However, if there is a tie for second place in the first primary election and there is no tie for first place, all tying second place candidates shall be placed along with the first place candidate on the ballot for the runoff election. The runoff election shall be held at the same polling places, be conducted, returned, and canvassed and the results declared in the same manner as the first election. However, if the runoff election does not have a federal race, the electronic ballot marking system is not required, and hand-counted ballots may be used. The person receiving the highest number of votes at the runoff election is nominated as the candidate for the party."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 9147, "action_date": "2018-02-01T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 48515, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/48515.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 285, "committee_id_action": 396, "committee_id_assigned": 394, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 9147, "action_date": "2018-02-12T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 48905, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/48905.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 394, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 9147, "action_date": "2018-02-12T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 49060, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/49060.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to the 41st legislative day", "journal_page": 402, "committee_id_action": 394, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 25642, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [1424, 1425, 1226, 1277, 1299, 1240, 1215, 1229, 1265, 1257], "Nay": [1279, 1247], "Excused": [1306]}}]}
