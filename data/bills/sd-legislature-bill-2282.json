Section 2. That chapter 43-4 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: No residential real property that is adjacent to any lake may be transferred unless the property has been inspected by a certified installer of on-site wastewater systems who has been certified pursuant to ARSD chapter 74:53:02. The inspection shall be for any drainage, leakage, or runoff from any septic tank or septic tank system on the property into the lake that results in potential contamination of the lake. The seller shall pay the cost of the inspection. The results of the inspection shall be reported to the seller and the purchaser or prospective purchaser. For purposes of this section, the term, lake, means a pond, reservoir, or other body of water, created by either natural or artificial means, but not a pond or appurtenance that is used for the treatment and disposal of wastes and that is permitted for such uses.
