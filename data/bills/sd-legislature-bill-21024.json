WHEREAS, President George W. Bush established the Security and Prosperity Partnership (SPP) of North America, with the nations of Mexico and Canada on March 23, 2005; and WHEREAS, a television reporter asked President Bush on March 23, 2005, whether in light of the European Union the SPP was a step towards continental integration, and the President responded, \"...So that the vision that you asked about in your question as to what kind of union might there be, I see one based upon free trade, that would then entail commitment to markets and democracy, transparency, rule of law...,\"; and WHEREAS, the gradual creation of such a North American Union from a merger of the United States, Mexico, and Canada would be a direct threat to the Constitution and national independence of the United States, and would imply an eventual end to national borders within North America; and WHEREAS, a White House news release confirmed the continuing existence of the SPP and its \"ongoing process of cooperation\" on March 31, 2006; and WHEREAS, Congressman Ron Paul has written that a key to the SPP plan is an extensive new NAFTA superhighway that would stretch from Canada into Mexico, through the state of Texas; and WHEREAS, this trilateral partnership to develop a North American Union has never been presented to Congress as an agreement or treaty and has had virtually no congressional oversight; and WHEREAS, state and local governments throughout the United States would be negatively impacted by the SPP/North American Union process, such as the \"open borders\" vision of the SPP, eminent domain takings of private property along the planned superhighways, and increased law enforcement problems along those same superhighways: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the Senate of the Eighty-second Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the House of Representatives concurring therein, that the Congress of the United States, and particularly, the legislative delegation to Congress of the State of South Dakota, are hereby urged and petitioned to use all of their efforts, energies, and diligence to withdraw the United States from any further participation in the Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America and any other bilateral or multilateral activity however named that seeks to advance, authorize, fund, or in any way promote the creation of any structure to accomplish any form of North American Union as described in this resolution."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 21024, "action_date": "2007-02-23T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 112711, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/112711.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 906, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 21024, "action_date": "2007-02-23T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 112711, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/112711.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to 41st legislative day", "journal_page": 634, "committee_id_action": 906, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 65534, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [3571, 3608, 3612, 3634, 3641, 3647, 3602, 3585], "Excused": [3626]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/21024"}
