Any telecommunications company subject to the telecommunications gross receipts tax shall keep records of all receipts and telecommunications service sales. The records are, at all times during business hours of the day, subject to inspection by the department to determine the amount of tax due.

The dissolution of a corporation does not discharge an officer's liability for a prior failure of the corporation to make a return or remit the tax due. The sum due for such a liability may be assessed and collected as provided by law. If any responsible corporate officer elects not to be personally liable for the failure to file the required returns or to pay the tax due, the corporation shall provide the department with a surety bond or certificate of deposit as security for payment of any tax that may become due. The bond or certificate of deposit provided for in this section shall be in an amount equal to the estimated annual gross receipts multiplied by the applicable sales or gross receipts tax rate.
