No earned discharge credit may be awarded for partial months or for the first full calendar month of parole supervision in the community; (2) For each full calendar month of compliance with the penitentiary rules, an earned discharge credit of ten days shall be deducted from the inmate's sentence prior to the calculation of the initial parole date. No earned discharge credit may be awarded for partial months or for the first full calendar month of penitentiary incarceration; (3) A parolee is deemed to be compliant with the terms of supervision and shall be awarded earned discharge credits for the month if there was no violation of conditions of supervision during the month at the level warranting formal response per standardized department directive. A parolee may not receive earned discharge credits for the month if the parolee had a violation of conditions resulting in a formal response; (4) An inmate is deemed to be compliant for the month if there was no violation of penitentiary rules punishable by disciplinary segregation; (3)(5) No earned discharge credit may accrue for a calendar month in which a violation report has been submitted, the parolee has absconded from supervision, the parolee is under sanction of jailing or detainment, or for the months between the submission of the violation report and the final action on the violation report by the board. If the board does not find that the provisions of \u00a7 24-15A-27 or 24-15-20 have been violated, the board may include an award of earned discharge credits for the months the violation report was pending in the board's order to restore the parolee to the original or modified terms and conditions of parole; (4)(6) A parolee or inmate serving a sentence of life or death or a sentence for a conviction of a sex offense as defined in \u00a7 22-24B-1 or a violation of sex offender registry requirements or a violation of community safety zone requirements is not eligible for earned discharge credits under this section on any sentence of life or death or sex offense, sex offender registry violation, or community safety zone violation sentence; (5)(7) Earned discharge credits shall be applied to the sentence discharge date within thirty days of the end of the month in which the credits were earned. At least every six months, a parolee or inmate who is serving a sentence eligible for earned discharge credits shall be notified of the current sentence discharge date; and (6)(8) A parolee serving an eligible South Dakota prison sentence in any community in another state under the Interstate Compact for Adult Offender Supervision is eligible for earned discharge credits pursuant to this chapter. Section 2. That \u00a7 24-15A-51 be amended to read: 24-15A-51.

The board may also determine if the parolee or inmate is ineligible for the award of earned discharge credits. This review may be of the parolee's or inmate's record. A personal appearance of the parolee or inmate is not required. The decision of the board is final. Section 4. That chapter 24-15A be amended by adding a NEW SECTION to read: The department may grant an inmate up to ninety days of earned discharge credits for each program completion; up to ninety days of earned discharge credits upon completion of three hundred sixty hours of satisfactory work not to exceed one hundred eighty days of earned discharge credit for work in a twelve-month period; and up to three hundred sixty-five days of earned discharge credits for heroic acts in life threatening situations, through significant efforts in disaster response or by providing exceptional assistance in maintaining the safety and security of a prison.
