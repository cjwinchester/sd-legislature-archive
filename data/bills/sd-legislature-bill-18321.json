WHEREAS, all mandatory agricultural checkoff programs that require the producer to fund programs and activities were established to benefit the producer; and WHEREAS, under the present arrangement the boards administering the checkoff moneys are not accountable to producers and have frequently operated to promote the interests of the packers and retailers rather than the producers; and WHEREAS, a recent United States Department of Agriculture study of the beef checkoff indicated that from 1988 to 2002, the producers who paid the one dollar checkoff received 29% less of the consumer beef dollar, while retailers received 32% more of the consumer beef dollar and the packers 50% more; and WHEREAS, the producers have no effective input on how or where the checkoff dollars are spent; and WHEREAS, some checkoff boards have worked to effectively suppress the voices of producers; and WHEREAS, the United States Supreme Court in a 6-3 decision struck down a mushroom checkoff as a violation of the mushroom processors' first amendment right to free speech; and WHEREAS, beef, pork, and many other checkoffs are similar in structure to the mushroom checkoff; and WHEREAS, checkoff funds are being used to promote livestock feeding arrangements that are detrimental to independent producers: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the Senate of the Seventy-eighth Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the House of Representatives concurring therein, that the South Dakota Legislature supports court actions that will determine the constitutionality of checkoff programs; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Legislature advocates replacing these checkoffs with programs that incorporate the following: (1) A democratic system to elect the boards that administer the commodity checkoff dollars; (2) A mechanism to ensure that there is geographical balance among the checkoff boards; (3) A prohibition against bloc voting by any organization on behalf of its members who do not vote; (4) A system that allows producers to direct where their checkoff dollars are spent; and (5) A system that prohibits checkoff funds from being used to promote contract feeding; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that if the checkoff programs are not administered in a manner consistent with the provisions of this Resolution, the South Dakota Legislature advocates: (1) A provision whereby producers may opt out of the checkoff; (2) A regularly scheduled vote by producers to insure that the checkoff program still meets with the approval of producers; and (3) A system to easily refund checkoff dollars; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that checkoff program dollars are to be used for research, education, and promotion purposes."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 18321, "action_date": "2003-03-05T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 98430, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/98430.pdf", "status_text": "Adopt Resolution", "journal_page": 715, "committee_id_action": 799, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "F", "vote": {"vote_id": 55425, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [2832, 2834, 2835, 2838, 2840, 2847, 2849, 2851, 2852, 2853, 2854, 2856, 2865, 2868, 2876, 2878, 2882, 2887, 2891, 2897, 2901, 2904, 2908, 2921, 2926, 2927, 2928, 2935], "Yea": [2850, 2880, 2881, 2883, 2886, 2903, 2916]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/18321"}
