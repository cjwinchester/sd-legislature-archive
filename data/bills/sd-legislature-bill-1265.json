BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 13-6-82 be amended to read as follows: 13-6-82. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to authorize the transfer of the liabilities of existing bonded indebtedness from the district or territory against which it was originally incurred. Should If a school district dissolves and is annexed to another school district or school districts, and there be any is existing bonded indebtedness outstanding against a the dissolved district, the county auditor shall continue the annual tax levy that was provided for the redemption of such bond issue. The board of county commissioners shall have the same authority as a school board under the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 13-16-10 to 13-16-14, inclusive. The board of county commissioners shall direct the treasurer of the school board of the said former school district to transfer all money in the bond redemption fund as of the close of the last school fiscal year the district existed, to the county treasurer and the said county treasurer shall place such money so received in a trust fund along with the receipts from the annual tax levy provided in \u00a7 13-6-81 and shall be authorized to invest any surplus money in this trust fund in such securities as are authorized by law for school district funds and the income from such investments shall be added to such trust fund. The county treasurer shall apply the money in the said trust fund to the redemption of such bonded indebtedness as the bonds become due and payable and, if sufficient money is available, may negotiate with the bondholders to purchase outstanding bonds ahead of schedule when such action is deemed advisable and so ordered by the board of county commissioners. When the bonds are paid and canceled, the county treasurer shall place the unused balance in the said trust fund, if any, to the credit of the district or districts containing territory of the former school district. If two or more school districts consolidate, and there is existing bonded indebtedness outstanding against any of the former school districts, the county auditor shall continue the annual tax levy that was provided for the redemption of the bonds. The board of county commissioners may assume the authority for the redemption of the bonds and proceed as it would if the former district had dissolved, or it may transfer that authority to the new school district which includes territory of the former school district."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 1265, "action_date": "2009-02-03T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 6759, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/6759.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 268, "committee_id_action": 56, "committee_id_assigned": 43, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 1265, "action_date": "2009-02-09T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 6836, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/6836.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 43, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 1265, "action_date": "2009-02-09T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 6996, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/6996.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass", "journal_page": 309, "committee_id_action": 43, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 3731, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [720, 688, 708, 712, 724, 652, 714, 736, 728, 658, 723, 684, 696], "Excused": [729, 678]}}, {"bill_id": 1265, "action_date": "2009-02-10T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 7159, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/7159.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to another day", "journal_page": 332, "committee_id_action": 56, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 1265, "action_date": "2009-02-11T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 7246, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/7246.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass", "journal_page": 349, "committee_id_action": 56, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 3935, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [716, 720, 666, 688, 676, 670, 726, 715, 699, 635, 692, 651, 643, 712, 709, 660, 706, 725, 693, 644, 724, 727, 721, 652, 737, 672, 698, 717, 738, 654, 711, 719, 683, 695, 696, 722, 645, 637, 665, 687, 678, 650, 646, 668, 639, 735, 679, 734, 714, 731, 736, 713, 710, 728, 657, 641, 658, 647, 691, 723, 718, 684, 733, 732, 707, 681], "Excused": [674, 708, 730, 729]}}, {"bill_id": 1265, "action_date": "2009-02-12T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 7359, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/7359.pdf", "status_text": "First read in Senate and referred to", "journal_page": 389, "committee_id_action": 54, "committee_id_assigned": 32, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 1265, "action_date": "2009-02-19T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 7527, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/7527.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 32, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 1265, "action_date": "2009-02-24T08:30:00-06:00", "document_id": 7829, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/7829.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 32, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 1265, "action_date": "2009-02-24T08:30:00-06:00", "document_id": 8088, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/8088.pdf", "status_text": "Tabled", "journal_page": 521, "committee_id_action": 32, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 4579, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [677, 656, 661, 664, 648, 640, 673]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/1265"}
