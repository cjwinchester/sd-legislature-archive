BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That chapter 41-6 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: The Game, Fish and Parks Commission shall promulgate rules pursuant to chapter 1-26 to establish a program for the issuance of landowner-sponsored big game hunting licenses to persons designated by the owners or lessees of land located in South Dakota. Under the program any resident landowner or lessee who owns or leases at least three hundred twenty acres of agricultural, grazing, or timber land in South Dakota may sponsor resident or nonresident applicants for landowner-sponsored big game hunting licenses, as provided in this Act, in addition to any big game license to which the landowner or lessee would otherwise be entitled. Each landowner-sponsored applicant shall be issued landowner-sponsored licenses at the same cost as a corresponding landowner license. The landowner-sponsored licenses may only be used on the landowner's or lessee's property. At least one landowner-sponsored license may be issued for each qualifying property. Additional landowner-sponsored licenses may be issued upon the recommendation of the conservation officer for that area, not to exceed six landowner-sponsored licenses for a qualifying property. Any landowner or lessee who sponsors an applicant under this Act shall allow public access hunting for at least the second half of the big game season to a number of hunters equal to the number of sponsored licenses provided for the property. The landowner or lessee shall register any such public access hunters with the Department of Game, Fish and Parks. Such public access hunting may be restricted to antlerless game. Section 2. The provisions of this Act are repealed on July 1, 2013."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 1483, "action_date": "2010-01-14T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 10501, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/10501.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 48, "committee_id_action": 86, "committee_id_assigned": 87, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 1483, "action_date": "2010-01-28T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 11005, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/11005.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 87, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 1483, "action_date": "2010-01-28T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 11347, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/11347.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 87, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "F", "vote": {"vote_id": 5821, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [831, 832, 843, 841, 833, 746, 828], "Yea": [811, 792, 836, 838, 789, 793]}}, {"bill_id": 1483, "action_date": "2010-01-28T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 11347, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/11347.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to the 41st legislative day", "journal_page": 213, "committee_id_action": 87, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 5823, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [831, 832, 843, 841, 833, 746, 828], "Nay": [811, 792, 836, 838, 789, 793]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/1483"}
