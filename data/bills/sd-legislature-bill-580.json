A violation of this section may constitute grounds for discipline against a real estate appraiser who is registered, licensed, or certified pursuant to the laws of the State of South Dakota. Section 2. That chapter 36-21B be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: No person violates section 1 of this Act solely by asking a real estate appraiser to consider additional, appropriate property information, or to provide further detail, substantiation, or explanation for the appraiser's value conclusion, or to correct errors in the appraisal report, or by withholding payment of an appraisal fee based on a bona fide dispute regarding the appraiser's compliance with the appraisal standards adopted by the Department of Revenue and Regulation pursuant to this chapter. A person does not violate section 1 of this Act solely by retaining a real estate appraiser from panels or lists on a rotating basis, or by supplying an appraiser with information the appraiser is required to analyze under the appraisal standards adopted by the department, such as agreements of sale, options, or listings of the property to be valued. Section 3. That chapter 54-14 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: No mortgage lender, mortgage broker, or mortgage loan originator, required to be licensed or registered by this chapter, with an interest in a real estate transaction or the financing of any loan secured by real estate involving an appraisal assignment may improperly influence or attempt to improperly influence the development, reporting, result, or review of a real estate appraisal by: (1) Coercion, extortion, or bribery; (2) Withholding or threatened withholding of payment for an appraisal fee; (3) Conditioning of the payment of an appraisal fee upon the opinion, conclusion, or valuation to be reached; (4) Requesting that the appraiser report a predetermined opinion, conclusion, or valuation or the desired valuation of any person; or (5) Any other act or practice that impairs or attempts to impair an appraiser's independence, objectivity, and impartiality.
