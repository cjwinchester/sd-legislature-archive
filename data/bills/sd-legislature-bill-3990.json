BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 61-6-39 be amended to read as follows: 61-6-39. Any individual who has willfully or fraudulently misrepresented any fact to secure or increase benefits under this title shall be denied benefits for not less than one week and not to exceed fifty-two weeks of otherwise compensable unemployment, as defined in this chapter from and after the date such misrepresentation or fraudulent act is discovered in accordance with rules promulgated by the department pursuant to chapter 1-26. In addition to any penalty imposed under this title, the department shall impose a penalty equal to fifty percent of the amount of benefits obtained by willful or fraudulent misrepresentation for the first offense and a penalty equal to one hundred percent of the amount of benefits for each subsequent offense. Any penalty collected shall be paid into the unemployment trust fund. Section 2. That \u00a7 61-5-39 be amended to read as follows: 61-5-39. Each employer's experience-rating account shall be charged with all benefits chargeable, as provided in this title, except extended benefits paid as provided in \u00a7\u00a7 61-6-49 to 61-6-66, inclusive, against wages paid for employment by the employer. However, no benefits paid on the basis of a period of employment may be charged to the experience-rating account of any employer, except as provided in \u00a7 61-5-41, if the claimant: (1) Voluntarily separated without good cause attributable to the employer or the employment; (2) Was discharged or suspended for misconduct connected with the employment, or for conduct mandated by religious belief which belief cannot be reasonably accommodated by the employer; (3) Was discharged or suspended for inability or incompetence to successfully complete a ninety-day probationary period established between the employer and employee at the time of employment; (4) Earned total base period wages of less than one hundred dollars with one employer; (5) Is receiving benefits while in approved training authorized by \u00a7 61-6-21; (6) Performed services while incarcerated in a custodial or penal institution and terminated such employment because of his transfer or release from the institution; (7) Received benefits for unemployment directly caused by a major natural disaster declared by the president pursuant to section 410(a) of the Robert T.
