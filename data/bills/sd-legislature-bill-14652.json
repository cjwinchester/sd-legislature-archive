BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. Terms used in this Act mean: (1) \"Livestock,\" live cattle, swine, or sheep; (2) \"Packer,\" a person who is engaged in the business of slaughtering livestock or receiving, purchasing, or soliciting livestock for slaughtering, the meat products of which are directly or indirectly to be offered for resale or for public consumption. Packer includes an agent of the packer engaged in buying or soliciting livestock for slaughter on behalf of a packer. Packer does not include a cold storage plant or frozen food locker plant. Section 2. A packer purchasing or soliciting livestock for slaughter in this state may not discriminate in prices paid or offered to be paid to sellers of that livestock. This section does not apply to the sale and purchase of livestock if the following requirements are met: (1) The price differential is based on the quality of the livestock, if the packer purchases or solicits the livestock based upon a payment method specifying prices paid for criteria relating to carcass merit; actual and quantifiable costs related to transporting and acquiring the livestock by the packer; or an agreement for the delivery of livestock at a specified date or time; and (2) After making a differential payment to a seller, the packer publishes information relating to the differential pricing, including the payment method for carcass merit, transportation and acquisition pricing, and an offer to enter into an agreement for the delivery of livestock at a specified date or time according to the same terms and conditions offered to other sellers. Section 3. A packer shall provide all sellers with the same terms and conditions offered to a seller who receives a differential price based on any of the criteria described in section 2 of this Act. Section 4. A packer shall, at the end of each day during which livestock are purchased or contracted, provide to the United States Department of Agriculture, agricultural market service livestock market news branch, and the South Dakota Department of Agriculture, all prices paid for livestock, both contract and direct purchased, that day. Section 5. Any agreement made by a packer in violation of this Act is voidable. Any packer acting in violation of this section is guilty of a fraudulent practice. Section 6. The attorney general shall enforce the provisions of this Act and the Department of Agriculture shall refer any violations of these provisions to the attorney general. The attorney general or any person injured by a violation of these provisions may bring an action in circuit court to restrain a packer from violating these provisions. A seller who receives a discriminatory price or who is offered only a discriminatory price for livestock based upon a violation of these provisions by a packer has a civil cause of action against the packer and, if successful, shall be awarded treble damages. Section 7. Any packer shall make available for publication and to the Department of Agriculture, a daily report setting forth information regarding prices paid for livestock, under each contract in force, in which the packer and a South Dakota resident are parties for the purchase of the livestock by the packer, and which sets a date for delivery more than twenty days after the making of the contract. The reports shall be completed on forms prepared by the department for comparison with cash market prices for livestock according to procedures required by the department in rules promulgated pursuant to chapter 1-26. The report may not include information regarding the identity of a seller. A failure of a packer to report as required by this section is punishable by a civil penalty not to exceed ten percent of the packer's gross purchases within the period of violation. The department shall refer to the attorney general any packer or packer's agent who the department believes is in violation of the provisions of this Act. The attorney general may, upon referral from the department, file an action in circuit court to enforce these provisions. Section 8. This Act shall take effect when the legislatures of the states of Minnesota, Iowa, Wyoming, and Nebraska have enacted substantially similar legislation. The attorney general of South Dakota may be notified by any South Dakota citizen of said enactments and within thirty days shall substantiate the legislative enactments and enforce the provisions of this Act. Section 9. In the event the provisions of section 8 are not fulfilled, the Senate engrossed version of Senate Bill 95 is hereby repealed.

BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. The Legislature finds that the enforcement of the federal Packers and Stockyards Act is inadequate and that this trend has intensified in recent years. The failure to enforce the federal Packers and Stockyards Act has resulted in the vast majority of beef in the United States being concentrated in the hands of a small number of packing firms and has restricted fair competition for livestock producers. The only recourse for the State of South Dakota is to enact appropriate provisions for the regulation of packers as provided in section 2 of this Act to protect South Dakota citizens who are directly or indirectly associated with the state's agricultural economy. Section 2. No packer, with respect to livestock, meats, meat food products, or livestock products in unmanufactured form, and no live poultry dealer with respect to live poultry, may: (1) Engage in or use any unfair, unjustly discriminatory, or deceptive practice or device; (2) Make or give any undue or unreasonable preference or advantage to any particular person or locality in any respect whatsoever, or subject any particular person or locality to any undue or unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage in any respect whatsoever; (3) Sell or otherwise transfer to or for any other packer or any live poultry dealer, or buy or otherwise receive from or for any other packer or any live poultry dealer, any article for the purpose or with the effect of apportioning the supply between any such persons, if the apportionment has the tendency or effect of restraining commerce or of creating a monopoly; (4) Sell or otherwise transfer to or for any other person, or buy or otherwise receive from or for any other person, any article for the purpose or with the effect of manipulating or controlling prices, or of creating a monopoly in the acquisition of, buying, selling, or dealing in, any article, or of restraining commerce; (5) Engage in any course of business or do any act for the purpose or with the effect of manipulating or controlling prices, or of creating a monopoly in the acquisition of, buying, selling, or dealing in, any article, or of restraining commerce; (6) Conspire, combine, agree, or arrange with any other person to apportion territory for carrying on business, or to apportion purchases or sales of any article, or to manipulate or control prices; or (7) Conspire, combine, agree, or arrange with any other person to do, or aid and abet the doing of, any act made unlawful by subdivisions (1) to (5), inclusive, of this section.
