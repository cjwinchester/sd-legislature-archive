WHEREAS, the Cheyenne River, White River, and Bad River watersheds cover large portions of western South Dakota, and the Niobrara River watershed covers a large portion of central and western Nebraska; and WHEREAS, erosion from throughout these watersheds has brought millions of metric tons of sediment into the Missouri River reservoir system; and WHEREAS, overt the past forty years, the sediment from the Bad River has caused the bed of the Missouri River to rise significantly, most notably in the Pierre-Fort Pierre area; and WHEREAS, this long-standing problem has resulted in significant problems for residents of these communities as they struggle with both groundwater and overland flooding in low-lying areas; and WHEREAS, in 1997, Congress saw fit to authorize a flood mitigation project within the two communities to assist residents living in the affected areas of Pierre and Fort Pierre; and WHEREAS, Congress has appropriated nearly $30 million over the past six years and has directed the United States Army Corps of Engineers to oversee the implementation of this project; and WHEREAS, the scope of the project increased significantly upon implementation of the authorization legislation by the United States Army Corps of Engineers; and WHEREAS, new authorization legislation may be needed to finish the project in an appropriate fashion; and WHEREAS, numerous other communities adjacent to the Missouri River are seeing the dramatic effects of sedimentation on wildlife, tourism, and hydroelectric generation potential; and WHEREAS, if left unchecked, the continued increase in sedimentation will cause vast stretches of the Missouri River to be changed forever; and WHEREAS, this will have both an environmental and economic impact not only on those communities adjoining the Missouri River, but the entire State of South Dakota: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the Senate of the Seventy-eighth Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the House of Representatives concurring therein, that the Legislature requests the United States Congress to approve authorization legislation that would complete the intent of the 1997 Pierre-Fort Pierre Flood Mitigation Act; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Seventy-eighth Legislature of the State of South Dakota asks Congress to implement a long-term strategy to deal with the increasingly serious problem of sedimentation and the negative effects felt by people and communities along the Missouri River."}, {"bill_id": 18328, "bill_version_id": 98373, "bill_version": "Enrolled", "bill_version_date": "2003-03-05T08:48:17-06:00", "bill_text": ""}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 18328, "action_date": "2003-02-28T13:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 98160, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/98160.pdf", "status_text": "Adopt Resolution", "journal_page": 642, "committee_id_action": 799, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 55249, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [2832, 2834, 2838, 2840, 2847, 2849, 2850, 2851, 2852, 2853, 2854, 2856, 2865, 2868, 2876, 2878, 2880, 2881, 2882, 2883, 2886, 2887, 2891, 2897, 2901, 2903, 2904, 2908, 2916, 2921, 2926, 2927, 2928, 2935], "Excused": [2835]}}, {"bill_id": 18328, "action_date": "2003-03-04T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 98345, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/98345.pdf", "status_text": "Concur In resolution", "journal_page": 717, "committee_id_action": 798, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 56842, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [2833, 2836, 2837, 2841, 2842, 2843, 2844, 2845, 2846, 2848, 2855, 2858, 2859, 2860, 2861, 2862, 2863, 2864, 2866, 2869, 2870, 2871, 2872, 2873, 2874, 2875, 2877, 2879, 2884, 2885, 2888, 2889, 2890, 2892, 2893, 2894, 2895, 2896, 2898, 2900, 2902, 2905, 2906, 2907, 2909, 2910, 2911, 2912, 2913, 2914, 2915, 2917, 2919, 2920, 2922, 2923, 2924, 2925, 2930, 2931, 2932, 2933, 2936, 2937, 2938, 2899], "Excused": [2839, 2857, 2929], "Nay": [2934]}}]}
