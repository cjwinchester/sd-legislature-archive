No cause of action for any person may arise against a licensee acting as a buyer's or tenant's agent for making any required or permitted disclosure. A buyer's agent does not terminate the buyer's agency relationship by making any required or permitted disclosures. Section 15. That chapter 36-21A be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: No licensee acting as a buyer's or tenant's agent owes any fiduciary duty or obligation to a customer. A licensee shall provide disclosure of all adverse material facts known by the licensee to any customer. No buyer's or tenant's agent owes any duty to conduct an independent investigation of the client's financial condition. Section 16. That chapter 36-21A be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: A buyer's or tenant's agent may show properties in which the client is interested to other prospective buyers or tenants without breaching any duty or obligation to the client.

Section 19. That chapter 36-21A be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Without the express written authority of a client, no limited agent may disclose to one client any confidential information about the other client unless the disclosure is required by statute or rule or failure to disclose the information would constitute misrepresentation. No cause of action for any person may arise against a limited agent for making any required or permitted disclosure.

Section 24. That chapter 36-21A be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Every responsible broker shall develop and maintain a written office policy that specifically sets forth agency and brokerage relationships that the broker may establish. At the first substantive contact with a seller or buyer who has not entered into a written agreement with a broker, the licensee shall: (1) Disclose in writing to that person the types of agency and brokerage relationships the broker is offering to that person; and (2) Provide that person with a written copy of a disclosure on a form prescribed by the commission. The written disclosure shall contain a signature block for the client or customer to acknowledge receipt of the disclosure. The customer's acknowledgment of disclosure does not constitute a contract with the licensee. If the customer fails or refuses to sign the disclosure, the licensee shall note that fact on a copy of the disclosure and retain the copy. After a seller and buyer have entered into a written agency or brokerage agreement with a broker, no other licensee is required to make the disclosures required by this section. The commission may prescribe the disclosure form by rules promulgated pursuant to chapter 1-26. Section 25. That chapter 36-21A be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: No client or customer is liable for any misrepresentation made by the licensee arising out of their agency or brokerage agreement unless the client or customer knew of the misrepresentation. No licensee is liable for a misrepresentation of the licensee's client arising out of the agency agreement unless the licensee knew of the misrepresentation. In any agency or brokerage relationship, the licensees, each client or customer, and the real estate brokerage are required to possess only actual knowledge and information. There is no imputation of knowledge or information by operation of law among or between the clients or customers, the real estate brokerage, and its licensees. Section 26. That chapter 36-21A be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: This Act supersedes only the duties of the parties under the common law, including fiduciary duties of an agent to a principal, to the extent inconsistent with this chapter. The common law continues to apply to the parties in all other respects. This chapter does not affect the duties of any licensee while engaging in the authorized or unauthorized practice of law as determined by the courts of this state. Section 27. That chapter 36-21A be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Unless otherwise provided in the agreement or by law, no broker and licensee associated with that broker engaged as a seller's/landlord's or buyer's/tenant's agent, subagent, limited agent, or transaction broker owes any further duty or obligation to a client or customer after termination, expiration, completion, or performance of the agency or brokerage agreement, except for the following duties: (1) Accounting for all moneys and property related to and received during the engagement; and (2) Keeping confidential all information received during the course of the engagement. Section 28. That \u00a7 36-21A-73 be repealed. 36-21A-73. No licensee may advertise, place a sign upon any property offering it for sale or lease, or show property to prospective customers unless a broker holds a currently effective listing or management agreement signed by the owner to act on the owner's behalf as to the property. Every listing agreement shall be in writing and shall contain the proper legal description, the price and terms, the expiration date, the type of agency relationship established, the compensation, the signatures of all parties, and it shall be endorsed by the broker taking the listing. At the same time of securing the listing, the licensee who obtains the listing shall give the person signing a copy of the listing agreement. A listing may not include a provision for automatic renewal of the listing at expiration. If a broker represents a buyer of real estate, the broker shall obtain written authorization from the buyer to act on his behalf to advertise for or show real estate to the buyer. Every written authorization shall contain a description of the type and geographical area of property sought by the buyer, the type of agency relationship established, the compensation to be paid, a definite expiration date, the signatures of the buyer and the broker, and the date of authorization. When taking a listing, a broker shall provide, in a separate agreement, a clear and complete explanation of how the broker will represent the interests of the seller or buyer. If the broker represents both the seller and the buyer in a given transaction, the agreement shall state how that representation would be altered in a dual agency situation, and require the seller or buyer to choose whether to authorize the broker to initiate any transaction which would give rise to dual agency. Section 29. That \u00a7 36-21A-85 be repealed. 36-21A-85. In all real estate transactions, a licensee under this chapter is the agent of the owner/seller unless all parties otherwise agree in writing. Any agency relationship shall be disclosed in writing to a party not being represented before showing any property. The commission may promulgate rules pursuant to chapter 1-26 for mandatory uniform disclosure provisions under this section. Licensees in the same firm, partnership, corporation, association or group under this chapter may not represent more than one party to a transaction without the written consent of all parties to the transaction.
