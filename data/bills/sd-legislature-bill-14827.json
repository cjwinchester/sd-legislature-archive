Section 19. If the director and secretary find that the requirements of any private accrediting body meet the requirements of network adequacy, quality assurance, or quality improvement as set forth in this Act, the carrier may, at the discretion of the director and secretary, be deemed to have met the applicable requirements.

The registration shall be subject to the provisions of \u00a7 \u00a7 58-18-71 to 58-18-75, inclusive, and any applicable rules promulgated pursuant to those sections. Section 16. A health carrier that provides managed care plans shall develop and maintain the infrastructure and disclosure systems necessary to measure the quality of health care services provided to covered persons on a regular basis and appropriate to the types of plans offered by the health carrier. A health carrier shall: (1) Utilize a system designed to assess the quality of health care provided to covered persons and appropriate to the types of plans offered by the health carrier. The system shall include systematic collection, analysis, and reporting of relevant data in accordance with statutory and regulatory requirements. The level of quality assessment activities undertaken by a health plan may vary based on the plan's structure with the least amount of quality assessment activities required being those plans which are open and the provider network is simply a discounted fee for service preferred provider organization; (2) File a written description of the quality assessment program with the director in the prescribed general format, which shall include a signed certification by a corporate officer of the health carrier that the filing meets the requirements of this Act.

A health carrier that issues a closed plan, or a combination plan having a closed component, shall, in addition to complying with the requirements of section 16 of this Act, develop and maintain the internal structures and activities necessary to improve the quality of care being provided. Quality improvement activities for a health carrier subject to the requirements of this section should, at a minimum, involve: (1) Developing a written quality improvement plan designed to analyze both the processes and outcomes of the health care delivered to covered persons; (2) Establishing an internal system to implement the quality improvement plan and to specifically identify opportunities to improve care and using the findings of the system to improve the health care delivered to covered persons; and (3) Assuring that participating providers have the opportunity to participate in developing, implementing, and evaluating the quality improvement system. The health carrier shall provide a copy of the quality improvement plan to the director or secretary, if requested. Section 18. Nothing in this Act applies to health carrier's plans that do not contain provider networks or to dental only, vision only, accident only, school accident, travel, or specified disease plans or plans that primarily provide a fixed daily, fixed occurrence, or fixed per procedure benefit without regard to expenses incurred. Section 19. If the director and secretary find that the requirements of any private accrediting body meet the requirements of network adequacy, quality assurance, or quality improvement as set forth in this Act, the carrier may, at the discretion of the director and secretary, be deemed to have met the applicable requirements. Section 20. That \u00a7 58-41-12 be amended to read as follows: 58-41-12. Upon receipt of an application for issuance of a certificate of authority, the director shall forthwith transmit copies of such application and accompanying documents to the secretary. The secretary shall determine whether the applicant for a certificate of authority has: (1) Demonstrated the willingness and potential ability to assure that health care services will be provided in a manner to assure both the availability and accessibility of adequate personnel and facilities and in a manner enhancing availability, accessibility and continuity of service consistent with the requirements of this Act ; (2) Arrangements, established in accordance with regulations promulgated by the secretary for an ongoing quality of health care assurance program consistent with the requirements of this Act concerning health care processes and outcomes; (3) A procedure, established in accordance with regulations promulgated by the secretary, to develop, compile, evaluate, and report statistics relating to the cost of its operations, the pattern of utilization of its services, the availability and accessibility of its services, and such other matters as may be reasonably required by the secretary; and (4) Reasonable provisions for emergency and out-of-area health care services. Section 21. That \u00a7 58-41-53 be repealed. 58-41-53. No health maintenance organization or representative may allow providers under agreement with a health maintenance organization to have recourse against enrollees for amounts above those specified in the evidence of coverage as the periodic prepayment, or copayment, for health care services. Violation of this section is a Class 2 misdemeanor. Section 22. Nothing in this Act applies to health carriers that only offer individual policies if: (1) The policy does not use an individual or group to determine where or when services will be rendered, the course of treatment, or who will provide the services; (2) The policy does not require pre-authorization for services provided under the policy; and (3) The difference in policy benefits does not exceed ten percent whether an insured used a participating provider or nonparticipating provider. Section 23. The Division of Insurance shall separately monitor complaints regarding managed care for any policy that is exempt pursuant to section 22 of this Act.
