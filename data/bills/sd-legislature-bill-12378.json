and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the committee solicit information and assistance from executive branch agencies to determine areas in which the states can collaborate to deliver governmental services more efficiently and cost-effectively; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the committee request reports annually from executive branch agencies regarding efforts to cooperate with agencies of North Dakota government; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Executive Board of Legislative Research Council report its findings and recommendations, together with any proposed legislation necessary to implement the recommendations, to the 1998 Legislature."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 12378, "action_date": "1997-01-22T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 72194, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/72194.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 539, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 12378, "action_date": "1997-01-24T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 72212, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/72212.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 539, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 12378, "action_date": "1997-01-24T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 72212, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/72212.pdf", "status_text": "Adopt Resolution", "journal_page": 109, "committee_id_action": 539, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 35851, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [1890, 1900, 1904, 1924, 1931, 1936, 1967, 1940, 1949, 1970, 1961], "Excused": [1926, 1921]}}, {"bill_id": 12378, "action_date": "1997-01-24T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 72212, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/72212.pdf", "status_text": "Place on Consent Calendar", "journal_page": 109, "committee_id_action": 539, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 12378, "action_date": "1997-01-27T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 72884, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/72884.pdf", "status_text": "Adopt Resolution", "journal_page": 155, "committee_id_action": 544, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 36125, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [1886, 1887, 1888, 1890, 1891, 1892, 1894, 1895, 1896, 1897, 1898, 1899, 1902, 1903, 1904, 1906, 1907, 1909, 1910, 1913, 1914, 1916, 1917, 1918, 1921, 1922, 1923, 1926, 1929, 1931, 1933, 1934, 1937, 1940, 1941, 1942, 1943, 1944, 1948, 1950, 1952, 1953, 1954, 1957, 1958, 1961, 1962, 1963, 1964, 1966, 1967, 1968, 1970, 1971, 1973, 1974, 1975, 1980, 1982, 1983, 1984, 1985, 1987, 1988, 1924], "Absent": [1900, 1936, 1947, 1949], "Nay": [1951]}}, {"bill_id": 12378, "action_date": "1997-02-07T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 72309, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/72309.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 527, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 12378, "action_date": "1997-02-10T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 72316, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/72316.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 527, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 12378, "action_date": "1997-02-10T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 72316, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/72316.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to 41st legislative day", "journal_page": 368, "committee_id_action": 527, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 36640, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [1911, 1915, 1956, 1912, 1930, 1946, 1986, 1969, 1927]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/12378"}
