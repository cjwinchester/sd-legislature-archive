WHEREAS, the federal Livestock Mandatory Price Reporting Act of 1999 established price reporting requirements for livestock packers and other entities in an effort to promote equity and fair competition in the livestock packing industry; and WHEREAS, the federal Livestock Mandatory Price Reporting Act has the potential to lead to improvements in the openness and fairness of operations in the livestock and packing industries. However, certain practices used in the implementation of the Act must be adjusted in order to ensure proper disclosure of information in accordance with the original intent of the Act; and WHEREAS, the \"3/60\" price reporting guideline suspends the reporting requirements if there were fewer than three actively participating entities in the market during the reporting period or if any participant controlled more than sixty percent of the market during the reporting period, a practice that in many situations serves to prevent the reporting of information that the framers of the Act likely intended to be subject to the reporting requirements; and WHEREAS, the 3/60 rule was not included in the Mandatory Price Reporting Act nor in proposed regulations, but was incorporated at the request of the Office of Management and Budget without the opportunity for comment or input by producers and the public; and WHEREAS, the problems resulting from the 3/60 rule demonstrate the degree of concentration within the livestock and meat industries; and WHEREAS, although the Mandatory Price Reporting Act and final regulations encourage voluntary reporting by packers that are not required to report under the mandatory guidelines and procedures, there is currently an effort to abandon the voluntary reporting program; and WHEREAS, information that is not required to be reported under the 3/60 rule is currently being reported under the voluntary reporting system, and smaller packers not under the mandatory guidelines are encouraged to report under the voluntary program; and WHEREAS, because the legislative intent of the Mandatory Price Reporting Act was to provide more, not less, information, the repeal of the 3/60 rule and the continuation of the voluntary reporting system are necessary in order to achieve the original purposes of the Act: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the House of Representatives of the Seventy- sixth Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the Senate concurring therein, that the South Dakota Legislature urges the federal Administration and the Congress to ensure proper enforcement of the Livestock Mandatory Price Reporting Act of 1999 by the United States Department of Agriculture, including a continuation of the voluntary reporting program to allow small packers and producers to report their prices and a repeal of the 3/60 mandatory price reporting rule."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 16664, "action_date": "2001-02-26T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 90883, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/90883.pdf", "status_text": "Adopt Resolution", "journal_page": 722, "committee_id_action": 712, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "F", "vote": {"vote_id": 51688, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [2514, 2515, 2522, 2525, 2526, 2528, 2533, 2537, 2538, 2544, 2546, 2553, 2556, 2557, 2559, 2561, 2563, 2564, 2565, 2570, 2571, 2572, 2575, 2577, 2578, 2579, 2582, 2588, 2592, 2593, 2595, 2596, 2600, 2601, 2604, 2610, 2612, 2613, 2618, 2540], "Yea": [2518, 2519, 2521, 2527, 2530, 2541, 2543, 2545, 2547, 2548, 2554, 2555, 2558, 2560, 2566, 2568, 2574, 2583, 2586, 2587, 2589, 2591, 2594, 2599, 2602, 2603, 2605, 2611, 2614], "Excused": [2608]}}]}
