WHEREAS, Americans enjoy the safest and most abundant food supply in the world, which reflects the tremendous productivity and efficiency of our agricultural economy and our farming and ranching community; and WHEREAS, it is of the utmost importance to the people of the United States to maintain the safety and reliability of our food supply and to safeguard our food supply from contamination from whatever source; and WHEREAS, according to the United States Department of Agriculture, the United States lost over $2.6 billion in exports during 2003 and 2004 as a result of restrictions and bans on the importation of U.S. beef because of the possibility of meat tainted with bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) from Canadian livestock; and WHEREAS, a new case of BSE was just confirmed in Alberta, Canada, once again threatening U.S. beef exports to all trading partners, especially Japan. Japan is the world's second largest beef importer and intends to reinstate its ban on the importation of U.S. beef because of fears of BSE; and WHEREAS, the integrity of our food supply and economic health of our country is being threatened once again. We cannot afford another recession in our industry caused by something that is preventable while leaders of agriculture in our state are calling for the closure of our border to Canadian beef imports; and WHEREAS, the agricultural sector of the American economy is capable of providing a safe and sufficient food supply to meet the needs of the American people and to avoid sources of food-borne illnesses; and WHEREAS, the United States Department of Agriculture has yet to confirm the exact epidemiology of the strain of the BSE case discovered in the U.S.; and WHEREAS, the United States Congress has acted to close the Canadian border in the past to preserve the integrity of the U.S. food supply and beef industry, an action that was implemented without severe economic impact: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the Senate of the Eighty-first Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the House of Representatives concurring therein, that the South Dakota Legislature supports a moratorium on all imports of live cattle, beef, precooked beef, and all beef products until more science is developed or science can prove that the cattle and beef are free of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) for the purpose of safeguarding the American consumer and the United States live cattle industry."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 20827, "action_date": "2006-02-21T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 109065, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/109065.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 867, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 20827, "action_date": "2006-02-21T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 109065, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/109065.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to 36th legislative day", "journal_page": 590, "committee_id_action": 867, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 62986, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [3374, 3396, 3416, 3421, 3425, 3439, 3415, 3376], "Nay": [3411]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/20827"}
