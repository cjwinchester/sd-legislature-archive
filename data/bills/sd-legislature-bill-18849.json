Section 3. Any incentive that discounts the end retail price below cost to consumers at the time of purchase of the motor vehicle fuel is prohibited. Section 4. No retailer dealer may sell motor vehicle fuel below cost if the motor vehicle fuel offered for sale by the way of posted price or indicating meter at a retail location is dispensed into any passenger automobile and truck by either a customer or a retail dealer attendant. Section 5. Any offer for sale of motor vehicle fuel by a retail dealer or retail location by the way of posted price or indicating meter that is below cost as defined in subdivision (1) of section 2 of this Act is a violation of this Act. The secretary of the Department of Revenue and Regulation shall assess a civil penalty equal to three times the value of the motor vehicle fuel sold for each day or part of the day that the posted price was below cost.
