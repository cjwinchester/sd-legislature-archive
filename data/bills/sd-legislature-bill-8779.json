The term does not include the shifting of personnel costs or similar short-term cost savings that cannot be definitively measured; (8)(13) \"Qualified energy service provider\" or \"provider,\" a person, business, or state agency with experience in the design, implementation, or installation of cost saving measures, who can demonstrate the financial capabilities of completing the obligations stipulated to in an energy performance contract; (9)(14) \"Utility cost savings,\" expenses for utilities that are eliminated or avoided on a long-term basis as a result of equipment installed or modified, or services performed by a qualified energy service provider. The term includes expenses for natural gas, propane or similar fuels, electricity, water, waste water, and waste disposal. Section 2. That \u00a7 1-33B-3.1 be amended to read: 1-33B-3.1. For the purposes of this chapter, the term, guaranteed cost savings, means a guaranteed annual measurable monetary reduction in utility, operating, and maintenance costs for each year of a guarantee period as a result of cost-saving measures. Guaranteed The guaranteed cost savings for utility savings shall be calculated using the mutually agreed upon baseline utility rates in use at the time of an investment-grade energy audit. Guaranteed The guaranteed cost savings for operation and maintenance cost savings shall be calculated using mutually agreed upon baseline operation and maintenance costs at the time of an investment-grade energy audit. Section 3. That \u00a7 1-33B-3.2 be amended to read: 1-33B-3.2. For the purposes of this chapter, the term, investment-grade energy audit, means a study of energy or water usage of a public building, including a detailed description of the improvements recommended for the project, the estimated cost of the improvements, and the utility, operation, and maintenance cost savings projected to result from the recommended improvements. The study An investment-grade energy audit shall contain all of the information required pursuant to \u00a7 1-33B-3. Section 4. That \u00a7 1-33B-3.3 be amended to read: 1-33B-3.3. For the purposes of this chapter, the term, measurement and verification, means the methodology, measurements, inspections, and mathematical calculations to determine utility consumption before and after an energy performance contract is implemented. The measurement and verification report may be for an individual cost-saving measure or an entire project. The governmental unit shall determine which measurement and verification method to utilize. Section 5. That \u00a7 1-33B-3.6 be amended to read: 1-33B-3.6. The governmental unit may negotiate and enter into a contract with the most qualified energy service provider at a price that the governmental unit determines fair and reasonable, taking into account the scope of the services rendered. The provider selected is not required to have submitted the proposal with the lowest cost. If the governmental unit is unable to negotiate a satisfactory contract with the provider, negotiations with that provider shall be formally terminated, and the governmental unit may select the next provider until an agreement is reached or the process is terminated. The governmental unit may choose to reject all proposals. Section 6. That \u00a7 1-33B-3.11 be amended to read: 1-33B-3.11. All permissible sources, including utility incentives, grants, operating costs, or capital budgets, may be used to reduce the amount of financing. An energy performance contract may extend beyond the current fiscal year, but may not exceed fifteen twenty-five years, the cost-weighted average useful life of the cost-saving measure, or the term of financing, whichever is shortest.
