Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of South Dakota: Section 1. That \u00a7 23A-20-1 be REPEALED: Jurors drawn and summoned for the trial of civil actions are also the jurors for the trial of criminal actions. Section 2. That \u00a7 23A-20-2 be REPEALED: When prospective jurors are called for examination, the court shall allow selection by either \u00a7 23A-20-3 or 23A-20-4. Section 3. That \u00a7 23A-20-3 be REPEALED: When prospective jurors are called for examination, the court shall call to the jury box a number of prospective jurors equal to the number of jurors to be impaneled, the number of peremptory challenges allowed the parties, and number of alternates, if any. Section 4. That \u00a7 23A-20-4 be REPEALED: Trial juries for criminal actions may be formed in the same manner as trial juries in \u00a7 15-14-10. Section 5. That \u00a7 23A-20-6 be REPEALED: The defense attorney or the defendant, if appearing pro se, and the prosecuting attorney shall conduct examination of prospective jurors. Prior to the examination the court may conduct a general examination of the prospective jurors. The court may in its discretion allow examination of one or more jurors apart from the other jurors. If approved by the court, prospective jurors may be examined on whether the presence of a certified therapeutic dog to assist a child witness or a witness having a developmental disability would create undue sympathy for the witness or in any way serve as a prejudice to the defendant. For purposes of this section, the terms, certified therapeutic dog, child witness, and developmental disability, have the meanings provided in \u00a7 23A-24-10. Section 6. That \u00a7 23A-20-7 be REPEALED: All members of the panel shall swear or affirm that they will answer truthfully all questions concerning their qualifications by taking the following oath. Do you swear or affirm that you will truthfully answer all questions asked of you by the court or counsel concerning your qualifications to sit as jurors on this case, so help you God? Section 7.

That \u00a7 23A-20-8 be REPEALED: At any time that cause for disqualifying a juror appears, the court shall excuse him and call another member of the panel to take his place in the jury box and on the clerk's list of jurors. Challenges for cause may be made out of hearing of the jurors, but shall be made on the record. Section 9.

(8) The prospective juror is an officer, agent, or employee of a corporation, between which corporation and an attorney in the case, the relationship of attorney and client exists. (9) The prospective juror is the spouse of an attorney in the case. (10) The prospective juror is the spouse of any other prospective juror who would be subject to a challenge for cause under this section. (11) The prospective juror has knowledge of some or all of the material facts of the case and has an unqualified opinion or belief as to the merits of the case.

Section 16.

Section 25. That \u00a7 23A-20-27 be REPEALED: The persons remaining after both parties have exercised their peremptory challenges constitute the jurors for the trial. The jurors remaining who were last called under \u00a7 23A-20-3, 23A-20-4, or 23A-20-8 to make up the full jury box shall be the alternate jurors. Section 26. That \u00a7 23A-20-28 be REPEALED: A court may direct that not more than six jurors in addition to the regular jury members be called and impaneled to sit as alternate jurors. Alternate jurors, in the order in which they were called, shall replace jurors who, prior to the time the jury retires to consider its verdict, become or are found to be disqualified, discharged, or unable to perform their duties. Alternate jurors shall be drawn at the same time and in the same manner, shall have the same qualifications, shall be subject to the same examination and challenges, shall take the same oath and shall have the same functions, powers, facilities, and privileges as regular jurors. An alternate juror who does not replace a regular juror shall be discharged after the jury retires to consider its verdict. Section 27. That \u00a7 23A-20-28.1 be REPEALED: In addition to the method of choosing or seating an alternate juror provided by \u00a7\u00a7 23A-20-27 and 23A-20-28, the judge may choose the alternate jurors by lot, or by such other means as the parties agree on the record. Section 28. That \u00a7 23A-20-29 be REPEALED: If, before the jury retires, a juror or alternate or a member of his immediate family dies, or if he or a member of his immediate family becomes ill, or upon other good cause shown to the court, the court may order him discharged. Section 29. That \u00a7 23A-20-30 be REPEALED: The degree of kindred is established by the number of generations, and each generation is called a degree. The series of degrees form the line; the series of degrees between persons who descend from one another is called direct or lineal consanguinity; and the series of degrees between persons who do not descend from one another, but spring from a common ancestor, is called the collateral line or collateral consanguinity. The direct line is divided into a direct line descending and a direct line ascending. The first is that which connects the ancestor with those who descend from that ancestor. The second is that which connects a person with those from whom that person descends. In the direct line there are as many degrees as there are generations. Thus the son is, with regard to the father, in the first degree; the grandson in the second; and vice versa with regard to the father and grandfather toward the sons and grandsons. In the collateral line the degrees are counted by generations from one of the relations up to the common ancestor, and from the common ancestor to the other relations. In such computation the person whose consanguinity or affinity is being determined is excluded, the relative included, and the ancestor counted but once. Thus brothers are related in the second degree, uncle and nephew in the third degree, cousins germane in the fourth degree, and so on. Section 30. This Act is effective upon the effective date of the Supreme Court's adoption of new court rules concerning the criminal jury trial process."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 23762, "action_date": "2023-01-13T12:30:00-06:00", "document_id": 243286, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/243286.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 34, "committee_id_action": 1159, "committee_id_assigned": 1160, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 23762, "action_date": "2023-01-18T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 243439, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/243439.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 1160, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 23762, "action_date": "2023-01-18T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 243441, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/243441.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 1160, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 76197, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [4358, 4396, 4417, 4366], "Yea": [4438, 4451, 4409, 4458, 4418, 4464, 4446, 4421], "Excused": [4405]}}, {"bill_id": 23762, "action_date": "2023-01-19T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 244441, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/244441.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to another day", "journal_page": 64, "committee_id_action": 1159, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 23762, "action_date": "2023-01-20T13:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 244783, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/244783.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to another day", "journal_page": 70, "committee_id_action": 1159, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 23762, "action_date": "2023-01-23T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 245056, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/245056.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass", "journal_page": 83, "committee_id_action": 1159, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "F", "vote": {"vote_id": 76322, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [4456, 4445, 4333, 4441, 4334, 4337, 4459, 4343, 4344, 4449, 4350, 4351, 4442, 4353, 4354, 4468, 4471, 4358, 4365, 4366, 4368, 4450, 4373, 4374, 4375, 4379, 4462, 4452, 4454, 4384, 4443, 4385, 4451, 4388, 4389, 4469, 4392, 4393, 4447, 4467, 4396, 4397, 4398, 4400, 4401, 4440, 4403, 4437, 4405, 4406, 4408, 4409, 4455, 4444, 4412, 4463, 4439, 4417, 4418, 4464, 4446, 4465, 4461], "Yea": [4341, 4383, 4438, 4458, 4421, 4470, 4429]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/23762"}
