BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 25-7-6.2 be amended to read: 25-7-6.2. The child support obligation shall be established in accordance with the following schedule subject to the revisions or deviations as permitted by this chapter. Except as provided in this chapter, the combined monthly net incomes of both parents shall be used in determining the obligation which shall be divided proportionately between the parents based upon their respective net incomes. The noncustodial parent's proportionate share establishes the amount of the child support order. If the obligation using only the noncustodial parent's monthly net income is an obligation within the emboldened areas of the schedule, that amount shall be compared to the noncustodial parent's proportionate share using both parents' monthly net incomes. The lesser amount establishes the noncustodial parent's child support order. The share of the custodial parent is presumed to be spent directly for the benefit of the child. Section 2. That \u00a7 25-7-6.4 be amended to read: 25-7-6.4. Except in cases of physical or mental disability, it is presumed for the purposes of determination of child support that a parent is capable of being employed at the minimum wage a minimum of one thousand eight hundred twenty hours per year, including while incarcerated, and the parent's child support obligation shall be computed calculated at a rate not less than full-time employment one thousand eight hundred twenty hours at the state minimum wage. Evidence to rebut this presumption may be presented by either parent. Section 3. That \u00a7 25-7-6.13 be amended to read: 25-7-6.13. All orders for support entered and in effect prior to July 1, 2009 2017, may be modified in accordance with this chapter without requiring a showing of a change in circumstances from the entry of the order. Section 4. That \u00a7 25-7-6.22 be amended to read: 25-7-6.22. If a parent is employed full-time at a rate of pay that equals or exceeds the state's minimum wage has annual primary employment earnings that equal or exceed the current state minimum hourly wage multiplied by one thousand eight hundred twenty hours, it is presumed that a parent's second job income is not to be considered in establishing a support obligation. This presumption may be rebutted by evidence that the income source was available to pay expenses related to the child when the parent initially became obligated for the support of the child pursuant to \u00a7 25-7-6.1."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 7825, "action_date": "2017-01-10T12:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 42448, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/42448.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 23, "committee_id_action": 361, "committee_id_assigned": 359, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 7825, "action_date": "2017-01-13T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 42461, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/42461.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 359, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 7825, "action_date": "2017-01-13T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 42552, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/42552.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass", "journal_page": 49, "committee_id_action": 359, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 22270, "president_vote": null, "Excused": [1122, 1113], "Nay": [1142, 1130], "Yea": [1196, 1206, 1160, 1188, 1176, 1121, 1111, 1120, 1158]}}, {"bill_id": 7825, "action_date": "2017-01-17T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 42655, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/42655.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to another day", "journal_page": 72, "committee_id_action": 361, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 7825, "action_date": "2017-01-18T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 42711, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/42711.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass", "journal_page": 75, "committee_id_action": 361, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "F", "vote": {"vote_id": 22339, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [1138, 1153, 1147, 1118, 1180, 1190, 1183, 1116, 1129, 1143, 1142, 1139, 1204, 1159, 1196, 1130, 1191, 1185, 1133, 1200, 1124, 1170, 1110, 1203, 1184, 1134, 1193, 1199, 1165, 1155, 1119, 1140, 1128, 1145, 1187], "Yea": [1168, 1186, 1166, 1112, 1197, 1173, 1114, 1201, 1198, 1136, 1181, 1192, 1120, 1205, 1117, 1125, 1206, 1160, 1188, 1156, 1115, 1113, 1123, 1161, 1195, 1152, 1158, 1176, 1121, 1111, 1149], "Excused": [1122, 1179, 1202, 1150]}}]}
