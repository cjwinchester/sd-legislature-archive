When counting a student who meets these criteria in its general enrollment average daily membership, the receiving district may begin the enrollment on the first day of attendance. The district of residence prior to the custodial transfer may not include students who meet these criteria in its general enrollment average daily membership after the student ceases to attend school in the resident district; (2) \"Adjusted average daily membership,\" calculated as follows: (a) For districts with a general enrollment average daily membership of two hundred or less, multiply 1.2 times the general enrollment average daily membership; (b) For districts with a general enrollment average daily membership of less than six hundred, but greater than two hundred, raise the general enrollment average daily membership to the 0.8293 power and multiply the result times 2.98; (c) For districts with a general enrollment average daily membership of six hundred or more, multiply 1.0 times their general enrollment average daily membership; (3) \"Index factor,\" is the annual percentage change in the consumer price index for urban wage earners and clerical workers as computed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States Department of Labor for the year before the year immediately preceding the year of adjustment or three percent, whichever is less plus the enrollment adjustment ; (3A) \"Enrollment adjustment,\" is the negative of the annual percent change in the statewide general enrollment average daily membership for the year before the year immediately preceding the year of adjustment. However, the enrollment adjustment may not be less than zero; (4) \"Per student allocation,\" for the period January 1, 1997, to June 30, 1997, inclusive, is $1,675. For school fiscal year 1998, beginning on July 1, 1997, the per student allocation shall be $3,350 increased by the index factor.
