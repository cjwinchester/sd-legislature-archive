Any livestock so acquired shall be disposed of within six months; (12) Agricultural lands held by a state or nationally chartered bank as trustee for a person, corporation or syndicate that is otherwise exempt from the provisions of \u00a7 \u00a7 21 to 24, inclusive, of Article XVII; (13) A bona fide encumbrance taken for purposes of security; (14) Custom spraying, fertilizing, or harvesting; (15) Livestock futures contracts, livestock purchased for slaughter within two weeks of the purchase date, or livestock purchased and resold within two weeks.

If a family farm corporation or family farm syndicate that has qualified under all the requirements of a family farm corporation or a family farm syndicate ceases to meet the defined criteria, it has twenty years, if the ownership of the majority of the stock of such corporation, or the majority of the ownership interest of such syndicate, continues to be held by persons related to one another within the fourth degree of kinship or their spouses, and their land holdings are not increased, to either requalify as a family farm corporation or family farm syndicate or dissolve and return to personal ownership. Section 5. That Article XVII, section 24 of the Constitution of the State of South Dakota, be repealed: \u00a7 24. Any corporation or syndicate that owns agricultural land or engages in farming is required to report information necessary for the enforcement of \u00a7 \u00a7 21 to 24, inclusive, of Article XVII to the secretary of state on an annual basis, under rules promulgated by the secretary pursuant to state law. The secretary of state shall monitor such reports and notify the attorney general of any possible violations, and any resident of the state may also notify the attorney general of any possible violations.

The court shall order any land held in violation of \u00a7 \u00a7 21 to 24 of Article XVII to be divested within two years and any livestock to be divested within six months. If land so ordered by the court has not been divested within two years, the court shall declare the land escheated to the state. If the attorney general fails to bring an action in circuit court to enforce \u00a7 \u00a7 21 to 24, inclusive, of Article XVII, any resident of the state has standing in circuit court to sue for enforcement. Section 6. That Article XVII of the Constitution of the State of South Dakota be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: \u00a7 25. No corporation may engage in farming or acquire, or otherwise obtain an interest, whether legal, beneficial, or otherwise, in any agricultural land in this state. For purposes of this section, the term, farming, means the ownership of livestock for more than two consecutive weeks, or the cultivation of land for the production of crops or horticultural products. For purposes of this section, the term, corporation, means any legal entity that limits the liability of any investor or owner, except: (1) An entity in which all investors are natural persons, and one of the investors is actively engaged in the day-to-day management of the farm land or farm operation; (2) An entity in which a majority of the voting rights are owned by qualified persons who own agricultural land or an interest in a farming operation. For purposes of this subdivision, a qualified person is either a natural person or an entity that meets the requirements of subdivision (1) of this section; (3) An entity that engages in farming primarily for scientific, medical, research, or experimental purposes; (4) An entity that owns only a mineral right, a right-of-way, a utility easement, a transportation easement, a water line easement, a drainage easement, a telecommunication easement, or any less than fee simple interest in land which is held primarily for a nonfarming purpose or use; (5) An entity that purchases any interest in agricultural land primarily for a nonfarming purpose, if the nonfarming purpose is applied to the land within five years of the date of purchase. This exemption applies if the land is used for the nonfarming purpose, and if any farming operations on such land are merely incidental to the primary use and are conducted by contract or lease to a person or entity who is not otherwise prohibited from farming or owning agricultural land in this state; (6) An entity that is a lender and acquires land or livestock as collateral on a debt, if the lender disposes of the land within five years and the livestock within one year of acquisition; (7) A trustee holding lands or livestock for the benefit of persons or entities who are not prohibited from farming or owning agricultural land in South Dakota; (8) An entity or person with a vested property interest in agricultural land or farming on June 1, 2002, or who lawfully engaged in farming or owned agricultural land in this state on November 1, 1998. However, no expansion is allowed under this exemption beyond the size and extent of the farming operation on June 1, 2002; and (9) A nonprofit entity as defined in law by the South Dakota Legislature."}, {"bill_id": 17408, "bill_version_id": 94649, "bill_version": "Enrolled", "bill_version_date": "2002-02-20T09:04:29-06:00", "bill_text": ""}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [],
