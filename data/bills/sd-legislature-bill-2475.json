That chapter 32-23 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: For the purposes of this Act, the term, ignition interlock device, means breath alcohol ignition equipment designed to prevent a motor vehicle's ignition from being started by a person whose alcohol concentration exceeds the level prescribed by \u00a7 32-23-1. Section 2. That \u00a7 32-23-3 be amended to read as follows: 32-23-3. If conviction for a violation of \u00a7 32-23-1 is for a second offense, such person is guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor, and the court shall, in pronouncing sentence, unconditionally revoke the defendant's driving privilege for a period of not less than one year. However, upon the successful completion of a court-approved chemical dependency program, and proof of financial responsibility pursuant to \u00a7 32-35-113, the court may permit the person to drive for the purposes of employment, 24/7 sobriety testing, attendance at school, or attendance at counseling programs.

The court shall require the person to pay the reasonable cost of leasing, installing, and maintaining the device. If such person is convicted of driving without a license during that period, the person shall be sentenced to the county jail for not less than three days, which sentence may not be suspended. Section 3.

The secretary of the Department of Public Safety shall promulgate rules, pursuant to chapter 1-26, to establish performance standards for ignition interlock devices. The rules shall include standards relating to accuracy of the device, the means of installing the device, and the degree of difficulty rendering the device inoperative. Section 4.

Section 5. That chapter 32-23 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: No person may knowingly circumvent the operation of an ignition interlock device.
