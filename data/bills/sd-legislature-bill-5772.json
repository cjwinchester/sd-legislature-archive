BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 32-5-2.7 be amended to read as follows: 32-5-2.7. If the ownership of a vehicle registered pursuant to the provisions of this chapter is transferred or assigned, the transferor shall remove the number plates from the vehicle and shall receive credit for the unexpired months at the time the plates are attached to another vehicle. No refund may be issued if the plate is detached, remains in the possession of the transferor, and is not reattached. However, if the transferor returns the number plates to the possession of the county treasurer, the transferor shall receive a credit for the unexpired months remaining for the time the plates are returned to the county treasurer. The county treasurer shall issue to the transferor a warrant for an amount equal to a pro rata share for the remaining months of the year less a five dollar administrative fee to be retained by the county. The number plates must be in the possession of the county treasurer on or before the fifth day of the month to receive credit for that month. If the transferor fails to remove or return the number plates pursuant to this section, the transferor loses any credit and the plates are no longer valid. A violation of this section is a Class 2 misdemeanor."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 5772, "action_date": "2014-01-29T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 29326, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/29326.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 157, "committee_id_action": 231, "committee_id_assigned": 222, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 5772, "action_date": "2014-02-11T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 29963, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/29963.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 222, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 5772, "action_date": "2014-02-11T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 30179, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/30179.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 222, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "D", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 5772, "action_date": "2014-02-11T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 30179, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/30179.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to the 41st legislative day", "journal_page": 370, "committee_id_action": 222, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 15916, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [524, 509, 501, 520, 487, 510, 468, 498, 484, 518], "Nay": [499, 500], "Excused": [439]}}]}
