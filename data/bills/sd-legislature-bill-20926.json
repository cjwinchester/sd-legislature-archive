BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. Terms used in this Act mean: (1) \"Nonprofit excursion,\" the provision of transportation to invited passengers for no charge by a railroad primarily engaged in freight service; (2) \"Rail facility provider,\" any person, railroad, corporation, or other entity providing facilities or equipment for use by a passenger train provider; (3) \"Rail passenger or excursion train,\" any service and activity provided by a railroad in connection with transportation of passengers, including the operation of trains, trackage, and equipment, or the use or maintenance of railroad equipment, tracks, and any appurtenant facilities, including equipment, tracks, or facilities of a rail facility provider; (4) \"Passenger train provider,\" any regional railroad authority formed pursuant to chapter 49-17A, political subdivision of the state, or nonprofit organization that contracts with any transportation provider for rail passenger or excursion train service. The term includes any corporation or other entity that owns, leases, operates, or manages rail passenger or excursion train service. The term also includes any railroad company or entity that owns, leases, or provides trackage rights to or maintains rail lines over which a rail passenger or excursion train passes within the state of South Dakota. Section 2. The maximum liability of any passenger train provider shall be applied in the aggregate for any claims or awards, compensatory or punitive, for property damage, personal injury, bodily injury, or death arising from a single rail incident or accident occurring in this state and involving a rail passenger or excursion train as follows: This section only applies to a passenger train provider that secures and maintains liability insurance that equals or exceeds the maximum liability amounts specified in this section per occurrence in the aggregate. If a passenger train provider fails to secure and maintain self insurance or liability insurance that has policy limits of not less than the applicable amount specified in this section per occurrence in the aggregate, the liability limitation of this section does not apply to that provider. The applicable amount specified in this section per occurrence in the aggregate is the maximum amount for all claims and awards against each potentially responsible passenger train provider involved in a rail incident or accident. The maximum liability amounts provided in this section do no apply to any passenger train provider that was operating prior to December 31, 2006. The maximum liability for a passenger train provider that was operating prior to December 31, 2006, shall be equal to but not less than the liability insurance amounts carried by those passenger providers on December 31, 2006. Section 3. A passenger train provider may enter into contracts that allocate financial responsibility for claims or awards. Notwithstanding any statute, public policy, common law, or other prohibition to the same, this authority includes the right of any rail facility provider to limit its liability by indemnification or otherwise in contracts allowing rail passenger or excursion train rail transportation services on its lines of rail, including any provision that makes the passenger train provider solely responsible for any claim, damage, or award. Section 4. This Act does not affect any immunity, limitation on damage, limitation of action, limitation of liability, or any other protection provided to the state. Section 5. Nothing in this Act may be construed as requiring a railroad or rail authority to permit the operation of a special passenger excursion train over its tracks. Section 6. Nothing in this Act may be construed to limit any employee's rights under the Federal Employers' Liability Act of 1908 as of January 1, 2007, or under any collective bargaining agreement as of January 1, 2007."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 20926, "action_date": "2007-01-25T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 110857, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/110857.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 199, "committee_id_action": 923, "committee_id_assigned": 921, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 20926, "action_date": "2007-02-05T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 111530, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/111530.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 921, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 20926, "action_date": "2007-02-07T07:30:00-06:00", "document_id": 111725, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/111725.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 921, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 20926, "action_date": "2007-02-12T07:30:00-06:00", "document_id": 112013, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/112013.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 921, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 20926, "action_date": "2007-02-14T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 112245, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/112245.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 921, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 20926, "action_date": "2007-02-14T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 112245, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/112245.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to 41st legislative day", "journal_page": 514, "committee_id_action": 921, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 65163, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [3579, 3592, 3594, 3598, 3599, 3619, 3638, 3651, 3672, 3676, 3582], "Nay": [3632], "Excused": [3673]}}]}
