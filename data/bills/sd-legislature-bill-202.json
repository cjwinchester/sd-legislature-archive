Any adjustments in the levies specified in subdivision 13-13-10.1(6) \u00a7 10-12-42 made pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 13-13-71 and 13-13-72 shall be based on maintaining the relationship between statewide local effort as a percentage of statewide local need in the fiscal year succeeding the fiscal year in which the adjustment is made. In addition to the adjustments in the levies provided by this section, the levies shall also be annually adjusted as necessary to reduce the portion of local need paid by local effort by an amount equal to nine million dollars from those funds transferred into the property tax reduction fund pursuant to \u00a7 10-50-52 subsequent to July 1, 2007. In addition to the adjustments in the levies provided by this section, the levies for nonagricultural property and owner-occupied single-family dwellings shall also be adjusted as necessary to account for the additional increase in the total assessed value for nonagricultural property and owner-occupied single-family dwellings pursuant to the phasing out and repeal of the provisions provided in \u00a7 10-6-74. Section 2. That \u00a7 13-16-7 be amended to read as follows: 13-16-7. The school board of any school district of this state may at its discretion authorize an annual levy of a tax not to exceed three dollars per thousand dollars of taxable valuation on the taxable valuation of the district for the capital outlay fund for assets as defined by \u00a7 13-16-6 or for its obligations under a resolution, lease-purchase agreement, capital outlay certificate, or other arrangement with the Health and Educational Facilities Authority. Taxes collected pursuant to such levy may be irrevocably pledged by the school board to the payment of principal of and interest on installment purchase contracts or capital outlay certificates entered into or issued pursuant to \u00a7 13-16-6 or 13-16-6.2 or lease-purchase agreements or other arrangement with the Health and Educational Facilities Authority and, so long as any capital outlay certificates are outstanding, installment agreement payments, lease-purchase agreements, or other arrangements are unpaid, the school board of any district may be compelled by mandamus or other appropriate remedy to levy an annual tax sufficient to pay principal and interest thereon, but not to exceed the three dollars per thousand dollars of taxable valuation in any year authorized to be levied hereby. For taxes payable in 2010, the total amount of revenue payable from the levy provided in this section may not increase more than the lesser of three percent or the index factor, as defined in \u00a7 10-13-38, over the maximum amount of revenue that could have been generated for the taxes payable in 2009.
