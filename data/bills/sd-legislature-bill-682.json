A discretionary interest includes may be evidenced by permissive language such as \"may make distributions\" or it may include be evidenced by mandatory distribution language that is negated by the uncontrolled discretionary language of the trustee trust , such as \"the trustee shall make distributions in the trustee's sole and absolute discretion.\" A support An interest that includes mandatory distribution language such as \"shall\" but is subsequently qualified by discretionary distribution language shall be classified as a discretionary interest and not as a support or a mandatory interest. A discretionary interest is any interest that is not a mandatory or a support interest. Section 8. That chapter 55-1 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: If a trust instrument containing the distribution language specifically provides that the trustee exercise discretion in a reasonable manner with regard to a discretionary interest, then notwithstanding any other provision of \u00a7 \u00a7 55-1-38 to 55-1-43, inclusive, the distribution interest shall be classified as a support interest.

That \u00a7 55-1-41 be amended to read as follows: 55-1-41. If the trust contains a spendthrift provision, no creditor may attach reach present or future mandatory distributions from the trust at the trust level. Moreover, no court may order a trustee to distribute past due mandatory distributions directly to a creditor. Section 10. That \u00a7 55-1-42 be amended to read as follows: 55-1-42. The following provisions apply only to support interests: (1) A beneficiary of a mandatory or a support interest has an enforceable right to a distribution pursuant to a court's review. A trustee's distribution decision may be reviewed for unreasonableness, dishonesty, improper motivation, or failure , if under a duty to do so, to act. This does not , however, raise the beneficiary's support interest to the level of a property interest ; (2) . If the trust contains a spendthrift provision, notwithstanding the beneficiary's right to force a distribution of a with regard to a mandatory or support interest, no creditor may force a distribution of a with regard to a mandatory or support interest. No creditor may attach reach present or future support distributions of a with regard to a mandatory or support interest at the trust level . With respect to a mandatory interest, if a trust contains a spendthrift provision, notwithstanding the beneficiary's right to force a distribution of a mandatory interest, no creditor may force a distribution of a mandatory interest. No creditor may attach present or future mandatory distributions of a mandatory interest at the trust level. Regardless of whether a beneficiary has any outstanding creditor, a trustee of a mandatory or a support interest may directly pay any expense on behalf of such beneficiary. No trustee is liable to any creditor for paying the expenses of a beneficiary who holds of a mandatory or support interest. Section 11. That \u00a7 55-1-43 be amended to read as follows: 55-1-43. The following provisions apply only to discretionary interests: (1) A discretionary interest is neither a property interest nor an enforceable right. It is a mere expectancy; (2) No creditor may force a distribution with regard to a discretionary interest. No creditor may require the trustee to exercise the trustee's discretion to make a distribution , or cause a court to foreclose with regard to a discretionary interest; (3) A court may review a trustee's distribution discretion only if the trustee: (a) Acts dishonestly; (b) Acts with an improper motive; or (c) Fails , if under a duty to do so, to act. Words such as sole, absolute, uncontrolled, or unfettered discretion dispense with the trustee acting reasonably. A reasonableness standard may not be applied to the exercise of discretion by the trustee with regard to a discretionary interest. Other than for the three circumstances listed in this subdivision, a court has no jurisdiction to review the trustee's discretion or to force a distribution. Absent express language to the contrary, in the event that the distribution language in a discretionary interest permits unequal distributions between beneficiaries or distributions to the exclusion of other beneficiaries, the trustee may distribute all of the accumulated, accrued, or undistributed income and principal to one beneficiary in the trustee's discretion. Regardless of whether a beneficiary has any outstanding creditor, a trustee of a discretionary interest may directly pay any expense on behalf of such beneficiary and may exhaust the income and principal of the trust for the benefit of such beneficiary. No trustee is liable to any creditor for paying the expenses of a beneficiary who holds of a discretionary interest. Section 12. That \u00a7 55-1A-9.1 be amended to read as follows: 55-1A-9.1.

That chapter 55-4 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: A recipient of a certificate of trust may require the trustee to furnish copies of those excerpts from the original trust instrument and later amendments that designate the trustee and confer on the trustee the power to act in the pending transaction.

Section 30. That \u00a7 55-5-7 be amended to read as follows: 55-5-7. No specific investment or course of action is, taken alone, prudent or imprudent. The trustee may invest in every kind of property and type of investment, subject to this chapter. The trustee's investment decisions and actions shall be judged in terms of the trustee's reasonable business judgment regarding the anticipated effect on the trust portfolio as a whole under the facts and circumstances prevailing at the time of the decision or action. The prudent investor rule is a test of conduct and not of resulting performance. The prudent investor rule may be expanded, restricted, eliminated, or otherwise altered by the terms of the trust instrument or court order. No trustee is liable to a beneficiary to the extent that the trustee acted in reliance on the provisions of the trust instrument or court order. Section 31. That \u00a7 55-5-8 be amended to read as follows: 55-5-8. The trustee shall diversify the investments of the trust unless, under the circumstances, the trustee reasonably believes it is in the interests of the beneficiaries and furthers the purposes of the trust not to diversify. Regardless of concentration or lack of diversification, the trustee need not diversify if the trust instrument or court order allows or directs retention of assets forming part of the trust corpus. If a trust instrument or court order requires a fiduciary to invest in a specific investment, type of investment, or investment concentration, no trustee is liable to a beneficiary to the extent that the trustee acted in reliance on the provisions of the trust instrument or court order.

The trustee shall, within a reasonable time after the acceptance of the trusteeship, review trust assets and make and implement decisions concerning the retention and disposition of original pre-existing investments in order to conform to the provisions of this section. The trustee's decision to retain or dispose of an asset may properly be influenced by the asset's special relationship or value to the purposes of the trust or to some or all of the beneficiaries, consistent with the trustee's duty of impartiality. If a trust owns an interest in a closely held entity, and the trust agreement provides that the trustee has no duty to inquire or review the activities of the closely held entity, no trustee is liable to a beneficiary to the extent that the trustee acted in reliance on the provisions of the trust or court order. For purposes of this section, the term, closely held entity, means any entity in which the following persons in aggregate own at least twenty percent of the entity: (1) The settlor; (2) The settlor's grandparents or their descendants; (3) The settlor's spouse; or (4) Any trust created by anyone of the aforementioned persons. Section 33. That \u00a7 55-13A-104 be amended to read as follows: 55-13A-104. (a) A trustee may adjust between principal and income to the extent the trustee considers necessary if the trustee invests and manages trust assets as a prudent investor, the terms of the trust describe the amount that may or must be distributed to a beneficiary by referring to the trust's income, and the trustee determines, after applying the rules in \u00a7 55-13A- 103(a), that the trustee is unable to comply with \u00a7 55-13A-103(b). (b) In deciding whether and to what extent to exercise the power conferred by subsection (a), a trustee shall consider all factors relevant to the trust and its beneficiaries, including the following factors to the extent they are relevant: (1) The nature, purpose, and expected duration of the trust; (2) The intent of the settlor; (3) The identity and circumstances of the beneficiaries; (4) The needs for liquidity, regularity of income, and preservation and appreciation of capital; (5) The assets held in the trust; the extent to which they consist of financial assets, interests in closely held enterprises, tangible and intangible personal property, or real property; the extent to which an asset is used by a beneficiary; and whether an asset was purchased by the trustee or received from the settlor; (6) The net amount allocated to income under the other sections of this chapter and the increase or decrease in the value of the principal assets, which the trustee may estimate as to assets for which market values are not readily available; (7) Whether and to what extent the terms of the trust give the trustee the power to invade principal or accumulate income or prohibit the trustee from invading principal or accumulating income, and the extent to which the trustee has exercised a power from time to time to invade principal or accumulate income; (8) The actual and anticipated effect of economic conditions on principal and income and effects of inflation and deflation; and (9) The anticipated tax consequences of an adjustment. (c) A trustee may not make an adjustment: (1) That diminishes the income interest in a trust that requires all of the income to be paid at least annually to a spouse and for which an estate tax or gift tax marital deduction would be allowed, in whole or in part, if the trustee did not have the power to make the adjustment; (2) That reduces the actuarial value of the income interest in a trust to which a person transfers property with the intent to qualify for a gift tax exclusion; (3) That changes the amount payable to a beneficiary as a fixed annuity or a fixed fraction of the value of the trust assets; (4) From any amount that is permanently set aside for charitable purposes under a will or the terms of a trust unless both income and principal are so set aside; (5) If possessing or exercising the power to make an adjustment causes an individual to be treated as the owner of all or part of the trust for income tax purposes, and the individual would not be treated as the owner if the trustee did not possess the power to make an adjustment; (6) If possessing or exercising the power to make an adjustment causes all or part of the trust assets to be included for estate tax purposes in the estate of an individual who has the power to remove a trustee or appoint a trustee, or both, and the assets would not be included in the estate of the individual if the trustee did not possess the power to make an adjustment; (7) If the trustee is a beneficiary of the trust; or (8) If the trustee is not a beneficiary, but the adjustment would benefit the trustee directly or indirectly. (d) If subsection (c)(5), (6), (7), or (8) applies to a trustee and there is more than one trustee, a cotrustee to whom the provision does not apply may make the adjustment unless the exercise of the power by the remaining trustee or trustees is not permitted by the terms of the trust. (e) A trustee may release the entire power conferred by subsection (a) or may release only the power to adjust from income to principal or the power to adjust from principal to income if the trustee is uncertain about whether possessing or exercising the power will cause a result described in subsection (c)(1) through (6) or (c)(8) or if the trustee determines that possessing or exercising the power will or may deprive the trust of a tax benefit or impose a tax burden not described in subsection (c). The release may be permanent or for a specified period, including a period measured by the life of an individual. (f) Terms of a trust that limit the power of a trustee to make an adjustment between principal and income do not affect the application of this section unless it is clear from the terms of the trust that the terms are intended to deny the trustee the power of adjustment conferred by subsection (a). (g) Unless prohibited by the governing instrument, the trustee of a trust has the power to consider gains from the sale of capital assets in the trust to be part of a distribution of principal to a beneficiary, or part of an adjustment from principal to income, and if such power is exercised, such gains shall be treated consistently by the trustee on the trust's books, records, and tax returns as part of a distribution to a beneficiary.

(c) The increase in value of the obligations described in subsection (a) is distributable to the beneficiary who was the income beneficiary at the time of the increase from the first principal cash available or, if none is available, when realized by sale, redemption, or other disposition. If unrealized increase is distributed as income but out of principal, the principal shall be reimbursed from the increase when realized. Section 35. That \u00a7 55-13A-409 be amended to read as follows: 55-13A-409. (a) In this section , the term, payment, : (1) \"Payment\" means a payment that a trustee may receive over a fixed number of years or during the life of one or more individuals because of services rendered or property transferred to the payer in exchange for future payments. The term includes a payment made in money or property from the payer's general assets or from a separate fund created by the payer , including . For purposes of subsections (d), (e), (f), and (g), the term also includes any payment from any separate fund, regardless of the reason for the payment. (2) \"Separate fund\" includes a private or commercial annuity, an individual retirement account, and a pension, profit-sharing, stock-bonus, or stock-ownership plan. (b) To the extent that a payment is characterized as interest or , a dividend , or a payment made in lieu of interest or a dividend, a trustee shall allocate it the payment to income. The trustee shall allocate to principal the balance of the payment and any other payment received in the same accounting period that is not characterized as interest, a dividend, or an equivalent payment. (c) If no part of a payment is characterized as interest, a dividend, or an equivalent payment, and all or part of the payment is required to be made, a trustee shall allocate to income ten percent of the part that is required to be made during the accounting period and the balance to principal. If no part of a payment is required to be made or the payment received is the entire amount to which the trustee is entitled, the trustee shall allocate the entire payment to principal. For purposes of this subsection, a payment is not required to be made to the extent that it is made because the trustee exercises a right of withdrawal. (d) If, to obtain an estate tax marital deduction for a trust, a trustee must allocate more of a payment to income than provided for by this section, the trustee shall allocate to income the additional amount necessary to obtain the marital deduction. (e) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (e), subsections (f) and (g) apply, and subsections (b) and (c) do not apply, in determining the allocation of a payment made from a separate fund to: (1) A trust to which an election to qualify for a marital deduction under Section 2056(b)(7) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, has been made; or (2) A trust that qualifies for the marital deduction under Section 2056(b)(5) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.

(f) A trustee shall determine the internal income of each separate fund for the accounting period as if the separate fund were a trust subject to this chapter. Upon request of the surviving spouse, the trustee shall demand that the person administering the separate fund distribute the internal income to the trust. The trustee shall allocate a payment from the separate fund to income to the extent of the internal income of the separate fund and distribute that amount to the surviving spouse. The trustee shall allocate the balance of the payment to principal. Upon request of the surviving spouse, the trustee shall allocate principal to income to the extent the internal income of the separate fund exceeds payments made from the separate fund to the trust during the accounting period. (g) If a trustee cannot determine the internal income of a separate fund but can determine the value of the separate fund, the internal income of the separate fund is deemed to equal four percent of the fund's value, according to the most recent statement of value preceding the beginning of the accounting period. If the trustee can determine neither the internal income of the separate fund nor the fund's value, the internal income of the fund is deemed to equal the product of the interest rate and the present value of the expected future payments, as determined under Section 7520 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. Section 7520), for the month preceding the accounting period for which the computation is made. (h) This section does not apply to payments a payment to which \u00a7 55-13A-410 applies. Section 36.

(d) For purposes of this section, receipts allocated to principal or income must be reduced by the amount distributed to a beneficiary from principal or income for which the trust receives a deduction in calculating the tax. After applying subsections (1) through (c), the trustee shall adjust income or principal receipts to the extent that the trust's taxes are reduced because the trust receives a deduction for payments made to a beneficiary.

However, such election by the trustee, the disinterested person, or the court in determining the unitrust amount shall be three percent or greater; (4) The unitrust amount for the current valuation year shall be proportionately reduced for any distributions, in whole or in part, other than distributions of the unitrust amount, and for any payments of expenses, including debts, disbursements and taxes, from the trust within a current valuation year that the trustee determines to be material and substantial, and shall be proportionately increased for the receipt, other than a receipt that represents a return on investment, of any additional property into the trust within a current valuation year; (5) In the case of a short accounting period, the trustee shall prorate the unitrust amount on a daily basis; (6) If the net fair market value of an asset held in the trust has been incorrectly determined either in a current valuation year or in a prior valuation year, the unitrust amount shall be increased in the case of an undervaluation, or be decreased in the case of an overvaluation, by an amount equal to the difference between the unitrust amount determined based on the correct valuation of the asset and the unitrust amount originally determined; (7) In determining the net fair market value of the assets held in trust, the determination may not include the value of any residential property or any tangible personal property that, as of the first business day of the current valuation year, one or more income beneficiaries of the trust have or had the right to occupy, or have or had the right to possess or control, other than in a capacity as trustee, and instead the right of occupancy or the right of possession or control shall be deemed to be the unitrust amount with respect to the residential property or the tangible personal property; or any asset specifically given to a beneficiary under the terms of the trust and the return on investment on that asset, which return on investment shall be distributed to the beneficiary.

That chapter 55-1 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: If a trust instrument containing the distribution language specifically provides that the trustee exercise discretion in a reasonable manner with regard to a discretionary interest, then notwithstanding any other provision of \u00a7 \u00a7 55-1-38 to 55-1-43, inclusive, the distribution interest shall be classified as a support interest.

With respect to a mandatory interest, if a trust contains a spendthrift provision, notwithstanding the beneficiary's right to force a distribution of a mandatory interest, no creditor may force a distribution of a mandatory interest. No creditor may attach present or future mandatory distributions of a mandatory interest at the trust level. Regardless of whether a beneficiary has any outstanding creditor, a trustee of a mandatory or a support interest may directly pay any expense on behalf of such beneficiary. No trustee is liable to any creditor for paying the expenses of a beneficiary who holds of a mandatory or support interest. Section 11. That \u00a7 55-1-43 be amended to read as follows: 55-1-43. The following provisions apply only to discretionary interests: (1) A discretionary interest is neither a property interest nor an enforceable right. It is a mere expectancy; (2) No creditor may force a distribution with regard to a discretionary interest. No creditor may require the trustee to exercise the trustee's discretion to make a distribution , or cause a court to foreclose with regard to a discretionary interest; (3) A court may review a trustee's distribution discretion only if the trustee: (a) Acts dishonestly; (b) Acts with an improper motive; or (c) Fails , if under a duty to do so, to act.

A reasonableness standard may not be applied to the exercise of discretion by the trustee with regard to a discretionary interest. Other than for the three circumstances listed in this subdivision, a court has no jurisdiction to review the trustee's discretion or to force a distribution. Absent express language to the contrary, in the event that the distribution language in a discretionary interest permits unequal distributions between beneficiaries or distributions to the exclusion of other beneficiaries, the trustee may distribute all of the accumulated, accrued, or undistributed income and principal to one beneficiary in the trustee's discretion. Regardless of whether a beneficiary has any outstanding creditor, a trustee of a discretionary interest may directly pay any expense on behalf of such beneficiary and may exhaust the income and principal of the trust for the benefit of such beneficiary. No trustee is liable to any creditor for paying the expenses of a beneficiary who holds of a discretionary interest. Section 12. That \u00a7 55-1A-9.1 be amended to read as follows: 55-1A-9.1.

The trustee's decision to retain or dispose of an asset may properly be influenced by the asset's special relationship or value to the purposes of the trust or to some or all of the beneficiaries, consistent with the trustee's duty of impartiality. If a trust owns an interest in a closely held entity, and the trust agreement provides that the trustee has no duty to inquire or review the activities of the closely held entity, no trustee is liable to a beneficiary to the extent that the trustee acted in reliance on the provisions of the trust or court order. For purposes of this section, the term, closely held entity, means any entity in which the following persons in aggregate own at least twenty percent of the entity: (1) The settlor; (2) The settlor's grandparents or their descendants; (3) The settlor's spouse; or (4) Any trust created by anyone of the aforementioned persons. Section 33. That \u00a7 55-13A-104 be amended to read as follows: 55-13A-104. (a) A trustee may adjust between principal and income to the extent the trustee considers necessary if the trustee invests and manages trust assets as a prudent investor, the terms of the trust describe the amount that may or must be distributed to a beneficiary by referring to the trust's income, and the trustee determines, after applying the rules in \u00a7 55-13A- 103(a), that the trustee is unable to comply with \u00a7 55-13A-103(b). (b) In deciding whether and to what extent to exercise the power conferred by subsection (a), a trustee shall consider all factors relevant to the trust and its beneficiaries, including the following factors to the extent they are relevant: (1) The nature, purpose, and expected duration of the trust; (2) The intent of the settlor; (3) The identity and circumstances of the beneficiaries; (4) The needs for liquidity, regularity of income, and preservation and appreciation of capital; (5) The assets held in the trust; the extent to which they consist of financial assets, interests in closely held enterprises, tangible and intangible personal property, or real property; the extent to which an asset is used by a beneficiary; and whether an asset was purchased by the trustee or received from the settlor; (6) The net amount allocated to income under the other sections of this chapter and the increase or decrease in the value of the principal assets, which the trustee may estimate as to assets for which market values are not readily available; (7) Whether and to what extent the terms of the trust give the trustee the power to invade principal or accumulate income or prohibit the trustee from invading principal or accumulating income, and the extent to which the trustee has exercised a power from time to time to invade principal or accumulate income; (8) The actual and anticipated effect of economic conditions on principal and income and effects of inflation and deflation; and (9) The anticipated tax consequences of an adjustment. (c) A trustee may not make an adjustment: (1) That diminishes the income interest in a trust that requires all of the income to be paid at least annually to a spouse and for which an estate tax or gift tax marital deduction would be allowed, in whole or in part, if the trustee did not have the power to make the adjustment; (2) That reduces the actuarial value of the income interest in a trust to which a person transfers property with the intent to qualify for a gift tax exclusion; (3) That changes the amount payable to a beneficiary as a fixed annuity or a fixed fraction of the value of the trust assets; (4) From any amount that is permanently set aside for charitable purposes under a will or the terms of a trust unless both income and principal are so set aside; (5) If possessing or exercising the power to make an adjustment causes an individual to be treated as the owner of all or part of the trust for income tax purposes, and the individual would not be treated as the owner if the trustee did not possess the power to make an adjustment; (6) If possessing or exercising the power to make an adjustment causes all or part of the trust assets to be included for estate tax purposes in the estate of an individual who has the power to remove a trustee or appoint a trustee, or both, and the assets would not be included in the estate of the individual if the trustee did not possess the power to make an adjustment; (7) If the trustee is a beneficiary of the trust; or (8) If the trustee is not a beneficiary, but the adjustment would benefit the trustee directly or indirectly. (d) If subsection (c)(5), (6), (7), or (8) applies to a trustee and there is more than one trustee, a cotrustee to whom the provision does not apply may make the adjustment unless the exercise of the power by the remaining trustee or trustees is not permitted by the terms of the trust. (e) A trustee may release the entire power conferred by subsection (a) or may release only the power to adjust from income to principal or the power to adjust from principal to income if the trustee is uncertain about whether possessing or exercising the power will cause a result described in subsection (c)(1) through (6) or (c)(8) or if the trustee determines that possessing or exercising the power will or may deprive the trust of a tax benefit or impose a tax burden not described in subsection (c). The release may be permanent or for a specified period, including a period measured by the life of an individual. (f) Terms of a trust that limit the power of a trustee to make an adjustment between principal and income do not affect the application of this section unless it is clear from the terms of the trust that the terms are intended to deny the trustee the power of adjustment conferred by subsection (a). (g) Unless prohibited by the governing instrument, the trustee of a trust has the power to consider gains from the sale of capital assets in the trust to be part of a distribution of principal to a beneficiary, or part of an adjustment from principal to income, and if such power is exercised, such gains shall be treated consistently by the trustee on the trust's books, records, and tax returns as part of a distribution to a beneficiary. Section 34. That \u00a7 55-13A-202 be amended to read as follows: 55-13A-202.

(b) For purposes of this section, the increase in value of an investment described in subsection (a) is available for distribution only if the trustee receives cash on account of the investment. (c) The increase in value of the obligations described in subsection (a) is distributable to the beneficiary who was the income beneficiary at the time of the increase from the first principal cash available or, if none is available, when realized by sale, redemption, or other disposition. If unrealized increase is distributed as income but out of principal, the principal shall be reimbursed from the increase when realized. Section 35. That \u00a7 55-13A-409 be amended to read as follows: 55-13A-409. (a) In this section , the term, payment, : (1) \"Payment\" means a payment that a trustee may receive over a fixed number of years or during the life of one or more individuals because of services rendered or property transferred to the payer in exchange for future payments. The term includes a payment made in money or property from the payer's general assets or from a separate fund created by the payer , including . For purposes of subsections (d), (e), (f), and (g), the term also includes any payment from any separate fund, regardless of the reason for the payment. (2) \"Separate fund\" includes a private or commercial annuity, an individual retirement account, and a pension, profit-sharing, stock-bonus, or stock-ownership plan. (b) To the extent that a payment is characterized as interest or , a dividend , or a payment made in lieu of interest or a dividend, a trustee shall allocate it the payment to income. The trustee shall allocate to principal the balance of the payment and any other payment received in the same accounting period that is not characterized as interest, a dividend, or an equivalent payment. (c) If no part of a payment is characterized as interest, a dividend, or an equivalent payment, and all or part of the payment is required to be made, a trustee shall allocate to income ten percent of the part that is required to be made during the accounting period and the balance to principal. If no part of a payment is required to be made or the payment received is the entire amount to which the trustee is entitled, the trustee shall allocate the entire payment to principal. For purposes of this subsection, a payment is not required to be made to the extent that it is made because the trustee exercises a right of withdrawal. (d) If, to obtain an estate tax marital deduction for a trust, a trustee must allocate more of a payment to income than provided for by this section, the trustee shall allocate to income the additional amount necessary to obtain the marital deduction. (e) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (e), subsections (f) and (g) apply, and subsections (b) and (c) do not apply, in determining the allocation of a payment made from a separate fund to: (1) A trust to which an election to qualify for a marital deduction under Section 2056(b)(7) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, has been made; or (2) A trust that qualifies for the marital deduction under Section 2056(b)(5) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. (e) Subsections (d), (f), and (g) do not apply if and to the extent that the series of payments would, without the application of subsection (d), qualify for the marital deduction under Section 2056(b)(7)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. (f) A trustee shall determine the internal income of each separate fund for the accounting period as if the separate fund were a trust subject to this chapter. Upon request of the surviving spouse, the trustee shall demand that the person administering the separate fund distribute the internal income to the trust. The trustee shall allocate a payment from the separate fund to income to the extent of the internal income of the separate fund and distribute that amount to the surviving spouse. The trustee shall allocate the balance of the payment to principal. Upon request of the surviving spouse, the trustee shall allocate principal to income to the extent the internal income of the separate fund exceeds payments made from the separate fund to the trust during the accounting period. (g) If a trustee cannot determine the internal income of a separate fund but can determine the value of the separate fund, the internal income of the separate fund is deemed to equal four percent of the fund's value, according to the most recent statement of value preceding the beginning of the accounting period. If the trustee can determine neither the internal income of the separate fund nor the fund's value, the internal income of the fund is deemed to equal the product of the interest rate and the present value of the expected future payments, as determined under Section 7520 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (26 U.S.C. Section 7520), for the month preceding the accounting period for which the computation is made. (h) This section does not apply to payments a payment to which \u00a7 55-13A-410 applies. Section 36. That \u00a7 55-13A-505 be amended to read as follows: 55-13A-505. (a) A tax required to be paid by a trustee based on receipts allocated to income must be paid from income. (b) A tax required to be paid by a trustee based on receipts allocated to principal must be paid from principal, even if the tax is called an income tax by the taxing authority. (c) A tax required to be paid by a trustee on the trust's share of an entity's taxable income must be paid proportionately : (1) From income to the extent that receipts from the entity are allocated only to income; and (2) From principal to the extent that : (A) Receipts receipts from the entity are allocated only to principal; and (B) The trust's share of the entity's taxable income exceeds the total receipts described in paragraphs (1) and (2)(A) (3) Proportionately from principal and income to the extent that receipts from the entity are allocated to both income and principal; and (4) From principal to the extent that the tax exceeds the total receipts from the entity . (d) For purposes of this section, receipts allocated to principal or income must be reduced by the amount distributed to a beneficiary from principal or income for which the trust receives a deduction in calculating the tax. After applying subsections (a) through (c), the trustee shall adjust income or principal receipts to the extent that the trust's taxes are reduced because the trust receives a deduction for payments made to a beneficiary. Section 37. That \u00a7 55-13A-602 be amended to read as follows: 55-13A-602. This chapter applies to every trust or will created after July 1, 2007, except as otherwise expressly provided in the will or the terms of the trust or in this chapter.

However, such election by the trustee, the disinterested person, or the court in determining the unitrust amount shall be three percent or greater; (4) The unitrust amount for the current valuation year shall be proportionately reduced for any distributions, in whole or in part, other than distributions of the unitrust amount, and for any payments of expenses, including debts, disbursements and taxes, from the trust within a current valuation year that the trustee determines to be material and substantial, and shall be proportionately increased for the receipt, other than a receipt that represents a return on investment, of any additional property into the trust within a current valuation year; (5) In the case of a short accounting period, the trustee shall prorate the unitrust amount on a daily basis; (6) If the net fair market value of an asset held in the trust has been incorrectly determined either in a current valuation year or in a prior valuation year, the unitrust amount shall be increased in the case of an undervaluation, or be decreased in the case of an overvaluation, by an amount equal to the difference between the unitrust amount determined based on the correct valuation of the asset and the unitrust amount originally determined; (7) In determining the net fair market value of the assets held in trust, the determination may not include the value of any residential property or any tangible personal property that, as of the first business day of the current valuation year, one or more income beneficiaries of the trust have or had the right to occupy, or have or had the right to possess or control, other than in a capacity as trustee, and instead the right of occupancy or the right of possession or control shall be deemed to be the unitrust amount with respect to the residential property or the tangible personal property; or any asset specifically given to a beneficiary under the terms of the trust and the return on investment on that asset, which return on investment shall be distributed to the beneficiary. Section 40. That \u00a7 55-15-7 be repealed. 55-15-7.
