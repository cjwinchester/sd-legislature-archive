The temporary order may establish the priority of claims among employers and insurers, subject to a final determination in the appropriate forum. After a final judicial or administrative order is entered establishing the liabilities of the parties, the employer or insurers found to be liable shall be ordered to reimburse the parties that are not liable for all payments made in excess of the amounts specified in the order, including interest at the Category B rate specified in \u00a7 54-3-16, regardless of the type or amount of any settlement. If the employer pays more for medical costs than is required by \u00a7 62-7-8, the medical provider shall reimburse the employer for the excess. The Department of Labor may promulgate rules pursuant to chapter 1-26 to implement this section. BILL HISTORY 1/28/97 First read in Senate and referred to Commerce.
