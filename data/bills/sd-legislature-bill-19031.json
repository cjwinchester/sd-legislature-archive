BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That chapter 49-34A be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: If a municipality elects to establish a municipal electric system and acquire by the exercise of eminent domain the electric distribution properties of the public utility currently serving all or a part of the municipality, whether or not located within the municipal boundary, and the public utility's rights to serve within the municipality, the municipality shall pay as just compensation to the public utility not less than a cash consideration consisting of the present- day reproduction cost, new, of the facilities being acquired, less depreciation computed on a straight-line basis; plus an amount equal to the cost on a nonbetterment basis of constructing any necessary facilities to reintegrate the system of the public utility outside the municipality after detaching the portion to be sold; plus as compensation for service rights, an annual amount, payable each year for a period of seven years, equal to the sum of twenty-five percent of the gross revenues received from power sales to consumers of electric power within the acquired service area, during said seven-year period. Gross revenues received shall be determined by applying the rate in effect by the public utility whose territory is being purchased at the time of acquisition. Section 2. That chapter 49-34A be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Any municipality electing to acquire the electric distribution properties of a public utility as provided in this Act shall also acquire and pay just compensation for all other properties necessarily associated with the business of the public utility in the municipality which would otherwise become stranded investments, whether or not within the municipality, at the time of acquisition based on not less than the present-day reproduction cost, new, of the facilities being acquired, less depreciation computed on a straight-line basis. Section 3. That chapter 49-34A be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: If a municipality has elected to acquire by the exercise of eminent domain the electric distribution properties of a public utility, either party may petition the commission to determine just compensation or any other term or condition necessary to complete the acquisition under the standards established by section 1 of this Act, provided the petition is filed with the commission within thirty days of the final effective date of the municipality's resolution of taking related to the public utility's distribution properties and associated properties. Within sixty days from the date of the petition, the public utility may demand a hearing before the commission on the municipality's right-to-take, and a written waiver or a failure to make demand constitutes a waiver of the right to question the necessity of the taking. Following the right-to-take hearing, or its waiver, the commission shall act only after such discovery by the parties as may be necessary and hearing upon reasonable notice. The commission shall enter an order as its final decision, which is subject to contested case review. Section 4. That chapter 49-34A be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Nothing in this Act prevents a public utility from exercising its right to a jury trial on the question of just compensation as provided in S.D. Const., Art. VI, \u00a7 13 and Art. XVII, \u00a7 12. The question of just compensation shall be decided as provided in chapter 21-35 if the public utility files an election to so proceed with the clerk of courts of the county in which any part of the municipality is located within sixty days of the final effective date of the municipality's resolution of taking related to the public utility's electric distribution properties and associated properties. In all actions governed by this section, the public utility's compensation shall not be less than that provided by the formula for just compensation established in section 1 of this Act."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 19031, "action_date": "2004-01-22T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 99662, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/99662.pdf", "status_text": "First read in Senate and referred to", "journal_page": 106, "committee_id_action": 832, "committee_id_assigned": 814, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 19031, "action_date": "2004-02-04T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 100600, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/100600.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 814, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 19031, "action_date": "2004-02-06T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 100776, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/100776.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 814, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 19031, "action_date": "2004-02-09T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 100943, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/100943.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 814, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 19031, "action_date": "2004-02-09T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 100943, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/100943.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to 36th legislative day", "journal_page": 400, "committee_id_action": 814, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 57276, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [3093], "Yea": [3101, 3109, 3120, 3137, 3139, 3146, 3065, 3050]}}, {"bill_id": 19031, "action_date": "2004-02-09T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 100943, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/100943.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to 36th legislative day", "journal_page": 400, "committee_id_action": 814, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 57276, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [3093], "Yea": [3101, 3109, 3120, 3137, 3139, 3146, 3065, 3050]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/19031"}
