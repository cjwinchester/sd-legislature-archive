That chapter 34-23A be amended by adding a NEW SECTION to read: The Legislature finds that: (1) The state has a compelling state interest in protecting the lives of unborn children from the stage at which substantial medical evidence indicates that they are capable of feeling pain; (2) There is substantial medical evidence that an unborn child is capable of experiencing pain by twenty weeks after fertilization. Section 2. That chapter 34-23A be amended by adding a NEW SECTION to read: Terms used in this Act mean: (1) \"Post-fertilization age,\" the age of an unborn child as calculated from the fusion of a human spermatozoon with a human ovum; (2) \"Probable post-fertilization age of the unborn child,\" what, in reasonable medical judgment, will with reasonable probability be the post-fertilization age of the unborn child at the time the abortion is planned to be performed or induced; (3) \"Reasonable medical judgment,\" a medical judgment that would be made by a reasonably prudent physician, knowledgeable about the case and the treatment possibilities with respect to the medical conditions involved; (4) \"Serious health risk to the unborn child's mother,\" a physician's reasonable medical judgment that the mother of an unborn child has a medical condition that so complicates her health that it necessitates the immediate abortion of her pregnancy to avert her death or to avert serious risk of substantial and irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily function, not including a psychological or emotional condition. No greater risk may be determined to exist if it is based on a claim or diagnosis that the woman will engage in conduct which she intends to result in her death or in substantial and irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily function; (5) \"Woman,\" a female human being whether or not she has reached the age of majority. Section 3. That chapter 34-23A be amended by adding a NEW SECTION to read: It is a Class 6 felony to intentionally or recklessly perform, or attempt to perform, an abortion unless the physician performing or attempting to perform the abortion first makes a determination of the probable post-fertilization age of the unborn child, or relies on another physician's determination of the probable post fertilization age of the unborn child. No penalty may be assessed against the woman upon whom the abortion is performed, or attempted to be performed. Section 4. That chapter 34-23A be amended by adding a NEW SECTION to read: For purposes of this Act, an unborn child is capable of feeling pain when the physician performing, or attempting to perform, the abortion or another physician upon whose determination that physician relies, determines that the probable post-fertilization age of the unborn child is twenty or more weeks. In determining the post-fertilization age of the unborn child, the physician shall make inquiries of the pregnant woman and perform medical examinations and tests that a reasonably prudent physician would perform to accurately diagnose the post-fertilization age of an unborn child.

No serious health risk may be deemed an exception if based on a claim or diagnosis that the woman will engage in conduct which she intends to result in her death or in substantial and irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily function. Section 6. That chapter 34-23A be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: When an abortion of an unborn child capable of feeling pain is necessary to prevent serious health risk to the unborn child's mother, the physician shall abort the pregnancy in the manner which, in reasonable medical judgment, provides the best opportunity for the unborn child to survive, unless, in reasonable medical judgment, aborting the pregnancy in that manner would pose a greater risk either of the death of the pregnant woman or of the substantial and irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily function, not including a psychological or emotional condition, of the woman than would other available methods. No greater risk may be determined to exist if it is based on a claim or diagnosis that the woman will engage in conduct which she intends to result in her death or in substantial and irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily function.
