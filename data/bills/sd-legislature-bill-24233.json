Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of South Dakota: Section 1. That \u00a7 31-26-25 be AMENDED: 31-26-25. Any person desiring to construct or lay a water pipeline over, across, or under public highways, except state trunk system highways, for the purpose of providing rural water service, or providing water to livestock on property that is taxed as agricultural land in the State of South Dakota shall, must make application to the board of county commissioners as is provided in this chapter. However, the application need not indicate the point or points to which the water pipeline is to be constructed nor the route thereof. Upon application, the board of county commissioners may grant countywide authorization for the construction of rural water service lines or lines that water livestock, subject to the provisions of this chapter. The board of county commissioners may enact ordinances governing pipelines and grant authorization to the highway superintendent to approve rural water service lines without application to the board. County approval of a pipeline authorized under this section creates no ownership interest and is a temporary grant to utilize the highway. Section 2. That \u00a7 31-26-26 be AMENDED: 31-26-26. When any highway along or under which a rural water pipeline a pipeline approved pursuant to \u00a7 31-26-25 has been constructed shall beis changed, removal, or relocation of such the pipeline shallis not be necessary if the owner or beneficiary of suchthe pipeline and the board of county commissioners shall agree in writing that such removal or relocation is not necessary. However, removal or relocation of a livestock pipeline is required if the board determines it is necessary to improve the highway or otherwise remove the pipeline for any county purpose. Section 3. That chapter 31-26 be amended with a NEW SECTION: An owner or operator of a livestock pipeline approved pursuant to \u00a7 31-26-25 may, at any time, submit a request for the relocation, removal, or change of a livestock pipeline to the highway superintendent. Upon approval of the highway superintendent, the owner or operator may, at their own cost and in accordance with any conditions set by the highway superintendent, relocate, remove, or change the livestock pipeline. Section 4. That chapter 31-26 be amended with a NEW SECTION: Nothing contained in \u00a7 31-26-25 or 31-26-26 may be construed to exempt from liability a person who owns, operates, or benefits from a livestock pipeline, for any damage or injury sustained by reason of the faulty or negligent construction or maintenance of a livestock pipeline. A county is entitled to recover, from any owner, operator, or beneficiary of a livestock pipeline, the amount necessary to spend in the removal or repair of the portion of highway or right of way impacted by the faulty or negligent construction or maintenance, including a reasonable amount for attorney's fees. The action may be commenced in any court in the county having jurisdiction."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 24233, "action_date": "2023-01-26T13:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 246354, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/246354.pdf", "status_text": "First read in Senate and referred to", "journal_page": 123, "committee_id_action": 1183, "committee_id_assigned": 1171, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 24233, "action_date": "2023-02-02T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 247766, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/247766.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 1, "committee_id_action": 1171, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 24233, "action_date": "2023-02-02T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 247768, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/247768.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass", "journal_page": 12, "committee_id_action": 1171, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 76692, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [4381, 4466, 4460, 4395, 4448, 4399], "Excused": [4426]}}, {"bill_id": 24233, "action_date": "2023-02-02T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 247768, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/247768.pdf", "status_text": "Certified uncontested, placed on consent", "journal_page": 13, "committee_id_action": 1171, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 24233, "action_date": "2023-02-03T13:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 248357, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/248357.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass", "journal_page": 192, "committee_id_action": 1183, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 76777, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [4336, 4338, 4339, 4340, 4342, 4345, 4348, 4448, 4352, 4355, 4359, 4457, 4372, 4378, 4381, 4382, 4453, 4466, 4386, 4460, 4394, 4395, 4399, 4404, 4407, 4410, 4413, 4414, 4419, 4426, 4430, 4432, 4434, 4436], "Absent": [4360]}}, {"bill_id": 24233, "action_date": "2023-02-06T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 248518, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/248518.pdf", "status_text": "First Reading House", "journal_page": 232, "committee_id_action": 1159, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 24233, "action_date": "2023-02-07T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 248719, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/248719.pdf", "status_text": "Referred to", "journal_page": 249, "committee_id_action": 1159, "committee_id_assigned": 1153, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 24233, "action_date": "2023-02-16T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 249207, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/249207.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 1153, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}]}
