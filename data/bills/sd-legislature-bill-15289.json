Section 2.

The insurer may adjust claims based in whole or in part upon the paintless dent repair method if: (1) The damage is such that the paintless dent repair method is likely to place the damaged area or a portion thereof in substantially the same condition as prior to the damage; (2) A properly licensed paintless dent repair shop is willing to perform the work as estimated within a reasonable time frame in the local market area of the insured or claimant; and (3) The written estimate provided to the insured or claimant prominently discloses the following: (a) That the repair estimate is based in whole or in part upon the paintless dent repair method.

If the insured or claimant chooses either of these options, the insurer is liable only for the cost of the paintless dent repair method. If, for any portion of the vehicle's damage that the insurer has a duty to repair, the paintless dent repair method is inappropriate or actually produces an inadequate result, the insurer shall compensate the insured or claimant for the amount necessary to complete the repairs in the local market area of the insured or claimant.
