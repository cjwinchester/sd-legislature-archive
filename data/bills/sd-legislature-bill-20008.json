Section 23. The authority may issue revenue bonds, notes, or other evidences of indebtedness to pay the cost incurred in connection with developing, constructing, acquiring, improving, maintaining, operating, and decommissioning electric transmission facilities.

All such revenue bonds, notes, or other instruments shall be payable solely from the revenues or income to be derived with respect to such facilities, from the leasing or sale of such facilities, or from any other funds available to the authority for such purposes. The revenue bonds, notes, or other instruments may bear such date or dates, may mature at such time or times not exceeding forty years from their respective dates, may bear interest at such rate or rates, may be in such form, may carry such registration privileges, may be executed in such manner, may be payable at such place or places, may be made subject to redemption in such manner and upon such terms, with or without premium as is stated on the face thereof, may be authenticated in such manner, and may contain such terms and covenants as may be provided by an applicable resolution.

If the authority fails to pay the principal of or interest on any of the revenue bonds or premium, if any, as the same become due, a civil action to compel payment may be instituted in the appropriate circuit court by the holder or holders of the revenue bonds on which such default of payment exists or by an indenture trustee acting on behalf of such holders. Delivery of a summons and a copy of the complaint to the chair of the board constitutes sufficient service to give the circuit court jurisdiction of the subject matter of such a suit and jurisdiction over the authority and its officers named as defendants for the purpose of compelling such payment. Section 26. Notwithstanding the form and tenor of any such revenue bonds, notes, or other instruments and in the absence of any express recital on the face of any such revenue bond, note, or other instruments that it is non-negotiable, all such revenue bonds, notes, and other instruments shall be negotiable instruments.

Section 28. The revenue bonds or notes shall be secured as provided in the authorizing resolution which may, notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, include in addition to any other security a specific pledge or assignment of and lien on or security interest in any or all revenues or money of the authority from whatever source which may by law be used for debt service purposes and a specific pledge or assignment of and lien on or security interest in any funds or accounts established or provided for by resolution of the authority authorizing the issuance of such revenue bonds, notes, or other instruments. Any pledge made by the authority of revenues or other moneys received or to be received by the authority pursuant to an agreement with a governmental agency relating to a project to pay revenue bonds, notes, or other evidences of indebtedness of the authority shall be binding from the time the pledge is made. Revenues and other moneys received or to be received by the authority pursuant to an agreement with a governmental agency relating to a project so pledged to pay revenue bonds, notes, or other evidences of indebtedness of the authority shall be held outside of the state treasury and in the custody of the authority or a trustee or a depository appointed by the authority. Revenues or other moneys received or to be received by the authority pursuant to an agreement with a governmental agency relating to a project so pledged to pay revenue bonds, notes, or other evidences of indebtedness of the authority and thereafter received by the authority or such trustee or depository shall immediately be subject to the lien of the pledge without any physical delivery thereof or further act, and the lien of any pledge shall be binding against all parties having claims of any kind of tort, contract, or otherwise against the authority or the State of South Dakota, irrespective of whether the parties have notice thereof.

Nothing in this Act may be construed to authorize the authority to create a debt of the state within the meaning of the Constitution or statutes of South Dakota and all revenue bonds, notes, other instruments and obligations issued by the authority pursuant to the provisions of this Act are payable and shall state that they are payable solely from the funds pledged for their payment in accordance with the resolution authorizing their issuance or in any trust indenture or mortgage or deed of trust executed as security therefor. The state is not in any event liable for the payment of the principal of or interest on any bonds, notes, instruments, or obligations issued by the authority or for the performance of any pledge, mortgage, obligation, or agreement of any kind whatsoever which may be undertaken by the authority.

Section 20. The authority may issue revenue bonds, notes, or other evidences of indebtedness to pay the cost incurred in connection with developing, constructing, acquiring, improving, maintaining, operating, and decommissioning electric transmission facilities. For the purpose of evidencing the obligations of the authority to repay any money borrowed, the authority may, pursuant to resolution, from time to time issue and dispose of its interest bearing revenue bonds, notes, or other instruments and may also from time to time issue and dispose of such bonds, notes, or other instruments to refund, at maturity, at a redemption date or in advance of either, any revenue bonds, notes, or other instruments pursuant to redemption provisions or at any time before maturity. All such revenue bonds, notes, or other instruments shall be payable solely from the revenues or income to be derived with respect to such facilities, from the leasing or sale of such facilities, or from any other funds available to the authority for such purposes. The revenue bonds, notes, or other instruments may bear such date or dates, may mature at such time or times not exceeding forty years from their respective dates, may bear interest at such rate or rates, may be in such form, may carry such registration privileges, may be executed in such manner, may be payable at such place or places, may be made subject to redemption in such manner and upon such terms, with or without premium as is stated on the face thereof, may be authenticated in such manner, and may contain such terms and covenants as may be provided by an applicable resolution. Section 21. Any holder of any revenue bonds, notes, or other instruments issued by the authority may bring suits at law or proceedings in equity to compel the performance and observance by any corporation or person or by the authority or any of its agents or employees of any contract or covenant made with the holders of such revenue bonds, notes, or other instruments, to compel such corporation, person, the authority, and any of its agents or employees to perform any duties required to be performed for the benefit of the holders of any such revenue bonds, notes, or other instruments by the provision of the resolution authorizing their issuance and to enjoin such corporation, person, the authority, and any of its agents or employees from taking any action in conflict with any such contract or covenant. Section 22. If the authority fails to pay the principal of or interest on any of the revenue bonds or premium, if any, as the same become due, a civil action to compel payment may be instituted in the appropriate circuit court by the holder or holders of the revenue bonds on which such default of payment exists or by an indenture trustee acting on behalf of such holders. Delivery of a summons and a copy of the complaint to the chair of the board constitutes sufficient service to give the circuit court jurisdiction of the subject matter of such a suit and jurisdiction over the authority and its officers named as defendants for the purpose of compelling such payment. Section 23. Notwithstanding the form and tenor of any such revenue bonds, notes, or other instruments and in the absence of any express recital on the face of any such revenue bond, note, or other instruments that it is non-negotiable, all such revenue bonds, notes, and other instruments shall be negotiable instruments. Pending the preparation and execution of any such revenue bonds, notes, or other instruments, temporary revenue bonds, notes, or instruments may be issued as provided by resolution. Section 24. To secure the payment of any or all of such revenue bonds, notes, or other instruments, the revenues to be received by the authority from a lease agreement or loan agreement shall be pledged, and, for the purpose of setting forth the covenants and undertakings of the authority in connection with the issuance thereof and the issuance of any additional revenue bonds, notes, or other instruments payable from such revenues, income, or other funds to be derived from electric transmission facilities, the authority may execute and deliver a trust agreement. A remedy for any breach or default of the terms of any such trust agreement by the authority may be by mandamus proceedings in the appropriate circuit court to compel the performance and compliance therewith, but the trust agreement may prescribe by whom or on whose behalf the action may be instituted. Section 25. The revenue bonds or notes shall be secured as provided in the authorizing resolution which may, notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, include in addition to any other security a specific pledge or assignment of and lien on or security interest in any or all revenues or money of the authority from whatever source which may by law be used for debt service purposes and a specific pledge or assignment of and lien on or security interest in any funds or accounts established or provided for by resolution of the authority authorizing the issuance of such revenue bonds, notes, or other instruments. Any pledge made by the authority of revenues or other moneys received or to be received by the authority pursuant to an agreement with a governmental agency relating to a project to pay revenue bonds, notes, or other evidences of indebtedness of the authority shall be binding from the time the pledge is made. Revenues and other moneys received or to be received by the authority pursuant to an agreement with a governmental agency relating to a project so pledged to pay revenue bonds, notes, or other evidences of indebtedness of the authority shall be held outside of the state treasury and in the custody of the authority or a trustee or a depository appointed by the authority. Revenues or other moneys received or to be received by the authority pursuant to an agreement with a governmental agency relating to a project so pledged to pay revenue bonds, notes, or other evidences of indebtedness of the authority and thereafter received by the authority or such trustee or depository shall immediately be subject to the lien of the pledge without any physical delivery thereof or further act, and the lien of any pledge shall be binding against all parties having claims of any kind of tort, contract, or otherwise against the authority or the State of South Dakota, irrespective of whether the parties have notice thereof. Neither the resolution nor any other instrument by which a pledge is created need be filed or recorded except in the records of the authority. Section 26. The State of South Dakota pledges to and agrees with the holders of the revenue bonds and notes of the authority issued pursuant to this Act that the state will not limit or decrease the rights and powers vested in the authority by this Act so as to impair the terms of any contract made by the authority with such holders or in any way impair the rights and remedies of such holders until such revenue bonds, notes, or other instruments, together with interest thereon, with interest on any unpaid installments of interest, and all costs and expenses in connection with any action or proceedings by or on behalf of such holders, are fully met and discharged. The authority may include these pledges and agreements of the state in any contract with the holders of revenue bonds, notes, or other instruments issued pursuant to this section. Section 27. Nothing in this Act may be construed to authorize the authority to create a debt of the state within the meaning of the Constitution or statutes of South Dakota and all revenue bonds, notes, other instruments and obligations issued by the authority pursuant to the provisions of this Act are payable and shall state that they are payable solely from the funds pledged for their payment in accordance with the resolution authorizing their issuance or in any trust indenture or mortgage or deed of trust executed as security therefor. The state is not in any event liable for the payment of the principal of or interest on any bonds, notes, instruments, or obligations issued by the authority or for the performance of any pledge, mortgage, obligation, or agreement of any kind whatsoever which may be undertaken by the authority. No breach of any such pledge, mortgage, obligation, or agreement may impose any pecuniary liability upon the state or any charge upon its general credit or against its taxing power. Section 28. The state and all counties, municipalities, political subdivisions, public bodies, public officers, banks, bankers, trust companies, savings banks and institutions, building and loan associations, savings and loan associations, personal representatives, conservators, trustees, and other fiduciaries may legally invest any debt service funds, money, or other funds belonging to them or within their control in any bonds or notes issued pursuant to this Act.

The authority may acquire, develop, construct, improve, maintain, operate, and decommission any electric transmission facilities, either under its own direction or through collaboration with any approved applicant, or to acquire any project through purchase or otherwise, using for that purpose the proceeds derived from its sale of revenue bonds, notes, or other instruments or governmental loans, grants, or other funds and to hold title to those projects in the name of the authority. Section 33. The authority may enter into intergovernmental agreements with any governmental agency. Section 34. The authority may share employees with governmental agencies. Section 35.

Those depositories shall be designated only within the state and upon condition that bonds approved as to form and surety by the authority and at least equal in amount to the maximum sum expected to be on deposit at any one time shall be first given by the depositories to the authority, those bonds to be conditioned for the safekeeping and prompt repayment of the deposits. If any of the funds of the authority are deposited by the treasurer in any such depository, the treasurer and the sureties on the treasurer's official bond are, to that extent, exempt from liability for the loss of any of the deposited funds by reason of the failure, bankruptcy, or any other act or default of the depository.
