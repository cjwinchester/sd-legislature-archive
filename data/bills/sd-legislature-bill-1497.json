WHEREAS, Congress has not yet enacted legislation providing for a multi-year reauthorization of the federal highway program, hampering the ability of our state to plan and deliver needed surface transportation improvements to the citizens of South Dakota; and WHEREAS, South Dakota serves as a bridge for truck and personal traffic between other states, advancing interstate commerce and mobility; and WHEREAS, South Dakota's transportation system supports agricultural exports and serves the nation's domestic energy industries like wind generation and ethanol production, located largely in rural areas; and WHEREAS, South Dakota's surface transportation system serves as a lifeline for remotely located and economically challenged citizens, such as those living on tribal reservations; and WHEREAS, South Dakota's transportation system enables people and business to traverse the vast acres of sparsely populated land that is characteristic of the western United States; and WHEREAS, South Dakota's transportation system provides access to the scenic wonders of Badlands National Park and of Mt. Rushmore and provides a major connection to national parks in other states; and WHEREAS, South Dakota has a vast and extensive highway system that serves national as well as state transportation needs, has very few citizens to finance the highway system's maintenance and improvement, and has one of the highest per capita levels of effort in funding transportation in the nation; and WHEREAS, because of all the factors listed above, it is essential that South Dakota's transportation system receive a proportion of the national funding equivalent to what it has received in the SAFETEA-LU reauthorization of the federal highway program to keep the state and the nation connected: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the House of Representatives of the Eighty-fifth Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the Senate concurring therein, that the South Dakota Legislature strongly supports prompt enactment of a well-funded, multi-year federal surface transportation program that includes a highway funding formula share that is at least as favorable to South Dakota as the current formula in SAFETEA-LU; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that a copy of this resolution be sent to the Majority Leader and Minority Leader of the United States Senate, the President of the United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, the Chairman of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, the Chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, and to each member of South Dakota's congressional delegation."}, {"bill_id": 1497, "bill_version_id": 10675, "bill_version": "Enrolled", "bill_version_date": "2010-01-20T09:06:36.487-06:00", "bill_text": ""}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 1497, "action_date": "2010-01-12T12:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 10420, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/10420.pdf", "status_text": "First Reading", "journal_page": 14, "committee_id_action": 86, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 1497, "action_date": "2010-01-13T13:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 10454, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/10454.pdf", "status_text": "Adopt Resolution", "journal_page": 38, "committee_id_action": 86, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 5446, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [821, 825, 771, 793, 781, 775, 844, 831, 820, 804, 779, 740, 813, 756, 748, 817, 814, 765, 811, 830, 798, 749, 829, 832, 826, 757, 842, 777, 803, 822, 843, 759, 816, 824, 788, 800, 801, 827, 750, 742, 770, 792, 783, 755, 751, 773, 744, 840, 784, 839, 819, 836, 841, 818, 815, 833, 762, 746, 763, 752, 796, 828, 823, 789, 838, 837, 812, 786], "Excused": [835, 834]}}, {"bill_id": 1497, "action_date": "2010-01-14T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 10503, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/10503.pdf", "status_text": "First Reading", "journal_page": 51, "committee_id_action": 84, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 1497, "action_date": "2010-01-19T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 10647, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/10647.pdf", "status_text": "Concurred in Resolution", "journal_page": 79, "committee_id_action": 84, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 5519, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [758, 809, 785, 787, 790, 807, 754, 805, 760, 778, 782, 780, 739, 802, 764, 795, 741, 772, 761, 766, 791, 806, 767, 808, 769, 743, 753, 745, 794, 799, 810, 747, 776], "Excused": [768, 774]}}]}
