BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That chapter 31-29 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: The Department of Transportation may not deny a permit for a sign, display, or device for outdoor advertising purposes that is to be legally erected and maintained pursuant to this chapter to any applicant who has met all state and local government requirements for the issuance of the permit. The department may not deny a permit based on the department's assessment that a zoning action made by a local government unit was taken primarily to permit outdoor advertising structures or that the action was not part of a comprehensive zoning action. The department may not deny a permit based on the department's assessment that an official action made by a local government unit was defective, unless the matter has been decided by appropriate legal action in the circuit court. 170 copies were printed on recycled paper by the South Dakota Legislative Research Council at a cost of $.098 per page. .
