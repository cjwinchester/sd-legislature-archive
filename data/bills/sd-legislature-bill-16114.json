BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 13-32-9 be amended to read as follows: 13-32-9. Any person adjudicated, convicted, or the subject of a suspended imposition of sentence for possession, use, or distribution of controlled substances or marijuana as defined in chapter 22-42 is ineligible to participate in any extracurricular activity at any secondary school accredited by the Department of Education and Cultural Affairs for one year. However, the one- year suspension may be reduced to sixty calendar days if the person participates in an assessment with a certified chemical dependency counselor or completes an accredited intensive prevention program. If the assessment indicates the need for a higher level of care, the student is required to complete the prescribed program before becoming eligible to participate in extracurricular activities. Upon a subsequent adjudication, conviction, or suspended imposition of sentence for possession, use, or distribution of controlled substances or marijuana by a court of competent jurisdiction, that person is ineligible to participate in any extracurricular activity while that person is attending any school accredited by the Department of Education and Cultural Affairs. However, the permanent suspension may be reduced to one hundred twenty calendar days if the person participates in a complete alcohol, tobacco, and other drug assessment with a certified chemical dependency counselor and completes a minimum of sixty hours of counseling with a certified chemical dependency counselor or completes an accredited treatment program. The student is required to complete any prescribed program before becoming eligible to participate in extracurricular activities. Upon such a determination in any juvenile proceeding that a person has been adjudicated, convicted, or received a suspended imposition of sentence for possession, use, or distribution of a controlled substance, the Unified Judicial System shall give notice of that determination to the South Dakota High School Activities Association and the chief administrator of the school in which the person is enrolled. As used in this section, the term, extracurricular activity, means any activity sanctioned by the South Dakota High School Activities Association."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 16114, "action_date": "2001-01-24T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 88432, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/88432.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 172, "committee_id_action": 712, "committee_id_assigned": 707, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 16114, "action_date": "2001-01-31T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 89058, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/89058.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 707, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 16114, "action_date": "2001-01-31T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 89058, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/89058.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to 41st legislative day", "journal_page": 282, "committee_id_action": 707, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 50984, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [2526, 2548, 2554, 2563, 2591], "Excused": [2537], "Yea": [2538, 2540, 2565, 2582, 2604, 2588, 2593]}}, {"bill_id": 16114, "action_date": "2001-01-31T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 89058, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/89058.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to 41st legislative day", "journal_page": 282, "committee_id_action": 707, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 50984, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [2526, 2548, 2554, 2563, 2591], "Excused": [2537], "Yea": [2538, 2540, 2565, 2582, 2604, 2588, 2593]}}]}
