If a child is residing in a state institution, approved group home, or private child-care center which provides care and custody for children who are not living with their parents or guardian, the school residence of the child is the school district where the parents or guardian reside, subject to the provisions of \u00a7 13-28-9. The school district where a group home or private child-care center is located is responsible for providing an educational program for the children who reside in the group home or private child-care center. Tuition is the responsibility of the school district where the child has school residence, only if assignment to the agency is made with the knowledge of the school district where the child has school residence only if the child was placed at the group home or private child-care center by the school district where the child has school residence. If the child was placed at the group home or private child-care center by the parent or guardian, the school district where the child has school residence shall pay tuition to the school district where the group home or private child-care center is located only if the placement of the child to the group home or private child-care center was made with the prior knowledge of and written notice to the school district where the child has school residence. Tuition is the amount equal to the daily amount of state aid attributable to the child that is received by the school district where the student has school residence."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 2102, "action_date": "2010-02-03T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 11788, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/11788.pdf", "status_text": "First read in Senate and referred to", "journal_page": 229, "committee_id_action": 84, "committee_id_assigned": 62, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 2102, "action_date": "2010-02-09T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 11840, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/11840.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 62, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 2102, "action_date": "2010-02-09T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 11940, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/11940.pdf", "status_text": "Motion to amend", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 62, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 2102, "action_date": "2010-02-11T08:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 11948, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/11948.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 62, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 2102, "action_date": "2010-02-11T08:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 12101, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/12101.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to the 41st legislative day", "journal_page": 290, "committee_id_action": 62, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 6356, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [782, 769, 753, 745, 766, 778], "Nay": [761]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/2102"}
