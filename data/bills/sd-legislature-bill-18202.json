BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 58-15-74 be amended to read as follows: 58-15-74. The minimum values as specified in \u00a7 \u00a7 58-15-75 to 58-15-80, inclusive, of any paid-up annuity, cash surrender , or death benefits available under an annuity contract shall be based upon minimum nonforfeiture amounts as defined in this section: (1) With respect to contracts providing for flexible considerations, the minimum nonforfeiture amount at any time at or prior to the commencement of any annuity payments shall be equal to an accumulation up to such time at a rate of interest of three percent per annum of percentages of the net considerations, as hereinafter defined, paid prior to such time, decreased by the sum of any prior withdrawals from or partial surrenders of the contract accumulated at a rate of interest of three percent per annum and the amount of any indebtedness to the company on the contract, including interest due and accrued, and increased by any existing additional amounts credited by the company to the contract; (2) The net considerations for a given contract year used to define the minimum nonforfeiture amount shall be an amount not less than zero and shall be equal to the corresponding gross considerations credited to the contract during that contract year less an annual contract charge of thirty dollars and less a collection charge of one dollar and twenty-five cents per consideration credited to the contract during that contract year and the percentages of net considerations shall be sixty-five percent of the net consideration for the first contract year and eighty-seven and one-half percent of the net considerations for the second and later contract years. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions, the percentage shall be sixty-five percent of the portion of the total net consideration for any renewal contract year which exceeds by not more than two times the sum of those portions of the net considerations in all prior contract years for which the percentage was sixty-five percent; and (3) With respect to contracts providing for fixed scheduled considerations, minimum nonforfeiture amounts shall be calculated on the assumption that considerations are paid annually in advance and shall be defined as for contracts with flexible considerations which are paid annually with two exceptions: (a) The portion of the net consideration for the first contract year to be accumulated shall be the sum of sixty-five percent of the net consideration for the first contract year plus twenty-two and one-half percent of the excess of the net consideration for the first contract year over the lesser of the net considerations for the second and third contract years; and (b) The annual contract charge shall be the lesser of thirty dollars or ten percent of the gross annual consideration; (4) With respect to contracts providing for a single consideration, minimum nonforfeiture amounts shall be defined as for contracts with flexible considerations except that the percentage of net consideration used to determine the minimum nonforfeiture amount shall be equal to ninety percent and the net consideration shall be the gross consideration less a contract charge of seventy-five dollars ; (5) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, for any contract issued after June 30, 2003, and before July 1, 2005, the interest rate at which net considerations, withdrawals, and partial surrenders shall be accumulated, for purposes of determining minimum nonforfeiture amounts, shall be one and one-half percent per annum ."}, {"bill_id": 18202, "bill_version_id": 98443, "bill_version": "Enrolled", "bill_version_date":
