Section 2. The secretary of the Department of Revenue may issue a cider license to a cider maker located within the state and producing ciders as defined in this Act.

Except as otherwise specified in this Act, the provisions of title 35 apply to the production, sale, possession, and consumption of cider. Section 4. The holder of a cider license may manufacture cider in the state from South Dakota produced or grown fruit, as listed in subdivision 35-1-1(3A). If South Dakota produced or grown fruit as listed in subdivision 35-1-1(3A) is not available in quantities sufficient to constitute a majority of the cider produced by a cider maker, the holder of the cider license may file an affidavit with the secretary of the Department of Revenue stating this fact and requesting that the secretary approve the use of imported products by the cider maker. If the secretary approves, the cider maker may use imported products and shall continue to be governed by the provisions of this Act. The secretary's approval is effective for a period of one year, after which the cider maker shall use South Dakota produced or grown fruit as listed in subdivision 35-1-1(3A) unless the cider license holder files a new affidavit and request with the secretary and the secretary approves the request.
