The applicant shall pay a ten dollar fee for each set of special license plates and pay an annual ten dollar fee for each set of renewal stickers thereafter. No registration fee or sticker fee may be charged to the applicant pursuant to \u00a7 32-5- 6. The special plates shall be numbered consecutively beginning with number 1 and contain a symbol to be determined by the secretary indicating that the owner has received the Purple Heart Medal. The special plates shall be displayed as set forth in \u00a7 32-5-98. The special license plate shall be reflectorized and validated each year with a sticker in the same manner as a noncommercial license plate.
