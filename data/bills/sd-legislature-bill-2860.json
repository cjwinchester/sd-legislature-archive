BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. The Legislature finds that: (1) The enforcement of surrogacy agreements and contracts is contrary to the best interests of children, to the State policy that custody of children should be determined based upon the best interests of the children, that such arrangements are exploitive of women, that such arrangements are contrary to a mother's interest in her relationship with her child, and contrary to the State's interest in protecting the relationship between a mother and her child; and (2) That surrogacy arrangements and contracts, whether written or oral, are in direct conflict with numerous public policies of the State of South Dakota, including: the State's policy prohibiting offers of money or payment of money in connection with an adoption; the State's policy against trafficking in children; the State's policy that no surrender of a mother's parental rights or waiver of her constitutional right to her relationship with her child will be enforced if made prior to the birth of her child; and (3) That surrogacy agreements and contracts are in direct conflict with, and are designed to terminate and destroy, the mother's parental rights, her relationship with her child, and her fundamental liberty and interest in that relationship, contrary to the established public policy and laws of the State of South Dakota. Section 2. Terms used in this Act mean: (1) \"Surrogacy,\" an arrangement, whether or not embodied in a contract, written or oral, entered into by two or more persons, including the mother, sometimes referred to as the \"surrogate\" or \"gestational carrier\" or \"surrogate uterus\", and an intended rearing parent or parents, who agree, prior to insemination, or in the case of an implanted embryo, prior to embryo transfer or embryo implantation, to participate in the creation of a child, with the intention that the child will be reared as the child of one or more of the intended parents, other than the mother; (2) \"Commercial surrogacy,\" a surrogacy arrangement involving the payment, or agreement to pay, money or any valuable consideration to a broker/intermediary, or the payment, or agreement to pay, money or any valuable consideration (other than payment or reimbursement of medical and hospital expenses currently allowable under adoption law) to a mother; (3) \"Broker/intermediary,\" a person, or an agency, association, corporation, partnership, institution, society or organization, which knowingly seeks to introduce or to match a prospective mother with a prospective biological father, or other intended parent, for the purpose of initiating, assisting, or facilitating a surrogacy arrangement; (4) \"Intended parent,\" a person, whether male or female, whether or not genetically related to the child born as a result of a surrogacy arrangement, who is intended to be the person or one of the persons who would raise the child following birth; (5) \"Mother,\" the woman who carries and gives birth to the child, whether or not she is genetically related to the child. Section 3. No physician, licensed by the State of South Dakota, or agent or employee of such a physician shall assist in the process of insemination or embryo transfer or implantation that is in connection with, or is in any way associated with, a surrogacy arrangement. A physician or other person who knowingly or in reckless disregard violates this section is guilty of a Class 6 felony. The prosecutor who prosecutes such violation, and the court before whom the violation is brought, shall, separately and independently of each other, report such violation and conviction to the Board of Medical and Osteopathic Examiners. Section 4. Other than the mother and the intended parents, any person, agency, association, corporation, partnership, institution, society or organization, their agents and employees, which engage in, promote, profit from, solicit a woman for, or otherwise assist in, commercial surrogacy arrangements in the State of South Dakota, is guilty of a Class 5 felony. Section 5. Any person or entity who acts as a broker/intermediary in connection with a surrogacy arrangement, whether or not the person is paid or receives other consideration, is guilty of a Class 6 felony. Section 6. Any person, agency, association, corporation, partnership, institution, society or organization, and their agents and employees, who offers, gives, or receives any money or other consideration or thing of value in connection or association with a surrogacy arrangement is guilty of a Class 6 felony. Section 7. A surrogacy contract or arrangement, whether entered into in South Dakota, or in some other state, is unenforceable in South Dakota. A custody dispute concerning a child born as a result of a surrogacy arrangement shall be resolved under South Dakota law. Section 8. The mother of a child born as the result of a surrogacy arrangement has the right to primary physical custody of the child following birth. If the child is in her custody following birth, the mother shall keep the custody of the child if she so chooses, before and during the pendency of any legal action to determine custody, unless there is proof by clear and convincing evidence, that she is unfit or she poses a substantial harm to the child. If the child is not in her custody following birth, the mother may exercise her right to take custody of the child, by notifying the person or entity in whose custody the child then resides, in writing, anytime within one hundred twenty days of the date of the child's birth. Upon proof that such intention was delivered to one or more persons in whose custody the child then resides, the court shall enter an order awarding pendente lite custody to the mother. Any claim that the mother is unfit or otherwise presents a likelihood that she will harm the child can only be made after the child is placed with the mother, and all proof of such allegations shall be established by clear and convincing evidence. Section 9. At a final hearing to determine placement of the child born as a result of a surrogacy arrangement, there is a legal presumption that custody of the child should be placed with the mother. This presumption may be overcome by a demonstration, based on clear and convincing evidence, that the mother fails to meet minimal parenting standards necessary to satisfy the basic needs and welfare of the child. Such determinations may not be based on consideration of economic or social class. Section 10. The intended parent in a surrogacy arrangement which is not a commercial surrogacy arrangement and who is not in violation of the provisions of any of sections 3, 4, 5 and 6 of this Act is not guilty of a crime, but is subject to civil penalties of not less than thirty thousand dollars and not more than fifty thousand dollars for a first offense, and not less than fifty thousand dollars and not more than eighty thousand dollars for a second offense. An intended parent who is guilty of a third offense is guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor. Section 11. The intended parent or parents has a duty to provide financial support for a child born as a result of a surrogacy arrangement, whether or not the intended parent has custody of the child. There is a presumption that the noncustodial parent of the child born as a result of a surrogacy arrangement should be given parenting time or visitation, unless it is demonstrated that such visitation would be contrary to the best interests of the child. The parenting time should be liberal, based on the facts of the particular case, consistent with the child's best interests. Section 12. If a surrogacy arrangement is repudiated by either party, the mother is entitled to have all medical and hospital expenses, including prenatal care, and the medical and hospital expenses of the child incurred during child birth and for treatment for any condition of the child immediately following birth, paid for by the intended parent or parents, even though the surrogacy arrangement is unenforceable and the mother has custody of any child born as a result of the surrogacy arrangement. Section 13. If neither the intended rearing parent or parents, nor the mother are willing or able to assume custody of the child, the child shall be placed for adoption in accordance with statute. Until such time as adoption of the child is final, both the intended rearing parent or parents and the mother are obligated consistent with their respective financial abilities, to pay financial support for the child. Section 14. In disputed multi-state surrogacy arrangements within the jurisdiction of the South Dakota courts, South Dakota law applies."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 2860, "action_date": "2011-01-31T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 16039, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/16039.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 220, "committee_id_action": 115, "committee_id_assigned": 111, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 2860, "action_date": "2011-02-14T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 16561, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/16561.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 111, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 2860, "action_date": "2011-02-14T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 16810, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/16810.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to the 41st legislative day", "journal_page": 370, "committee_id_action": 111, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 8982, "president_vote": null, "Excused": [12], "Yea": [17, 15, 59, 104, 62, 67, 93, 35, 36], "Nay": [71, 103, 11]}}]}
