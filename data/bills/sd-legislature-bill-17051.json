BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. No person or entity conducting business in this state may facsimile (fax) or cause to be faxed, or electronically mail (e-mail) or cause to be e-mailed, documents consisting of unsolicited advertising material for the lease, sale, rental, gift offer, or other disposition of any realty, good, services, or extension of credit unless: (1) In the case of a fax, that person or entity establishes a toll-free number that a recipient of the unsolicited faxed documents may call to notify the sender not to fax the recipient any further unsolicited documents; (2) In the case of e-mail, that person or entity establishes a toll-free telephone number or valid sender operated return e-mail address that the recipient of the unsolicited documents may call or e-mail to notify the sender not to e-mail any further unsolicited documents. A violation of this section is a Class 2 misdemeanor. Section 2. Any unsolicited faxed or e-mailed documents subject to this Act shall include a statement informing the recipient of the toll-free telephone number that the recipient may call, or a valid return address to which the recipient may write or e-mail, as the case may be, notifying the sender not to fax or e-mail the recipient any further unsolicited documents to the fax number, or numbers, or e-mail address, or addresses, specified by the recipient. In the case of faxed material, the statement shall be in at least nine-point type. In the case of e-mail, the statement shall be the first text in the body of the message and shall be of the same size as the majority of the text of the message. A violation of this section is a Class 2 misdemeanor. Section 3. Upon notification by a recipient of his or her request not to receive any further unsolicited faxed or e-mailed documents, no person or entity conducting business in this state may fax or cause to be faxed or e-mail or cause to be e-mailed any unsolicited documents to that recipient. A violation of this section is a Class 2 misdemeanor. Section 4. In the case of e-mail, this Act applies when the unsolicited e-mailed documents are delivered to a South Dakota resident via an electronic mail service provider's service or equipment located in this state. For the purposes of this section, the term, electronic mail service provider, means any business or organization qualified to do business in this state that provides individuals, corporations, or other entities the ability to send or receive electronic mail through equipment located in this state and that is an intermediary in sending or receiving electronic mail. As used in this Act, the term, unsolicited e-mailed documents, means any e-mailed document or documents consisting of advertising material for the lease, sale, rental, gift offer, or other disposition of any realty, goods, services, or extension of credit that meet both of the following requirements: (1) The documents are addressed to a recipient with whom the initiator does not have an existing business or personal relationship; and (2) The documents are not sent at the request of, or with the express consent of, the recipient. Section 5. As used in this Act, the term, fax or cause to be faxed or e-mail or cause to be e- mailed, does not include or refer to the transmission of any documents by a telecommunications utility or internet service provider to the extent that the telecommunications utility or internet service provider merely carries that transmission over its network. Section 6. In the case of e-mail that consists of unsolicited advertising material for the lease, sale, rental, gift offer, or other disposition of any realty, goods, services, or extension of credit, the subject line of each message shall include \"ADV:\" as the first four characters. If these messages contain information that consists of unsolicited advertising material for the lease, sale, rental, gift offer, or other disposition of any realty, goods, services, or extension of credit, that may only be viewed, purchased, rented, leased, or held in possession by an individual eighteen years of age and older, the subject line of each message shall include \"ADV:ADLT\" as the first eight characters. A violation of this section is a Class 2 misdemeanor. Section 7. An employer who is the registered owner of more than one e-mail address may notify the person or entity conducting business in this state e-mailing or causing to be e-mailed, documents consisting of unsolicited advertising material for the lease, sale, rental, gift offer, or other disposition of any realty, good, services, or extension of credit of the desire to cease e- mailing on behalf of all of the employees who may use employer-provided and employer- controlled e-mail addresses. Section 8. A willful violation of this Act is an unfair or deceptive trade practice and is subject to the relief provided under chapter 37-24. Section 9. Any consumer who claims to have been adversely affected by any act or practice declared to be unlawful by this Act may bring a civil action for the recovery of twice the actual damages suffered or five hundred dollars for each occurrence, whichever is greater, as a result of a willful act or pratice. In addition, the consumer may collect the court costs and attorney fees expended by the consumer to bring an action under this section. Section 10. Any action arising under this Act in no way affects any cause of action arising under other laws of this state or under the common law, whether or not the other cause of action is included within the provisions of this Act."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 17051, "action_date": "2002-01-17T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 92321, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/92321.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 176, "committee_id_action": 768, "committee_id_assigned": 763, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 17051, "action_date": "2002-01-26T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 92945, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/92945.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 763, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 17051, "action_date": "2002-02-01T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 93426, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/93426.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 763, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 17051, "action_date": "2002-02-04T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 93547, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/93547.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 763, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 17051, "action_date": "2002-02-04T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 93547, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/93547.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass Amended,", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 763, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "F", "vote": {"vote_id": 52041, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [2736, 2764, 2775, 2803, 2816, 2805], "Yea": [2748, 2759, 2773, 2793, 2799], "Excused": [2749, 2751]}}, {"bill_id": 17051, "action_date": "2002-02-04T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 93547, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/93547.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass Amended,", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 763, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "F", "vote": {"vote_id": 52041, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [2736, 2764, 2775, 2803, 2816, 2805], "Yea": [2748, 2759, 2773, 2793, 2799], "Excused": [2749, 2751]}}, {"bill_id": 17051, "action_date": "2002-02-06T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 93802, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/93802.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to 36th legislative day", "journal_page": 490, "committee_id_action": 763, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 52277, "president_vote": null, "Excused": [2736], "Yea": [2748, 2749, 2751, 2759, 2764, 2773, 2775, 2793, 2803, 2816, 2805], "Nay": [2799]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/17051"}
