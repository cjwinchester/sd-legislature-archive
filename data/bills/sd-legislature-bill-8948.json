This definition excludes any school that receives a majority of its revenues from public funds; (8) \"Scholarship granting organization,\" a nonprofit organization that complies with the requirements of the program and provides educational scholarships to students.

If a student moves to a new qualifying school during a school year, the scholarship amount may be prorated; and (10) Report to the division by March June first of each year the following information, prepared by a certified public accountant regarding its contributions in the previous calendar year and the scholarship awards in the current fiscal year: (a) The name and address of each contributing company; (b) The total number and total dollar amount of contributions received from each company; and (c) The total number and total dollar amount of educational scholarships awarded to eligible students, the total number and total dollar amount of educational scholarships awarded to low-income eligible students, and the percentage of first-time recipients of educational scholarships who were
