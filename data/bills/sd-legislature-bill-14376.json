Nothing in this chapter limits the powers of the commission, or precludes the pursuit of any other administrative, civil, injunctive, or criminal remedies by the commission or any other person. Administrative remedies need not be exhausted in order to proceed under this chapter. The remedies provided by this chapter are in addition to those provided under existing statutory or common law. Section 5. That \u00a7 49-34B-14 be amended to read as follows: 49-34B-14. The commission may, to the extent authorized by agreement with the secretary of the United States Department of Transportation, act as agent for the secretary of transportation to implement the United States Code, title 49, section 60101 et seq. as amended to January 1, 1997 1999 , and any federal pipeline safety regulations promulgated thereto with respect to interstate gas pipelines located within this state, as necessary to obtain annual federal certification.

The commission may seek and accept federal designation of the commission's pipeline inspectors as federal agents for the purposes of inspection pursuant to the United States Code, title 49, section 60101 et seq. as amended to January 1, 1997 1999 , and federal rules adopted to implement those acts. If the Department of Transportation delegates inspection authority to the state as provided in this section, the commission shall do what is necessary to carry out its delegated federal authority. Section 7. That \u00a7 49-34B-19 be amended to read as follows: 49-34B-19.
