BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 61-5-25 be amended to read: 61-5-25. If an employer has met the requirements of \u00a7 61-5-24 on the computation date for the year, then the employer's contribution rate shall be the rate appearing in Column \"A\" on the same line on which the employer's reserve ratio appears in Column \"B\" of the rate schedule applicable to such that year. The computation date for calendar year 2012 and each year thereafter is June thirtieth of the preceding year. The rate schedule for each calendar year shall be determined based upon the South Dakota average high cost multiplier ratio. The average high cost multiplier ratio is calculated by dividing the amount in the unemployment compensation fund, as established by \u00a7 61-4-1, as of June thirtieth of the preceding year, by the amount required in the unemployment compensation fund that equals the average high cost multiple of 1.0, as of December thirty-first of the last completed calendar year. Schedule A is in effect for any calendar year when the South Dakota average high cost multiplier ratio is less than 1.60. Schedule B is in effect for any calendar year when the South Dakota average high cost multiplier ratio is greater than or equal to 1.60. For purposes of this section, the term, average high cost multiple, has the same meaning given in Code of Federal Regulations, title 20, section 606.3, as amended on January 1, 2017.

The employer's experience-rating account balance for the purpose of this section is the balance on July thirty-first of the year preceding the year for which rates are computed calculated and is the difference between the contributions paid through July thirty-first and the benefits paid through the preceding June thirtieth.
