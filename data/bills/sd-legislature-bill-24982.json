Section 2. That \u00a7 13-53-49 be AMENDED: 13-53-49.

The Board of Regents shall require each institution under its control to maintain a commitment to the principles of free expression and encourage the timely and rational discussion of topics in an environment that is intellectually and ideologically diverse.

Nothing in this section precludes the board or any institution under the control of the board from restricting or prohibiting the presence of minors at any program or event occurring on any state-owned property."}], "amendments": [{"bill_id": 24982, "document_id": 261812, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/261812.pdf", "legislator_profile_id": 4543, "document_id_instructions": 261833, "document_id_instructions_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/261833.pdf"}], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 24982, "action_date": "2024-01-18T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 260440, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/260440.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 84, "committee_id_action": 1197, "committee_id_assigned": 1203, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 24982, "action_date": "2024-01-24T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 261487, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/261487.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 1, "committee_id_action": 1203, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 24982, "action_date": "2024-01-24T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 261488, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/261488.pdf", "status_text": "Motion to amend", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 1203, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 24982, "action_date": "2024-01-24T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 261488, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/261488.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to the 41st legislative day", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 1203, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 78780, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [4476, 4486, 4495, 4505, 4552, 4551, 4532], "Nay": [4478, 4483, 4485, 4570], "Excused": [4504, 4525]}}]}
