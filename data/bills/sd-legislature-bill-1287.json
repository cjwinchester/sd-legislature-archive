WHEREAS, multinational corporations engaged in the development of genetically modified (GM) and genetically engineered (GE) seed, including Monsanto, have on occasion shown a pattern of disregard for the well-being of family farmers; and WHEREAS, it has been alleged that these corporations have attempted to monopolize the genetically modified (GM) and genetically engineered (GE) corn and soybean seed markets and conspired to restrain trade in those markets; and WHEREAS, it has been further alleged that these corporations conspired to fix the prices of genetically modified (GM) and genetically engineered (GE) corn and soybean seeds and rushed genetically modified (GM) and genetically engineered (GE) seeds to market without adequate testing for risks to human and animal health and the environment from such seeds and crops; and WHEREAS, industry leader Monsanto has on numerous occasions sued farmers for the age-old practice of saving seeds, and holds that it is illegal for farmers even to save seeds that have been cross-pollinated by genetically modified (GM) or genetically engineered (GE) seeds which have blown onto their fields from neighboring farms; and WHEREAS, these corporations have allegedly engaged in the international imposition of excessive \"technology fees\" upon farmers; and WHEREAS, in South Dakota, eighty to ninety percent of corn grown is from genetically modified (GM) or genetically engineered (GE) seed; and WHEREAS, the technology fee charged by Monsanto for genetically modified (GM) or genetically engineered (GE) corn has reached as high as one hundred fifty dollars per bag; and WHEREAS, even though genetically modified (GM) and genetically engineered (GE) soybeans were developed in part through research activity at South Dakota State University, Monsanto retains the rights to market the results of such research; and WHEREAS, Monsanto has pursued legal actions and engaged in other intimidating conduct against farmers who are claimed to have violated technology user agreements: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the Senate of the Eighty-fourth Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the House of Representatives concurring therein, that the South Dakota Legislature is concerned about practices in the genetically modified (GM) and genetically engineered (GE) seed industry related to possible restraint of trade, concentration, and monopolization and the resulting excessively high technology fees charged by the industry as well as intimidating and uncompetitive industry practices that are detrimental to South Dakota's agricultural producers and South Dakota's economy; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that Legislature finds that technology fees assessed against agricultural producers in conjunction with the use of genetically modified (GM) and genetically engineered (GE) seed in South Dakota have at times been exorbitantly high. The Legislature strongly urges the industry to reduce technology fees for the well-being of South Dakota's agricultural producers and institutions and for the benefit of South Dakota's agricultural economy."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 1287, "action_date": "2009-03-06T10:30:00-06:00", "document_id": 8872, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/8872.pdf", "status_text": "First Reading", "journal_page": 663, "committee_id_action": 54, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 1287, "action_date": "2009-03-09T14:00:00-05:00", "document_id": 8998, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/8998.pdf", "status_text": "Adopt Resolution", "journal_page": 683, "committee_id_action": 54, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "D", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 1287, "action_date": "2009-03-09T14:00:00-05:00", "document_id": 8998, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/8998.pdf", "status_text": "Tabled", "journal_page": 683, "committee_id_action": 54, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 5179, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [653, 680, 682, 685, 702, 649, 700, 655, 673, 663, 677, 675, 634, 697, 659, 690, 636, 667, 656, 661, 686, 701, 662, 703, 664, 638, 648, 640, 689, 694, 705, 642, 671], "Excused": [704], "Nay": [669]}}]}
