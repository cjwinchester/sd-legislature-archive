Section 29. A health care provider may, upon receiving briefing data from a licensed midwife, issue a medical order for the licensed midwife's client, without that client being an explicit patient of the provider. The provider giving the order is responsible and liable only for the appropriateness of the order given the data received. The issuing of an order for a licensed midwife's client does not constitute a delegation of duties from the other provider to the licensed midwife. Section 30. A health care provider may not be held civilly liable for rendering emergency medical services that arise from use of prohibited medications or surgical procedures on the part of the licensed midwife unless the emergency medical services constitute gross negligence or reckless disregard for the client. Section 31. A licensed midwife is solely responsible for the use of medications under this Act unless given under the direction of a licensed physician or other health care provider. Section 32. No person may obtain or attempt to obtain a license under this Act through bribery or fraudulent misrepresentation. A violation of this section is a Class 2 misdemeanor. Section 33. Nothing in this Act limits the right of any hospital to determine who shall have practice privileges in the facility. Section 34. No physician is liable for any care rendered by a midwife to a client if that client subsequently enters the care of a physician. Section 35. That chapter 36-9A be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Nothing in this chapter restricts the right of a licensed midwife to practice in accordance with this Act. Section 36. That chapter 36-4 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Nothing in this chapter restricts the right of a licensed midwife to practice in accordance with this Act."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 21525, "action_date": "2007-01-25T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 110857, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/110857.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 204, "committee_id_action": 923, "committee_id_assigned": 914, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 21525, "action_date": "2007-02-12T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 112006, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/112006.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 914, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 21525, "action_date": "2007-02-12T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 112006, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/112006.pdf", "status_text": "Hog Housed", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 914, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 21525, "action_date": "2007-02-12T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 112006, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/112006.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass Amended,", "journal_page": 441, "committee_id_action": 914, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 64977, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [3576, 3613, 3631, 3637, 3656], "Yea": [3588, 3620, 3624, 3645, 3646, 3662, 3671], "Excused": [3670]}}, {"bill_id": 21525, "action_date": "2007-02-14T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 112304, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/112304.pdf", "status_text": "Motion to Amend,", "journal_page": 524, "committee_id_action": 923, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 21525, "action_date": "2007-02-14T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 112304, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/112304.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass Amended,", "journal_page": 525, "committee_id_action": 923, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "F", "vote": {"vote_id": 67124, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [3572, 3576, 3580, 3581, 3582, 3588, 3592, 3593, 3594, 3597, 3598, 3600, 3605, 3609, 3611, 3613, 3614, 3620, 3622, 3624, 3629, 3631, 3635, 3637, 3649, 3650, 3651, 3653, 3654, 3655, 3656, 3658, 3660, 3663, 3665, 3666, 3668, 3670, 3672, 3673, 3675, 3584], "Yea": [3577, 3578, 3579, 3583, 3586, 3587, 3590, 3591, 3599, 3604, 3606, 3616, 3619, 3628, 3632, 3638, 3640, 3642, 3643, 3644, 3645, 3646, 3648, 3657, 3662, 3671, 3674, 3676]}}]}
