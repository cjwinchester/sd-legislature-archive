Upon a resident's admission into a treatment facility, or upon the resident's recovery of consciousness or capacity, the treatment facility shall inform the resident of the right to designate a caregiver to receive notice of the resident's treatment and aftercare plan.

A treatment facility may not be held liable in any civil action for failure to provide notice under this section. Nothing in this section prohibits a treatment facility, in the exercise of professional judgment and its experience with common practice to make reasonable inferences of the resident's best interests, from: (1) Determining not to disclose any information related to the resident to a caregiver designated under section 1 of this Act; and (2) Disclosing information related to the resident to a caregiver of the treatment facility's choice."}, {"bill_id": 9467, "bill_version_id": 54593, "bill_version": "Senate Health and Human Services Engrossed", "bill_version_date": "2019-03-04T16:28:09.067-06:00", "bill_text": "FOR AN ACT ENTITLED, An Act to provide for the designation of a caregiver to receive information regarding residents of treatment facilities.
