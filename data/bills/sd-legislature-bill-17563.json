BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. The Legislature finds that, in order to provide the state's children with the best educational opportunities possible, it is in the state's best interest to reward teachers who demonstrate outstanding performance in the classroom, in addition to relying on a traditional method of compensation based on education and experience. Section 2. The Department of Education and Cultural Affairs shall administer a program to reward certain eligible teachers in qualified school districts for performance by means of a performance bonus of not more than six thousand dollars per year, but not less than one thousand dollars per year. Section 3. The Department of Education and Cultural Affairs may allocate only those funds appropriated by the Legislature for the purposes of this Act to each qualified school district according to its relative portion of the total average daily membership as defined in \u00a7 13-13- 10.1. Any qualified school district may access a portion of the funds for the program if the school district implements a plan to reward teachers who demonstrate excellence and mastery in their profession. All moneys allocated for school districts that are not qualified school districts shall be redistributed to the qualified school districts on an average daily membership basis. Section 4. If a qualified school district identifies a teacher who has demonstrated excellence and mastery in the current school year, the qualified school district shall provide a written recommendation and substantiation, along with the specific amount of the bonus to be paid, to the Department of Education and Cultural Affairs after April first but before May first. The qualified school district may reward individual eligible teachers, a team of eligible teachers, or a group of eligible teachers on a school-wide basis. The qualified school district is limited to requesting bonuses in an amount not to exceed the amount allocated for such school district. Section 5. For purposes of this Act, an eligible teacher must: (1) Exhibit excellence and mastery in both a subject area and teaching methods; (2) Demonstrate improved student performance based on multiple criteria; and (3) Comply with the plan developed by the qualified school district. Section 6. For purposes of this Act, a qualified school district is one that meets the following criteria: (1) All the teachers in the school district are evaluated on at least an annual basis; (2) The school board approves a plan to reward eligible teachers that is based on measured criteria and developed by members of the community, administrators, school board members, and teachers; (3) The school district identifies a panel of individuals designated to select the eligible teachers who will receive a reward. The panel shall include a teacher, an administrator, a school board member, a student, a parent, and a member of the business community; (4) The school district rewards selected teachers on a discretionary basis according to the plan and does not use funds from the program to reward all teachers in the school district; and (5) The school district rewards selected teachers without a reduction or offset in their regular salaries. Section 7. Each participating school district shall annually submit a plan to the Department of Education and Cultural Affairs by September first. The department shall approve or disapprove the plan based on the criteria in section 6 of this Act. By October first, the department shall notify each school district of the status of the school district's plan and the amount of funds available for this program per qualifying school district. Section 8. The secretary of the Department of Education and Cultural Affairs shall approve vouchers and the state auditor shall draw warrants to pay expenditures authorized by this Act."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 17563, "action_date": "2003-01-27T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 95822, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/95822.pdf", "status_text": "First read in Senate and referred to", "journal_page": 195, "committee_id_action": 799, "committee_id_assigned": 774, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 17563, "action_date": "2003-01-30T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 96142, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/96142.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to 41st legislative day", "journal_page": 245, "committee_id_action": 774, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 55787, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [2851, 2886, 2916, 2928], "Nay": [2852, 2868, 2908]}}, {"bill_id": 17563, "action_date": "2003-01-30T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 96142, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/96142.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 774, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/17563"}
