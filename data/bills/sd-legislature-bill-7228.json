The notice shall contain the time, date, and location of the pending discharge. The inpatient facility shall record in the person's medical record the time the notice of pending discharge is given, to whom, how the notice was given, who gave the notice, the set time for discharge, and the time the law enforcement official or agency obtained custody of the person after the notice was given, if applicable.
