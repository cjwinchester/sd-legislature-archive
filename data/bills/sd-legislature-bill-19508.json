The application must be in the name of an individual and, except as otherwise provided in subsection (b), signed or otherwise authenticated by the applicant under penalty of perjury and state or contain: (1) The name of the applicant and the address of the applicant's principal place of business; (2) The name of the applicant's business or employer, if applicable; (3) Any business or occupation engaged in by the applicant for the five years next preceding the date of submission of the application; (4) A description of the applicant's: (A) Formal training as an athlete agent; (B) Practical experience as an athlete agent; and (C) Educational background relating to the applicant's activities as an athlete agent; (5) The names and addresses of three individuals not related to the applicant who are willing to serve as references; (6) The name, sport, and last known team for each individual for whom the applicant acted as an athlete agent during the five years next preceding the date of submission of the application; (7) The names and addresses of all persons who are: (A) With respect to the athlete agent's business if it is not a corporation, the partners, members, officers, managers, associates, or profit-sharers of the business; and (B) With respect to a corporation employing the athlete agent, the officers, directors, and any shareholder of the corporation having an interest of five percent or greater; (8) Whether the applicant or any person named pursuant to paragraph (7) has been convicted of a crime that, if committed in this state, would be a crime involving moral turpitude or a felony, and identify the crime; (9) Whether there has been any administrative or judicial determination that the applicant or any person named pursuant to paragraph (7) has made a false, misleading, deceptive, or fraudulent representation; (10) Any instance in which the conduct of the applicant or any person named pursuant to paragraph (7) resulted in the imposition of a sanction, suspension, or declaration of ineligibility to participate in an interscholastic or intercollegiate athletic event on a student-athlete or educational institution; (11) Any sanction, suspension, or disciplinary action taken against the applicant or any person named pursuant to paragraph (7) arising out of occupational or professional conduct; and (12) Whether there has been any denial of an application for, suspension or revocation of, or refusal to renew, the registration or licensure of the applicant or any person named pursuant to paragraph (7) as an athlete agent in any state. (b) An individual who has submitted an application for, and holds a certificate of, registration or licensure as an athlete agent in another state, may submit a copy of the application and certificate in lieu of submitting an application in the form prescribed pursuant to subsection (a). The Secretary of State shall accept the application and the certificate from the other state as an application for registration in this state if the application to the other state: (1) Was submitted in the other state within six months next preceding the submission of the application in this state and the applicant certifies that the information contained in the application is current; (2) Contains information substantially similar to or more comprehensive than that required in an application submitted in this state; and (3) Was signed by the applicant under penalty of perjury.

(b) The Secretary of State may refuse to issue a certificate of registration if the Secretary of State determines that the applicant has engaged in conduct that has a significant adverse effect on the applicant's fitness to act as an athlete agent. In making the determination, the Secretary of State may consider whether the applicant has: (1) Been convicted of a crime that, if committed in this state, would be a crime involving moral turpitude or a felony; (2) Made a materially false, misleading, deceptive, or fraudulent representation in the application or as an athlete agent; (3) Engaged in conduct that would disqualify the applicant from serving in a fiduciary capacity; (4) Engaged in conduct prohibited by section 14 of this Act; (5) Had a registration or licensure as an athlete agent suspended, revoked, or denied or been refused renewal of registration or licensure as an athlete agent in any state; (6) Engaged in conduct the consequence of which was that a sanction, suspension, or declaration of ineligibility to participate in an interscholastic or intercollegiate athletic event was imposed on a student-athlete or educational institution; or (7) Engaged in conduct that significantly adversely reflects on the applicant's credibility, honesty, or integrity.

The application for renewal must be signed by the applicant under penalty of perjury and must contain current information on all matters required in an original registration. (e) An individual who has submitted an application for renewal of registration or licensure in another state, in lieu of submitting an application for renewal in the form prescribed pursuant to subsection (d), may file a copy of the application for renewal and a valid certificate of registration or licensure from the other state.

(f) A certificate of registration or a renewal of a registration is valid for two years. Section 7.

CANCELLATION OF THIS CONTRACT MAY NOT REINSTATE YOUR ELIGIBILITY. (d) An agency contract that does not conform to this section is voidable by the student- athlete.

(c) A right of action under this section does not accrue until the educational institution discovers or by the exercise of reasonable diligence would have discovered the violation by the athlete agent or former student-athlete. (d) Any liability of the athlete agent or the former student-athlete under this section is several and not joint.
