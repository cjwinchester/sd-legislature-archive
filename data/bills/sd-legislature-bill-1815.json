No member whose contributions for the coverage year were insufficient to pay for its incurred liability losses and its proportional allocation of operating expenses may be eligible for a distribution. The bureau may establish a separate class of members whose funded reserve is established by bonds issued pursuant to this chapter. This class of members shall have premiums established to reflect both their risk exposure and the funding and repayment requirements for the bonds. In addition, the bureau may enter into agreements with sub-pools limited solely to funding reserves for the sub-pool. These agreements shall provide terms and penalties for payment of obligations. The term for membership of funded reserve members and funding only sub-pools shall be established by the bureau and may be any period of time in excess of three years not to exceed twenty years.

If this chapter is found unconstitutional or any part of it is stricken by a court of competent jurisdiction, which action frustrates the purpose of this chapter to provide limited liability coverage for the member public entities of South Dakota, or is terminated by legislative action, the assets of the fund shall be distributed as surplus funds are distributed pursuant to \u00a7 3-22-14. Sufficient funds or annuities shall be retained in the fund to fulfill any obligations assumed prior to the dissolution of the PEPL. Section 15. That \u00a7 3-22-22 be repealed. 3-22-22.

Such assessment shall be one half of one percent of the total annual budget for school district members and one percent of the total annual budget for all other members. If members of an existing risk or liability pool arrangement join the PEPL fund as a sub-pool, their initial contribution shall be established in the agreement between the sub-pool and the bureau giving consideration to contributions made to the sub-pool and may be more or less than the initial contribution established in this section.

The eight hundred fifty thousand dollar reserve fund, less any amounts paid in satisfaction of claims against the state, shall be repaid to the state general fund upon a determination by the bureau that other reserve funds are adequate to meet the needs of the fund but in no event later than June 30, 1992. By November first of each subsequent year the director shall report to the Governor the estimated amount of contribution required to extend coverage to the state for the next contribution year including amounts required for reserves. The director shall notify the Governor if the current year's estimate was less than the contribution required and a shortfall exists.

The board shall notify all remaining members of the state's withdrawal from the fund. Section 11. That \u00a7 3-22-13.1 be repealed. 3-22-13.1.

The bureau may exercise any or all powers enumerated in chapter 1-16E and in addition may issue bonds that do constitute a debt or obligation of member political subdivisions provided any such bond is secured for payment of principal and interest by the proceeds of irrepealable tax levies of the participating member political subdivisions as provided in this chapter. Section 12. That \u00a7 3-22-14 be repealed. 3-22-14. The bureau shall, from time to time, examine the claims reserves of the PEPL for each coverage year and, in the event the bureau determines that there is a surplus for such coverage year, the bureau may distribute such surplus to the current members on the basis of each member's contributions and loss experience for that coverage year. The amount of surplus to be distributed shall be established by the bureau after independent actuarial determination of the adequacy of reserves. No member whose contributions for the coverage year were insufficient to pay for its incurred liability losses and its proportional allocation of operating expenses may be eligible for a distribution. The bureau may establish a separate class of members whose funded reserve is established by bonds issued pursuant to this chapter. This class of members shall have premiums established to reflect both their risk exposure and the funding and repayment requirements for the bonds. In addition, the bureau may enter into agreements with sub-pools limited solely to funding reserves for the sub-pool. These agreements shall provide terms and penalties for payment of obligations. The term for membership of funded reserve members and funding only sub-pools shall be established by the bureau and may be any period of time in excess of three years not to exceed twenty years. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a member seeking to join the class of members with fully funded reserves or a debt funded sub-pool may establish an irrepealable levy pursuant to chapter 6-8B for payment of premium and bond redemption obligations.

The defense of sovereign immunity shall always be raised in support of the provisions of \u00a7 3-22-10. In all cases in which the fund is or may be involved, at any time prior to final judgment, the attorney general shall notify in writing a claimant or claimants of his determination that a claim or any number of related claims may threaten the financial viability of the fund and of his intention to raise the defense of sovereign immunity. Pursuant to S.D. Const., Art. III, \u00a7 27, suits against the state are authorized only for a covered claim to the extent coverage is provided in the coverage document.

That \u00a7 3-22-20 be amended to read as follows: 3-22-20. This chapter is intended as direct state action within the meaning of federal antitrust laws. If this chapter is found unconstitutional or any part of it is stricken by a court of competent jurisdiction, which action frustrates the purpose of this chapter to provide limited liability coverage for the member public entities of South Dakota, or is terminated by legislative action, the assets of the fund shall be distributed as surplus funds are distributed pursuant to \u00a7 3- 22-14. Sufficient funds or annuities shall be retained in the fund to fulfill any obligations assumed prior to the dissolution of the PEPL. Section 15. That \u00a7 3-22-22 be repealed. 3-22-22.
