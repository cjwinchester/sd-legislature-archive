BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 3-8-13 be amended to read as follows: 3-8-13. Any state employee who is employed in a position that is eligible for longevity pay and has at least seven years of employment with the State of South Dakota is entitled to longevity compensation. The longevity compensation for years of employment seven to ten, inclusive, is one hundred dollars. The longevity compensation for years of employment eleven to fourteen, inclusive, is equal to ten dollars per year of employment until the fifteenth year of service at which time the longevity pay shall be equal to fifteen dollars per year of service. Longevity pay shall increase at five dollar increments thereafter for each additional five years of employment. The longevity compensation may not be affected by any other compensation and classification plan except that the longevity compensation shall be distributed in the same manner and form as prescribed in \u00a7 3-8-6. It is payable annually in one lump sum. The commissioner of the Bureau of Personnel shall promulgate rules pursuant to chapter 1-26 to determine the state employee position categories that are eligible for longevity pay, the criteria for payment for prior years of service, the date for payment, and the type of service that may be used to calculate longevity. The only Board of Regents' employees eligible for longevity pay are those nonfaculty permanent full-time employees who are customarily employed for twenty hours or more a week at least six months a year. Any agent, patrolman, or employee of the Division of Highway Patrol of the Department of Commerce and Regulation may elect to receive longevity pay under this section or under \u00a7 32-2-10, but may not receive longevity pay under both provisions at the same time."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 12876, "action_date": "1997-01-28T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 72886, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/72886.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 172, "committee_id_action": 544, "committee_id_assigned": 531, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 12876, "action_date": "1997-02-04T08:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 72278, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/72278.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 531, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 12876, "action_date": "1997-02-14T08:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 72366, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/72366.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 531, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 12876, "action_date": "1997-02-14T08:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 72366, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/72366.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to 41st legislative day", "journal_page": 483, "committee_id_action": 531, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 35689, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [1896, 1906, 1933, 1952, 1957, 1966, 1964], "Nay": [1913, 1974, 1944]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/12876"}
