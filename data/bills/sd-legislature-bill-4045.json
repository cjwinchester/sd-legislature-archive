BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. There is hereby established a school-to-work grant program in the Department of Education. The purpose of the grant program is to support partnerships among school districts, local employers, and communities that are formed to assist high school seniors, who may not pursue postsecondary education, in their transition from high school to the workforce. The school-to-work partnerships receiving funding through the grant program will build connections between school and work by providing these students with the academic preparation, career development opportunities, and work-based learning experiences they need while at the same time providing communities and local employers with assistance in meeting their workforce needs. For the 2013-2014 school year, any school district that is seeking to partner with local employers or communities pursuant to this Act may apply to the Board of Education for funding through the grant program on forms provided by the Department of Education. The Board of Education shall promulgate rules pursuant to chapter 1-26 establishing the timelines for the grant application process, the criteria the board will use in selecting grant recipients from among the applying school districts, and the amount of the grant each selected school-to-work partnership will receive. At the conclusion of the 2013-2014 school year, any school-to-work partnership receiving a grant pursuant to this Act shall report to the Board of Education and to the Legislature on the number of students served through the school-to-work partnership, the employment status of those students served, and the local employers and communities that benefitted from the school-to-work partnership. Section 2. There is hereby appropriated from the general fund the sum of three hundred thousand dollars ($300,000), or so much thereof as may be necessary, to the Department of Education for distribution to selected school-to-work partnerships through the school-to-work grant program established in section 1 of this Act. Section 3. The secretary of education shall approve vouchers and the state auditor shall draw warrants to pay expenditures authorized by this Act. Section 4. Any amounts appropriated in this Act not lawfully expended or obligated by June 30, 2014, shall revert in accordance with the procedures prescribed in chapter 4-8."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 4045, "action_date": "2013-01-22T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 24266, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/24266.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 129, "committee_id_action": 202, "committee_id_assigned": 189, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 4045, "action_date": "2013-01-28T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 24624, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/24624.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 189, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 4045, "action_date": "2013-01-28T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 24755, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/24755.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to the 41st legislative day", "journal_page": 203, "committee_id_action": 189, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 13003, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [420, 396, 414, 405, 391], "Yea": [418, 412, 416, 389, 378, 406, 361, 373, 374, 357]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/4045"}
