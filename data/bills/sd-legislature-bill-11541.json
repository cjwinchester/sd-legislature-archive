Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of South Dakota: Section 1. That \u00a7 58-29C-45 be AMENDED: 58-29C-45. Purpose of chapter--Creation of association. A. The purpose of this chapter is to protect, subject to certain limitations, the persons specified in subpart A of \u00a7 58-29C-46 against failure in the performance of contractual obligations, under life and, health insurance policies, and annuity policies, plans, or contracts specified in subpart B of \u00a7 58-29C-46, because of the impairment or insolvency of the member insurer that issued the policies, plans, or contracts. B. To provide this protection, an association of member insurers is organized to pay benefits and to continue coverages as limited by this chapter, and members of the association are subject to assessment to provide funds to carry out the purpose of this chapter. Section 2. That \u00a7 58-29C-46 be AMENDED: 58-29C-46. Persons provided with coverage--Policies and portions of policies not covered. A. This chapter shall provide coverage for the policies and contracts specified in subpart B: (1) To persons who, regardless of where they reside (except for nonresident certificate holders under group policies or contracts), are the beneficiaries, assignees, or payees of the persons covered under subdivision (2); (2) To persons who are owners of or certificate holders under the policies or contracts (other than structured settlement annuities) and in each case who: (a) Are residents; or (b) Are not residents, but only under all of the following conditions: (i) The member insurer that issued the policies or contracts is domiciled in this state; (ii) The states in which the persons reside have associations similar to the association created by this chapter; and (iii) The persons are not eligible for coverage by an association in any other state due to the fact that the insurer was not licensed in the state at the time specified in the state's guaranty association law; (3) For structured settlement annuities specified in subpart B, subdivisions (1) and (2) of this subpart do not apply, and this chapter shall (except as provided in subdivisions (4) and (5) of this subpart) provide coverage to a person who is a payee under a structured settlement annuity (or beneficiary of a payee if the payee is deceased), if the payee: (a) Is a resident, regardless of where the contract owner resides; or (b) Is not a resident, but only under both of the following conditions: (i)(I) The contract owner of the structured settlement annuity is a resident, or (II) The contract owner of the structured settlement annuity is not a resident, but the insurer that issued the structured settlement annuity is domiciled in this state and the state in which the contract owner resides has an association similar to the association created by this chapter; and (ii) Neither the payee (or beneficiary) nor the contract owner is eligible for coverage by the association of the state in which the payee or contract owner resides; (4) This chapter does not provide coverage to a person who is a payee (or beneficiary) of a contract owner resident of this state, if the payee (or beneficiary) is afforded any coverage by the association of another state; (5) This chapter is intended to provide coverage to a person who is a resident of this state and, in special circumstances, to a nonresident. In order to avoid duplicate coverage, if a person who would otherwise receive coverage under this chapter is provided coverage under the laws of any other state, the person may not be provided coverage under this chapter. In determining the application of the provisions of this paragraph in situations where a person could be covered by the association of more than one state, whether as an owner, payee, beneficiary, or assignee, this chapter shall be construed in conjunction with other state laws to result in coverage by only one association.

However, the corporation is subject to the provisions of this title on matters and procedures of mergers and licensure of insurance producers. The corporation is also subject to fees and taxation as insurers under \u00a7 58-2-29 and chapter 10-44. The corporation is also subject to \u00a7\u00a7 58-17-53 and 58-17-54 if entering into a contract after July 1, 1990, with the State of South Dakota, counties, school districts, municipalities, and any other unit of state government using public funds.

Health maintenance organizations are also subject to the following chapters: 58-1, 58-2, 58-3, 58-4, 58-5, 58-5A, 58-6, 58-7, 58-11, 58-12, 58-14, 58-17, 58-17A, 58-17F, 58-17G, 58-17H, 58-17I, 58-18, 58-18A, 58-18B, 58-18C, 58-26, 58-27, 58-29B on the same basis as insurers, 58-30, 58-33A; and 58-43. Nothing in chapters 58-5 or 58-6 shall may be construed to prohibit a nonprofit health maintenance organization from transacting business under this title based upon its nonprofit status. To the extent that a health maintenance organization is compliant with the provisions of chapters 58-17F to 58-17I, inclusive, for purposes of network adequacy, quality assessment and improvements, utilization review and benefit determinations, and grievance procedure, the health maintenance organization is compliant with the provisions of this chapter."}, {"bill_id": 11541, "bill_version_id": 66668, "bill_version": "Enrolled", "bill_version_date": "2020-02-06T08:27:52.697-06:00", "bill_text": "ENTITLED An Act to revise certain provisions regarding life and health insurance insolvencies. Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of South Dakota: Section 1. That \u00a7 58-29C-45 be AMENDED: 58-29C-45. Purpose of chapter--Creation of association. A. The purpose of this chapter is to protect, subject to certain limitations, the persons specified in subpart A of \u00a7 58-29C-46 against failure in the performance of contractual obligations, under life, health, and annuity policies, plans, or contracts specified in subpart B of \u00a7 58-29C-46, because of the impairment or insolvency of the member insurer that issued the policies, plans, or contracts. B. To provide this protection, an association of member insurers is organized to pay benefits and to continue coverages as limited by this chapter, and members of the association are subject to assessment to provide funds to carry out the purpose of this chapter. Section 2. That \u00a7 58-29C-46 be AMENDED: 58-29C-46. Persons provided with coverage--Policies and portions of policies not covered. A. This chapter shall provide coverage for the policies and contracts specified in subpart B: (1) To persons who, regardless of where they reside (except for nonresident certificate holders under group policies or contracts), are the beneficiaries, assignees, or payees of the persons covered under subdivision (2); (2) To persons who are owners of or certificate holders under the policies or contracts (other than structured settlement annuities) and in each case who: (a) Are residents; or (b) Are not residents, but only under all of the following conditions: (i) The member insurer that issued the policies or contracts is domiciled in this state; (ii) The states in which the persons reside have associations similar to the association created by this chapter; and (iii) The persons are not eligible for coverage by an association in any other state due to the fact that the insurer was not licensed in the state at the time specified in the state's guaranty association law; (3) For structured settlement annuities specified in subpart B, subdivisions (1) and (2) of this subpart do not apply, and this chapter shall (except as provided in subdivisions (4) and (5) of this subpart) provide coverage to a person who is a payee under a structured settlement annuity (or beneficiary of a payee if the payee is deceased), if the payee: (a) Is a resident, regardless of where the contract owner resides; or (b) Is not a resident, but only under both of the following conditions: (i)(I) The contract owner of the structured settlement annuity is a resident, or (II) The contract owner of the structured settlement annuity is not a resident, but the insurer that issued the structured settlement annuity is domiciled in this state and the state in which the contract owner resides has an association similar to the association created by this chapter; and (ii) Neither the payee (or beneficiary) nor the contract owner is eligible for coverage by the association of the state in which the payee or contract owner resides; (4) This chapter does not provide coverage to a person who is a payee (or beneficiary) of a contract owner resident of this state, if the payee (or beneficiary) is afforded any coverage by the association of another state; (5) This chapter is intended to provide coverage to a person who is a resident of this state and, in special circumstances, to a nonresident.

If a policy's or contract's interest or changes in value are credited less frequently than annually, for purposes of determining the values that have been credited and are not subject to forfeiture under this subsection, the interest or change in value determined by using the procedures defined in the policy or contract shall be credited as if the contractual date of crediting interest or changing values was the date of impairment or insolvency, whichever is earlier, and will not be subject to forfeiture; and (l) A policy or contract providing any hospital, medical, prescription drug, or other health care benefits pursuant to Part C or Part D of Subchapter XVIII Chapter 7 of Title 42 of the United States Code (commonly known as Medicare Part C & D), or Subchapter XIX, Chapter 7 Title 42 of the United States Code (commonly known as Medicaid), or any regulations issued pursuant thereto.

The costs of the association's obligations under this chapter may be met by the use of assets attributable to covered policies or reimbursed to the association pursuant to its subrogation and assignment rights; and (e) For the purposes of this chapter, benefits provided by a long-term care rider to a life insurance policy or annuity contract are considered the same type of benefits as the base life insurance policy or annuity contract to which it relates. D. In performing its obligations to provide coverage under \u00a7 58-29C-51, the association may not be required to guarantee, assume, reinsure, reissue, or perform, or cause to be guaranteed, assumed, reinsured, reissued, or performed, the contractual obligations of the insolvent or impaired insurer under a covered policy or contract that do not materially affect the economic values or economic benefits of the covered policy or contract.

The association shall be entitled to retain a portion of any amount so paid to it equal to the percentage determined by dividing the aggregate amount of policy or contract owners' claims related to that insolvency for which the association has provided statutory benefits by the aggregate amount of all policy or contract owners' claims in this state related to that insolvency and shall remit to the domiciliary receiver the amount paid to the association less the amount retained pursuant to this subpart. Any amount paid to the association and retained by the association shall be treated as a distribution of estate assets pursuant to \u00a7 58-29B-98 or similar provision of the state of domicile of the impaired or insolvent insurer. H. If the association fails to act within a reasonable period of time with respect to an insolvent insurer, as provided in subpart B of this section, the director shall have the powers and duties of the association under this chapter with respect to the insolvent insurer. I. The association may render assistance and advice to the director, upon the director's request, concerning rehabilitation, payment of claims, continuance of coverage, or the performance of other contractual obligations of an impaired or insolvent insurer. J. The association shall have standing to appear or intervene before a court or agency in this state with jurisdiction over an impaired or insolvent insurer concerning which the association is or may become obligated under this chapter or with jurisdiction over any person or property against which the association may have rights through subrogation or otherwise. Standing extends to all matters germane to the powers and duties of the association, including proposals for reinsuring, reissuing, modifying, or guaranteeing the policies or contracts of the impaired or insolvent insurer and the determination of the policies or contracts and contractual obligations. The association also has the right to appear or intervene before a court or agency in another state with jurisdiction over an impaired or insolvent insurer for which the association is or may become obligated or with jurisdiction over any person or property against whom the association may have rights through subrogation or otherwise. K. (1) A person receiving benefits under this chapter is determined to have assigned the rights under, and any causes of action against any person for losses arising under, resulting from, or otherwise relating to, the covered policy or contract to the association to the extent of the benefits received because of this chapter, whether the benefits are payments of or on account of contractual obligations, continuation of coverage, or provision of substitute or alternative policies, contracts, or coverages. The association may require an assignment to the association of the rights and cause of action by any payee, policy, or contract owner, beneficiary, insured, or annuitant as a condition precedent to the receipt of any right or benefits conferred by this chapter upon the person. (2) The subrogation rights of the association under this subpart have the same priority against the assets of the impaired or insolvent insurer as that possessed by the person entitled to receive benefits under this chapter. (3) In addition to subdivisions (1) and (2) of this subpart, the association shall have all common law rights of subrogation and any other equitable or legal remedy that would have been available to the impaired or insolvent insurer or owner, beneficiary, or payee of a policy or contract with respect to the policy or contracts. (4) If the preceding provisions of this subpart are invalid or ineffective with respect to any person or claim for any reason, the amount payable by the association with respect to the related covered obligations shall be reduced by the amount realized by any other person with respect to the person or claim that is attributable to the policies or contracts (or portion thereof) covered by the association. (5) If the association has provided benefits with respect to a covered obligation and a person recovers amounts as to which the association has rights as described in the preceding subdivisions of this subpart, the person shall pay to the association the portion of the recovery attributable to the policies or contracts (or portion thereof) covered by the association. L. In addition to the rights and powers elsewhere in this chapter, the association may: (1) Enter into such contracts as are necessary or proper to carry out the provisions and purposes of this chapter; (2) Sue or be sued, including taking any legal actions necessary or proper to recover any unpaid assessments under \u00a7 58-29C-52 and to settle claims or potential claims against it; (3) Borrow money to effect the purposes of this chapter; any notes or other evidence of indebtedness of the association not in default are legal investments for domestic member insurers and may be carried as admitted assets; (4) Employ or retain any persons as necessary or appropriate to handle the financial transactions of the association, and to perform other functions as become necessary or proper under this chapter; (5) Take legal action as may be necessary or appropriate to avoid or recover payment of improper claims; (6) Exercise, for the purposes of this chapter and to the extent approved by the director, the powers of a domestic life insurer or health insurer, but in no case may the association issue policies or contracts other than those issued to perform its obligations under this chapter; (7) Organize the association as a corporation or in other legal form permitted by the laws of the state; (8) Request information from a person seeking coverage from the association in order to aid the association in determining its obligations under this chapter with respect to the person, and the person shall promptly comply with the request; (9) Unless prohibited by law, in accordance with the terms and conditions of the policy or contract, file for actuarially justified rate or premium increases for any policy or contract for which the association provides coverage under this chapter; and (10) Take other necessary or appropriate action to discharge the duties and obligations of the association as provided in this chapter or to exercise its powers under this chapter. M. The association may join an organization of one or more other state associations of similar purposes to further the purposes and administer the powers and duties of the association. N. (1)(a) At any time within one hundred eighty days of the date of the order of liquidation, the association may elect to succeed to the rights and obligations of the ceding member insurer that relate to policies, contracts, or annuities covered, in whole or in part, by the association, in each case under any one or more reinsurance contracts entered into by the insolvent insurer and its reinsurers and selected by the association. Any election shall be effective as of the date of the order of liquidation. The election shall be effected by the association or the National Organization of Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Associations (NOLHGA) on its behalf sending written notice, return receipt requested, to the affected reinsurers. (b) To facilitate the earliest practicable decision about whether to assume any of the contracts of reinsurance, and in order to protect the financial position of the estate, the receiver and each reinsurer of the ceding member insurer shall make available upon request to the association or to NOLHGA on its behalf as soon as possible after commencement of formal delinquency proceedings: (i) Copies of in-force contracts of reinsurance and all related files and records relevant to the determination of whether contracts should be assumed; and (ii) Notices of any defaults under the reinsurance contracts or any known event or condition which with the passage of time could become a default under the reinsurance contracts. (c) Subparagraphs (i) to (iv) apply to reinsurance contracts so assumed by the association: (i) The association is responsible for all unpaid premiums due under the reinsurance contracts for periods both before and after the date of the order of liquidation, and is responsible for the performance of all other obligations to be performed after the date of the order of liquidation, in each case which relate to policies, contracts, or annuities covered, in whole or in part, by the association. The association may charge policies, contracts, or annuities covered in part by the association, through reasonable allocation methods, the costs for reinsurance in excess of the obligations of the association and shall provide notice and an accounting of these charges to the liquidator; (ii) The association is entitled to any amounts payable by the reinsurer under the reinsurance contracts with respect to losses or events that occur in periods after the date of the order of liquidation and that relate to policies, contracts, or annuities covered, in whole or in part, by the association, provided that, upon receipt of any amounts, the association is obliged to pay to the beneficiary under the policy, contract, or annuity on account of which the amounts were paid a portion of the amount equal to the lesser of: (A) The amount received by the association; and (B) The excess of the amount received by the association, over the amount equal to the benefits paid by the association on account of the policy, contract, or annuity less the retention of the insurer applicable to the loss or event. (iii) Within thirty days following the association's election (the \"election date\"), the association and each reinsurer under contracts assumed by the association shall calculate the net balance due to or from the association under each reinsurance contract as of the election date with respect to policies, contracts, or annuities covered, in whole or in part, by the association, which calculation shall give full credit to all items paid by either the member insurer or its receiver or the reinsurer prior to the election date. The reinsurer shall pay the receiver any amounts due for losses or events prior to the date of the order of liquidation, subject to any set-off for premiums unpaid for periods prior to the date, and the association or reinsurer shall pay any remaining balance due the other, in each case within five days of the completion of the aforementioned calculation. Any disputes over the amounts due to either the association or the reinsurer shall be resolved by arbitration pursuant to the terms of the affected reinsurance contracts or, if the contract contains no arbitration clause, as otherwise provided by law. If the receiver has received any amounts due the association pursuant to subparagraph (1)(c)(ii), the receiver shall remit the amounts to the association as promptly as practicable. (iv) If the association or receiver, on the association's behalf, within sixty days of the election date, pays the unpaid premiums due for periods both before and after the election date that relate to policies, contracts, or annuities covered, in whole or in part by the association, the reinsurer may not terminate the reinsurance contracts for failure to pay premium insofar as the reinsurance contracts relate to policies, contracts, or annuities covered, in whole or in part, by the association, and may not set off any unpaid amounts due under other contracts, or unpaid amounts due from parties other than the association, against amounts due the association. (2) During the period from the date of the order of liquidation until the election date (or, if the election date does not occur, until one hundred eighty days after the date of the order of liquidation); (a)(i) Neither the association nor the reinsurer has any rights or obligations under reinsurance contracts that the association has the right to assume under subdivision (1), whether for periods prior to or after the date of the order of liquidation; and (ii) The reinsurer, the receiver, and the association shall, to the extent practicable, provide each other data and records reasonably requested; (b) Provided that once the association elects to assume a reinsurance contract, the parties' rights and obligations shall be governed by subdivision (1). (3) If the association does not elect to assume a reinsurance contract by the election date pursuant to subdivision (1), the association shall have no rights or obligations, in each case for periods both before and after the date of the order of liquidation, with respect to the reinsurance contract. (4) When policies, contracts, or annuities, or covered obligations with respect thereto, are transferred to an assuming insurer, reinsurance on the policies, contracts, or annuities may also be transferred by the association, in the case of contracts assumed under subdivision (1), subject to the following: (a) Unless the reinsurer and the assuming insurer agree otherwise, the reinsurance contract transferred may not cover any new policies of insurance or annuities in addition to those transferred; (b) The obligations described in subdivision (1) of this section no longer apply with respect to matters arising after the effective date of the transfer; and (c) The transferring party shall give notice in writing, return receipt requested, to the affected reinsurer not less than thirty days prior to the effective date of the transfer; (5) The provisions of subpart N supersede the provisions of any state law or of any affected reinsurance contract that provides for or requires any payment of reinsurance proceeds, on account of losses or events that occur in periods after the date of the order of liquidation, to the receiver of the insolvent insurer or any other person. The receiver remains entitled to any amounts payable by the reinsurer under the reinsurance contracts with respect to losses or events that occur in periods prior to the date of the order of liquidation, subject to applicable setoff provisions; and (6) Except as otherwise provided in this section, nothing in subpart N alters or modifies the terms and conditions of any reinsurance contract. Nothing in this section abrogates or limits any rights of any reinsurer to claim that the reinsurer is entitled to rescind a reinsurance contract. Nothing in this section gives a policyholder, policy owner, contract owner, certificate holder, or beneficiary an independent cause of action against a reinsurer that is not otherwise set forth in the reinsurance contract. No provision in this section limits or affects the association's rights as a creditor of the estate against the assets of the estate. No provision in this section applies to reinsurance agreements covering property or casualty risks. O. The board of directors of the association shall have discretion and may exercise reasonable business judgment to determine the means by which the association is to provide the benefits of this chapter in an economical and efficient manner. P. If the association has arranged or offered to provide the benefits of this chapter to a covered person under a plan or arrangement that fulfills the association's obligations under this chapter, the person is not entitled to benefits from the association in addition to or other than those provided under the plan or arrangement. Q. Venue in a suit against the association arising under the chapter is in Hughes County. The association may not be required to give an appeal bond in an appeal that relates to a cause of action arising under this chapter. R. In carrying out the association's duties in connection with guaranteeing, assuming, reissuing, or reinsuring policies or contracts under subpart A or B of this section, the association may issue substitute coverage for a policy or contract that provides an interest rate, crediting rate, or similar factor determined by use of an index or other external reference stated in the policy or contract employed in calculating returns or changes in value by issuing an alternative policy or contract in accordance with the following provisions: (1) In lieu of the index or other external reference provided for in the original policy or contract, the alternative policy or contract provides for (i) a fixed interest rate or (ii) payment of dividends with minimum guarantees or (iii) different methods for calculating interest or changes in value; (2) There is no requirement for evidence of insurability, waiting period, or other exclusion that would not have applied under the replaced policy or contract; and (3) The alternative policy or contract is substantially similar to the replaced policy or contract in all other material terms. Section 6. That \u00a7 58-29C-52 be AMENDED: 58-29C-52. Funding provided by assessment of members--Classification of assessments--Amounts of assessments--Abatements--Refunds. A. For the purpose of providing the funds necessary to carry out the powers and duties of the association, the board of directors shall assess the member insurers, separately for each account, at the time and for the amounts as the board finds necessary. Assessments are due not less than thirty days after prior written notice to the member insurers and accrue interest at ten percent per annum on and after the due date. B. There are two classes of assessments, as follows: (1) Class A assessments are authorized and called for the purpose of meeting administrative and legal costs and other expenses. Class A assessments may be authorized and called whether or not related to a particular impaired or insolvent insurer. (2) Class B assessments are authorized and called to the extent necessary to carry out the powers and duties of the association under \u00a7 58-29C-51 with regard to an impaired or an insolvent insurer. C. (1) The amount of a Class A assessment shall be determined by the board and may be authorized and called on a pro rata or non-pro rata basis. If pro rata, the board may provide that it be credited against future Class B assessments. (2) The amount of a Class B assessment, except for assessments related to long-term care insurance shall be allocated for assessment purposes between the accounts and among the subaccounts of the life insurance and annuity account, pursuant to an allocation formula which may be based on the premiums or reserves of the impaired or insolvent insurer or any other standard the board in its sole discretion determines is fair and reasonable under the circumstances. (3) The amount of the Class B assessment for long-term care insurance written by the impaired or insolvent insurer shall be allocated according to a methodology included in the association's plan of operation and approved by the director. The methodology shall provide for fifty percent of the assessment to be allocated to accident and health member insurers and fifty percent to be allocated to life and annuity member insurers. (4) Class B assessments against member insurers for each account and subaccount shall be in the proportion that the premiums received on business in this state by each assessed member insurer on policies or contracts covered by each account for the three most recent calendar years for which information is available preceding the year in which the member insurer became insolvent (or, in the case of an assessment with respect to an impaired insurer, the three most recent calendar years for which information is available preceding the year in which the member insurer became impaired) bears to premiums received on business in this state for those calendar years by all assessed member insurers. (5) Assessments for funds to meet the requirements of the association with respect to an impaired or insolvent insurer may not be authorized or called until necessary to implement the purposes of this chapter. Classification of assessments under subpart B and computation of assessments under this subpart shall be made with a reasonable degree of accuracy, recognizing that exact determinations may not always be possible. The association shall notify each member insurer of the member insurer's anticipated pro rata share of an authorized assessment not yet called within one hundred eighty days after the assessment is authorized. D. The association may abate or defer, in whole or in part, the assessment of a member insurer if, in the opinion of the board, payment of the assessment would endanger the ability of the member insurer to fulfill its contractual obligations. In the event an assessment against a member insurer is abated, or deferred in whole or in part, the amount by which the assessment is abated or deferred may be assessed against the other member insurers in a manner consistent with the basis for assessments set forth in this section. Once the conditions that caused a deferral have been removed or rectified, the member insurer shall pay all assessments that were deferred pursuant to a repayment plan approved by the association. E. (1)(a) Subject to the provisions of subsection (b) of this subdivision, the total of all assessments authorized by the association with respect to a member insurer for each subaccount of the life insurance and annuity account and for the health account may not in one calendar year exceed two percent of that member insurer's average annual premiums received in this state on the policies and contracts covered by the subaccount or account during the three calendar years preceding the year in which the member insurer became an impaired or insolvent insurer. (b) If two or more assessments are authorized in one calendar year with respect to member insurers that become impaired or insolvent in different calendar years, the average annual premiums for purposes of the aggregate assessment percentage limitation referenced in subsection (a) of this subdivision shall be equal and limited to the higher of the three-year average annual premiums for the applicable subaccount or account as calculated pursuant to this section. (c) If the maximum assessment, together with the other assets of the association in an account, does not provide in one year in either account an amount sufficient to carry out the responsibilities of the association, the necessary additional funds shall be assessed as soon thereafter as permitted by this chapter. (2) The board may provide in the plan of operation a method of allocating funds among claims, whether relating to one or more impaired or insolvent insurers, when the maximum assessment will be insufficient to cover anticipated claims. (3) If the maximum assessment for a subaccount of the life and annuity account in one year does not provide an amount sufficient to carry out the responsibilities of the association, then pursuant to subdivision C(4), the board shall assess the other subaccounts of the life and annuity account for the necessary additional amount, subject to the maximum stated in subdivision (1) of this section. F. The board may, by an equitable method as established in the plan of operation, refund to member insurers, in proportion to the contribution of each member insurer to that account, the amount by which the assets of the account exceed the amount the board determines is necessary to carry out during the coming year the obligations of the association with regard to that account, including assets accruing from assignment, subrogation, net realized gains, and income from investments. A reasonable amount may be retained in any account to provide funds for the continuing expenses of the association and for future claims. G. It is proper for any member insurer, in determining the member insurer's premium rates and policy owner dividends as to any kind of insurance within the scope of this chapter, to consider the amount reasonably necessary to meet the member insurer's assessment obligations under this chapter. H. The association shall issue to each member insurer paying an assessment under this chapter, other than a Class A assessment, a certificate of contribution, in a form prescribed by the director, for the amount of the assessment paid. All outstanding certificates are of equal dignity and priority without reference to amounts or dates of issue. The member insurer in its financial statement may show a certificate of contribution as an asset in the form, amount, and period of time as approved by the director. I. (1) A member insurer that wishes to protest all or part of an assessment shall pay when due the full amount of the assessment as set forth in the notice provided by the association. The payment is available to meet association obligations during the pendency of the protest or any subsequent appeal. Payment shall be accompanied by a statement in writing that the payment is made under protest and setting forth a brief statement of the grounds for the protest. (2) Within sixty days following the payment of an assessment under protest by a member insurer, the association shall notify the member insurer in writing of the association's determination with respect to the protest unless the association notifies the member insurer that additional time is required to resolve the issues raised by the protest. (3) Within thirty days after a final decision has been made, the association shall notify the protesting member insurer in writing of that final decision. Within sixty days of receipt of notice of the final decision, the protesting member insurer may appeal that final action to the director. (4) In the alternative to rendering a final decision with respect to a protest based on a question regarding the assessment base, the association may refer protests to the director for a final decision, with or without a recommendation from the association. (5) If the protest or appeal on the assessment is upheld, the amount paid in error or excess shall be returned to the member insurer. Interest on a refund due a protesting member insurer shall be paid at the rate actually earned by the association. J. The association may request information of member insurers in order to aid in the exercise of the association's power under this section and member insurers shall promptly comply with a request. Section 7. That \u00a7 58-29C-55 be AMENDED: 58-29C-55. Detection and prevention of insurer insolvencies or impairments--Reports by board. To aid in the detection and prevention of member insurer insolvencies or impairments, A. It is the duty of the director: (1) To notify the directors of all the other states, territories of the United States and the District of Columbia within thirty days following the action taken or the date the action occurs, when the director takes any of the following actions against a member insurer: (a) Revocation of license; (b) Suspension of license; or (c) Makes a formal order that the member insurer restrict its premium writing, obtain additional contributions to surplus, withdraw from the state, reinsure all or any part of the member insurer's business, or increase capital, surplus, or any other account for the security of policy owners, contract owners, certificate holders, or creditors. (2) To report to the board of directors when the director has taken any of the actions set forth in subdivision (1) or has received a report from any other director indicating that any action has been taken in another state. The report to the board of directors shall contain all significant details of the action taken or the report received from another director. (3) To report to the board of directors when the director has reasonable cause to believe from an examination, whether completed or in process, of any member insurer that the insurer may be an impaired or insolvent insurer. (4) To furnish to the board of directors the National Association of Insurance Commissioners Insurance Regulatory Information System (IRIS) ratios and listings of companies not included in the ratios developed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, and the board may use the information contained therein in carrying out the board's duties and responsibilities under this section. The report and the information contained therein shall be kept confidential by the board of directors until the report is made public by the director or other lawful authority. B. The director may seek the advice and recommendations of the board of directors concerning any matter affecting the duties and responsibilities of the director regarding the financial condition of member insurers and companies seeking admission to transact insurance business in this state. C. The board of directors may, upon majority vote, make reports and recommendations to the director upon any matter germane to the solvency, liquidation, rehabilitation, or conservation of any member insurer or germane to the solvency of any company seeking to do insurance business in this state. The reports and recommendations are not public documents. D. The board of directors may, upon majority vote, notify the director of any information indicating a member insurer may be an impaired or insolvent insurer. E. The board of directors may, upon majority vote, make recommendations to the director for the detection and prevention of member insurer insolvencies. Section 8. That \u00a7 58-29C-57 be AMENDED: 58-29C-57. Liability for unpaid assessment--Records of meetings--Association as creditor of impaired or insolvent insurer--Liquidation, rehabilitation, or conservation proceedings. A. This chapter may not be construed to reduce the liability for unpaid assessments of the insureds of an impaired or insolvent insurer operating under a plan with assessment liability. B. Records shall be kept of all meetings of the board of directors to discuss the activities of the association in carrying out the board's powers and duties under \u00a7 58-29C-51. The records of the association with respect to an impaired or insolvent insurer may not be disclosed prior to the termination of a liquidation, rehabilitation, or conservation proceeding involving the impaired or insolvent insurer, except (i) upon the termination of the impairment or insolvency of the insurer, or (ii) upon the order of a court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this subpart limits the duty of the association to render a report of its activities under \u00a7 58-29C-58. C. For the purpose of carrying out the association's obligations under this chapter, the association is a creditor of the impaired or insolvent insurer to the extent of assets attributable to covered policies reduced by any amounts to which the association is entitled as subrogee pursuant to subpart \u00a7 58-29C-51K. Assets of the impaired or insolvent insurer attributable to covered policies or contracts shall be used to continue all covered policies and pay all contractual obligations of the impaired or insolvent insurer as required by this chapter. Assets attributable to covered policies or contracts, as used in this subpart, are that proportion of the assets which the reserves that should have been established for the policies or contracts bear to the reserves that should have been established for all policies of insurance or health benefit plans written by the impaired or insolvent insurer. D. As a creditor of the impaired or insolvent insurer as established in subpart C of this section and consistent with \u00a7 58-29B-98, the association and other similar associations are entitled to receive a disbursement of assets out of the marshaled assets, from time to time as the assets become available to reimburse the association, as a credit against contractual obligations under this chapter. If the liquidator has not, within one hundred twenty days of a final determination of insolvency of a member insurer by the receivership court, made an application to the court for the approval of a proposal to disburse assets out of marshaled assets to guaranty associations having obligations because of the insolvency, the association is entitled to make application to the receivership court for approval of the association's own proposal to disburse these assets. E. (1) Prior to the termination of any liquidation, rehabilitation, or conservation proceeding, the court may take into consideration the contributions of the respective parties, including the association, the shareholders, contract owners, certificate holders, and policy owners of the insolvent insurer, and any other party with a bona fide interest, in making an equitable distribution of the ownership rights of the insolvent insurer. In a determination, consideration must be given to the welfare of the policy owners, contract owners, and certificate holders of the continuing or successor member insurer. (2) An impaired or insolvent insurer may not make a distribution to stockholders until and unless the total amount of valid claims of the association with interest thereon for funds expended in carrying out the association's powers and duties under \u00a7 58-29C-51 with respect to the member insurer have been fully recovered by the association. F. (1) If an order for liquidation or rehabilitation of a member insurer domiciled in this state has been entered, the receiver appointed under the order has a right to recover on behalf of the member insurer, from any affiliate that controlled it, the amount of distributions, other than stock dividends paid by the member insurer on its capital stock, made at any time during the five years preceding the petition for liquidation or rehabilitation subject to the limitations of subdivisions (2) to (4), inclusive. (2) No distribution is recoverable if the member insurer shows that when paid the distribution was lawful and reasonable, and that the member insurer did not know and could not reasonably have known that the distribution might adversely affect the ability of the member insurer to fulfill the member insurer's contractual obligations. (3) Any person who was an affiliate that controlled the member insurer at the time the distributions were paid is liable up to the amount of distributions received. Any person, who was an affiliate that controlled the member insurer at the time the distributions were declared, shall be liable up to the amount of distributions which would have been received if the distributions had been paid immediately. If two or more persons are liable with respect to the same distributions, the persons shall be jointly and severally liable. (4) The maximum amount recoverable under this subpart is the amount needed in excess of all other available assets of the insolvent insurer to pay the contractual obligations of the insolvent insurer. (5) If any person liable under subdivision (3) is insolvent, all the member insurer's affiliates that controlled the member insurer at the time the distribution was paid, shall be jointly and severally liable for any resulting deficiency in the amount recovered from the insolvent affiliate. Section 9. That \u00a7 58-29C-62 be AMENDED: 58-29C-62. Use of existence of association for sales, solicitation, or inducement to purchase insurance prohibited--Summary document of purposes and limitations of chapter--Disclaimer. A. No person, including a member insurer, agent, or affiliate of a member insurer may make, publish, disseminate, circulate, or place before the public, or cause directly or indirectly, to be made, published, disseminated, circulated, or placed before the public, in any newspaper, magazine, or other publication, or in the form of a notice, circular, pamphlet, letter, or poster, or over any radio station or television station, or in any other way, any advertisement, announcement, or statement, written or oral, which uses the existence of the Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Association of this state for the purpose of sales, solicitation, or inducement to purchase any form of insurance covered by the South Dakota Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Association chapter. However, this section does not apply to the South Dakota Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Association or any other entity which does not sell or solicit insurance. B. Within one hundred eighty days of July 1, 2003, the association shall prepare a summary document describing the general purposes and current limitations of the chapter and complying with subpart C of this section. This document shall be submitted to the director for approval. At the expiration of the sixtieth day after the date on which the director approves the document, a member insurer may not deliver a policy or contract to a policy owner, contract owner, or certificate owner unless the summary document is delivered to the policy owner, contract owner, or certificate holder at the time of delivery of the policy or contract. The document shall also be available upon request by a policy owner, contract owner, or certificate holder. The distribution, delivery, or contents or interpretation of this document does not guarantee that either the policy or the contract or the policy owner, contract owner, or certificate holder is covered in the event of the impairment or insolvency of a member insurer. The description document shall be revised by the association as amendments to the chapter may require. Failure to receive this document does not give the policy owner, contract owner, certificate holder, or insured any greater rights than those stated in this chapter. C. The document prepared under subpart B shall contain a clear and conspicuous disclaimer on its face. The director shall establish the form and content of the disclaimer. The disclaimer shall: (1) State the name and address of the Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Association and insurance department; (2) Prominently warn the policy owner, contract owner, or certificate holder that the Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Association may not cover the policy or, if coverage is available, it shall be subject to substantial limitations and exclusions and conditioned on continued residence in this state; (3) State the types of policies or contracts for which guaranty funds will provide coverage; (4) State that the member insurer and the member insurer's agents are prohibited by law from using the existence of the Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Association for the purpose of sales, solicitation, or inducement to purchase any form of insurance; (5) State that the policy owner, contract owner, or certificate holder should not rely on coverage under the Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Association when selecting an insurer; (6) Explain rights available and procedures for filing a complaint to allege a violation of any provisions of this chapter; and (7) Provide other information as directed by the director including sources for information about the financial condition of insurers provided that the information is not proprietary and is subject to disclosure under that state's public records law. D. A member insurer shall retain evidence of compliance with subpart B as long as the policy or contract for which the notice is given remains in effect. Section 10. That a NEW SECTION be added: 58-41-52.1. Collection for covered services prohibited. Except for coinsurance, deductibles, or copayments as specifically provided in the evidence of coverage, in no event, including nonpayment by the health maintenance organization, insolvency of the health maintenance organization, or breach of contract among the health maintenance organization, risk bearing entity, or participating provider, may a risk bearing entity or participating provider bill, charge, collect a deposit from, seek compensation, remuneration or reimbursement from, or have any recourse against an enrollee or a person other than the health maintenance organization acting on behalf of the enrollee for covered services provided. No risk bearing entity or participating provider, nor any agent, trustee or assignee of the risk bearing entity or participating provider may maintain an action at law against an enrollee to collect sums owed by the health maintenance organization. Section 11. That a NEW SECTION be added: 58-41-52.2. Contracts--Hold harmless provision. All contracts among health maintenance organizations, risk bearing entities, and participating providers shall include a hold harmless provision specifying protection for enrollees consistent with \u00a7\u00a7 58-41-52.1 to 58-41-52.3, inclusive. Any attempted waiver or amendment in a manner materially adverse to the interests of enrollees of a hold harmless provision are null and void and unenforceable. Any violation of the provisions of this section constitutes an unfair trade practice under chapter 58-33. Section 12. That a NEW SECTION be added: 58-41-52.3. Hold harmless provision--Language of provision. The requirements of \u00a7 58-41-52.2 shall be met by including a provision substantially similar to the following: Provider agrees that in no event, including but not limited to nonpayment by the health maintenance organization or intermediary organization, insolvency of the health maintenance organization or intermediary organization, or breach of this agreement, may the provider bill, charge, collect a deposit from, seek compensation, remuneration or reimbursement from, or have any recourse against an enrollee or a person (other than the health maintenance organization or intermediary organization) acting on behalf of the enrollee for covered services provided pursuant to this agreement. This agreement does not prohibit the provider from collecting coinsurance, deductibles, copayments or services in excess of limits, as specifically provided in the evidence of coverage, or fees for uncovered services delivered on a fee-for-service basis to enrollees. Section 13. That \u00a7 58-41-26 be AMENDED: 58-41-26. Exemption from insurance laws--Exceptions--Taxation. Any health maintenance organization is exempt from all provisions of the insurance laws of this state other than this chapter. However, the corporation is subject to the provisions of this title on matters and procedures of mergers and licensure of insurance producers. The corporation is also subject to fees and taxation as insurers under \u00a7 58-2-29 and chapter 10-44. The corporation is also subject to \u00a7\u00a7 58-17-53 and 58-17-54 if entering into a contract after July 1, 1990, with the State of South Dakota, counties, school districts, municipalities, and any other unit of state government using public funds. The state, however, may not collect premium taxes for insurance written on individuals residing outside this state or property located outside this state if no comparable tax is paid by the direct writing health maintenance organization to any appropriate taxing authority. Health maintenance organizations are also subject to the following chapters: 58-1, 58-2, 58-3, 58-4, 58-5, 58-5A, 58-6, 58-7, 58-11, 58-12, 58-14, 58-17, 58-17A, 58-17F, 58-17G, 58-17H, 58-17I, 58-18, 58-18A, 58-18B, 58-18C, 58-26, 58-27, 58-29B on the same basis as insurers, 58-30, 58-33A; and 58-43. Nothing in chapters 58-5 or 58-6 may be construed to prohibit a nonprofit health maintenance organization from transacting business under this title based upon its nonprofit status. To the extent that a health maintenance organization is compliant with the provisions of chapters 58-17F to 58-17I, inclusive, for purposes of network adequacy, quality assessment and improvements, utilization review and benefit determinations, and grievance procedure, the health maintenance organization is compliant with the provisions of this chapter.
