BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA, THE SENATE CONCURRING THEREIN: Section 1. That at the next general election held in the state, the following amendment to Article XI of the Constitution of the State of South Dakota, as set forth in section 2 of this Joint Resolution, which is hereby agreed to, shall be submitted to the electors of the state for approval. Section 2. That ARTICLE XI of the Constitution of the State of South Dakota be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: \u00a7 15. The Legislature shall impose an individual and corporate income tax in the session following the ratification of this amendment. The revenue and interest generated by such income tax, less the cost of administration, is dedicated for the purpose of funding property tax relief by reducing the tax levy for the general fund and the special education fund of a school district. The Legislature shall also provide and define an exemption for food, utilities, residential heating fuel, and intrastate trucking services from the sales and use tax with the revenue and interest generated by such income tax. After the tax levies for the general fund and the special education fund of a school district are eliminated, the remaining revenue is dedicated to increasing the state aid to elementary and secondary education through the per student allocation and if additional revenue is available it shall be used for other tax relief. The Legislature shall impose the individual income tax based on the federal taxable income. The Legislature shall impose an individual income tax not to exceed three percent of the first twenty thousand dollars of federal taxable income, four and one-half percent of the next twenty thousand dollars of federal taxable income, and six percent of federal taxable income over forty thousand dollars. The Legislature shall not impose a corporate income tax in excess of six percent of the federal taxable income. Section 3. The tax exemptions provided in this amendment are effective July first during the first year that the state receives revenue from the individual and corporate income tax imposed by this amendment."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 15549, "action_date": "2000-01-20T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 85634, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/85634.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 160, "committee_id_action": 656, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 15549, "action_date": "2000-01-21T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 85636, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/85636.pdf", "status_text": "Referred to", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 656, "committee_id_assigned": 652, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 15549, "action_date": "2000-01-27T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 85791, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/85791.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 652, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 15549, "action_date": "2000-01-27T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 85791, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/85791.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to 36th legislative day", "journal_page": 264, "committee_id_action": 652, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 45469, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [2305, 2348, 2371, 2378, 2402], "Yea": [2324, 2342, 2353, 2372, 2377, 2379, 2393, 2363]}}, {"bill_id": 15549, "action_date": "2000-01-27T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 85791, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/85791.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to 36th legislative day", "journal_page": 264, "committee_id_action": 652, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 45469, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [2305, 2348, 2371, 2378, 2402], "Yea": [2324, 2342, 2353, 2372, 2377, 2379, 2393, 2363]}}]}
