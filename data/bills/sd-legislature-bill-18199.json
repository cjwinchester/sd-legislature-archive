For taxes payable in 2002 2004 and each year thereafter, the levy for the general fund of a school district shall be as follows: (1) The maximum tax levy shall be thirteen dollars and ninety-three cents per thousand dollars of taxable valuation subject to the limitations on agricultural property as provided in subdivision (2) of this section, owner-occupied property as provided for in subdivision (3) of this section, and nonagricultural acreage property as provided for in subdivision (4) of this section; (2) The maximum tax levy on agricultural property for such school district shall be four dollars and four cents per thousand dollars of taxable valuation. If the district's levies are less than the maximum levies as stated in this section, the levies shall maintain the same proportion to each other as represented in the mathematical relationship at the maximum levies; (3) The maximum tax levy for an owner-occupied single-family dwelling as defined in \u00a7 10-13-40, for such school district may not exceed six dollars and fifty cents per thousand dollars of taxable valuation. If the district's levies are less than the maximum levies as stated in this section, the levies shall maintain the same proportion to each other as represented in the mathematical relationship at the maximum levies; and (4) The maximum tax levy on nonagricultural acreage property as defined in \u00a7 10-6-33.14, for such school district shall be five dollars and four cents per thousand dollars of taxable valuation. If the district's levies are less than the maximum levies as stated in this section, the levies shall maintain the same proportion to each other as represented in the mathematical relationship at the maximum levies. All levies in this section shall be imposed on valuations where the median level of assessment represents eighty-five percent of market value as determined by the Department of Revenue. These valuations shall be used for all school funding purposes. If the district has imposed an excess levy pursuant to \u00a7 10-12-43 before July 1, 2003 , the levies shall maintain the same proportion to each other as represented in the mathematical relationship at the maximum levies in this section. If the district imposes an excess levy pursuant to \u00a7 10-12-43 on or after July 1, 2003, the excess levy shall be made in proportion to the taxable valuation without regard to the maximum levies in this section.
