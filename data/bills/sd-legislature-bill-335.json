BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 58-16-4 be amended to read as follows: 58-16-4. The amounts of insurance under a policy issued under \u00a7 58-16-2 shall be based upon some plan precluding individual selection either by the employees or by the employer or trustees. Supplemental life coverage may be purchased at the employee's option subject to the underwriting criteria of the insurer. Section 2. That \u00a7 58-16-6 be amended to read as follows: 58-16-6. The premium for a policy issued under \u00a7 58-16-2 shall may be paid entirely by the policyholder, either wholly from the employer's fund or funds contributed by him, or partly from such funds and partly from funds contributed by the insured employees. No policy may be issued on which the entire premium is to be derived from funds contributed by the insured employees. A policy on which part of the premium is to be derived from funds contributed by the insured employees may be placed in force only if at least seventy-five percent of the then eligible employees, excluding any as to whom evidence of individual insurability is not satisfactory to the insurer, elect to make the required contributions or by funds paid entirely by the insured employees, or by funds contributed by both the policyholder and the insured employees . A policy on which no part of the premium is to be derived from funds contributed by the insured employees must insure all eligible employees, or all except any as to whom evidence of individual insurability is not satisfactory to the insurer. For supplemental life coverage, the employee may be required to pay the entire premium. Section 3. That \u00a7 58-16-15 be repealed. 58-16-15. The amount of insurance under a policy issued under \u00a7 58-16-12 must be based upon some plan precluding individual selection either by the insured persons or by the policyholder, employers, or
