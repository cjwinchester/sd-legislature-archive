At the conclusion of the first nine years of operation, the charter school may apply for renewal.

No governing board or school district employee may take unlawful reprisal against an educational program of the school or the school district because an application to establish a charter school proposes the conversion of all or a portion of the educational program to a charter school. As used in this section, the term, unlawful reprisal, means an action that is taken by a governing board or a school district employee as a direct result of a lawful application to establish a charter school and that is adverse to another employee or an education program and: (1) With respect to a school district employee, results in one or more of the following: (a) Disciplinary or corrective action; (b) Detail, transfer, or reassignment; (c) Suspension, demotion, or dismissal; (d) An unfavorable performance evaluation; (e) A reduction in pay, benefits, or awards; (f) Elimination of the employee's position without a reduction in force by reason of lack of monies or work; or (g) Other significant changes in duties or responsibilities that are inconsistent with the employee's salary or employment classification; or (2) With respect to an educational program, results in one or more of the following: (a) Suspension or termination of the program; (b) Transfer or reassignment of the program to a less favorable department; (c) Relocation of the program to a less favorable site within the school or school district; or (d) Significant reduction or termination of funding for the program.

The pool may charge the requesting charter school reasonable fees for any services it performs in connection with the insurance program. Section 17. No charter school may acquire property by eminent domain. Section 18. No sponsor, including members, officers, and employees of the sponsor, is personally liable for any act done or action taken in good faith within the scope of its authority. Section 19.

The sponsoring entity of a charter school has oversight and administrative responsibility for the charter schools that is sponsors. Section 21. Charter schools may pledge, assign, or encumber their assets to be used as collateral for loans or extensions of credit. Section 22. A transfer or a charter to another sponsor, a transfer of a charter school site to another sponsor, or a transfer of a charter school site to a different charter shall be completed before the beginning of the fiscal year that the transfer is scheduled to become effective. An entity that sponsors charter schools may accept a transferring school after the beginning of the fiscal year if the transfer is approved by the secretary of education. The secretary of education has the discretion to consider each transfer during the fiscal year on a case by case basis. If a charter school is sponsored by a school district that is determined to be out of compliance with state statute, the uniform system of financial records, or any other state or federal law, the charter school may transfer to another sponsoring entity at any time during the fiscal year. Section 23. No sponsoring entity may charge any fees to a charter school that it sponsors unless the sponsor has provided services to the charter school and the fees represent the full value of those services provided by the sponsor. On request, the value of the services provided by the sponsor to the charter school shall be demonstrated to the Department of Education. Section 24. A charter school shall enroll all eligible pupils who submit a timely application, unless the number of applications exceeds the capacity of a program, class, grade level, or building. A charter school shall give enrollment preference to pupils returning to the charter school in the second or any subsequent year of its operation and to siblings of pupils already enrolled in the charter school. A charter school that is sponsored by a school district governing board shall give enrollment preference to eligible pupils who reside within the boundaries of the school district where the charter school is physically located. If capacity is insufficient to enroll all pupils who submit a timely application, the charter school shall select pupils through an equitable selection process. Section 25. A charter school may limit admission to pupils within a given age group or grade level. However, no charter school may limit admission based on academic potential or achievement, ethnicity, national origin, religion, gender, sexual orientation, income level, disabling condition, proficiency in the English language, athletic ability, or special cost considerations with regard to the education of special needs students. Section 26. A charter school may refuse to admit any pupil who has been expelled from another educational institution or who is in the process of being expelled from another educational institution. Section 27. A teacher who is employed by, or teaching at, a charter school and who was previously employed as a teacher at a school district does not lose any right of certification, retirement status, salary status, or any other benefit provided by law, by the rules of the governing board of the school district, or by the rules of the board of directors of the charter school due to teaching at a charter school on the teacher's return to the school district if the teacher requested and was granted a leave of absence prior to employment by the charter school. Section 28. A teacher who is employed by, or teaching at, a charter school and who submits an employment application to the school district where the teacher was employed immediately before employment by or at a charter school shall be given employment preference by the school district if all of the following conditions are met: (1) The teacher submits an employment application to the school district no later than three years after ceasing employment with the school district; and (2) A suitable position is available at the school district; and (3) The teacher requested and was granted a leave of absence prior to employment by the charter school. Section 29. A charter school that is sponsored by a school district governing board, the State Board of Education, or the State Board for Public Charter Schools is eligible to participate in the state retirement system. Section 30. If a pupil who was previously enrolled in a charter school enrolls in a public school in this state, the public school shall accept credits earned by the pupil in courses or instructional programs at the charter school in a uniform and consistent manner and according to the same criteria that are used to accept academic credits from other public schools. Section 31. Although it is the intent of this Act that any charter school organized pursuant to this Act be eligible to apply for and receive federal grant funding, nothing in this Act may be construed to imply the charter school is ineligible for state funding to the same degree and pursuant to the same circumstances as any other public school. Section 32. Any charter school organized pursuant to this Act is subject to all public sector labor relations statutes not otherwise inconsistent with the provisions of this Act. All charter school employees have the same collective bargaining rights as other public school employees. Section 33. Any charter school organized pursuant to this Act is subject to the same audit provisions that apply to any other public school. Section 34. Any charter school organized pursuant to this Act is subject to the same reporting requirements that apply to any other public school. Section 35.
