Section 2. That chapter 32-3 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: For the purposes of this Act, the term, nonrepairable vehicle, means any passenger motor vehicle which is incapable of safe operation for use on highways and which has no resale value except as a source of parts or scrap only or which the owner irreversibly designates as a source of parts or scrap. Section 3. That chapter 32-3 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: For the purposes of this Act, the term, nonrepairable vehicle certificate, means a passenger motor vehicle ownership document issued by the department to the owner of a nonrepairable vehicle. Ownership of a passenger motor vehicle may only be transferred two times on a nonrepairable vehicle certificate. No passenger motor vehicle for which a nonrepairable vehicle certificate has been issued may be titled for use on the highways. A nonrepairable vehicle certificate shall be labeled across the front with the word: Nonrepairable. Section 4. That chapter 32-3 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: For the purposes of this Act, the term, passenger motor vehicle, means any vehicle driven or drawn by mechanical power manufactured primarily for use on the highways that is nine model years old or less, including any multipurpose passenger vehicle or light duty truck if that vehicle or truck is rated at not more than sixteen thousand pounds gross vehicle weight. The term does not include a motorcycle, trailer, snowmobile, or manufactured home. Section 5. That chapter 32-3 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: For the purposes of this Act, the term, rebuilt title, means the passenger motor vehicle ownership document issued by the department to the owner of a rebuilt vehicle.

That chapter 32-3 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: For the purposes of this Act, the term, rebuilt vehicle, means any passenger motor vehicle which was previously issued a salvage title; has passed a state anti-theft inspection; was issued an affidavit that the vehicle was rebuilt to nationally-recognized standards; has been issued a certificate indicating that the vehicle has passed the required anti-theft inspection; and has a decal affixed to the driver's door jam stating: Rebuilt Vehicle--Anti-Theft Inspection Passed. Section 7. That chapter 32-3 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: For the purposes of this Act, the term, salvage title, means a passenger motor vehicle ownership document issued by the department to the owner of a salvage vehicle.

A salvage title shall be labeled across the front with the word: Salvage. Section 8. That chapter 32-3 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: For the purposes of this Act, the term, salvage vehicle, means any passenger motor vehicle which has been wrecked, destroyed, or damaged to the extent that the total estimated or actual cost of parts and labor to rebuild or reconstruct the vehicle to its pre-accident condition and for legal operation on the highways exceeds seventy-five percent of the retail value of the vehicle, as set forth in a current edition of any nationally-recognized compilation, to include automated data bases, of retail values. The value of repair parts for purposes of this section shall be determined by using the current published retail cost of the repair parts to be used in the repair. If the retail value of labor has not been determined by a purchase in the ordinary course of business (for example, the labor is performed by the owner of the vehicle), the retail value of the labor is presumed to be the product of the repair time, as provided in a generally accepted auto body repair flat rate manual, multiplied by thirty-five dollars. The term also includes any passenger motor vehicle for which its owner chooses to obtain a salvage title, without regard to the extent of the vehicle's damage and repairs. Such a choice by the owner does not impose on the insurer of the vehicle or an insurer processing a claim made by or on behalf of the owner of the vehicle any obligations or liabilities. Section 9.

If the title shows any lien, the lien holder's consent to the issuance of the nonrepairable certificate shall be endorsed on the certificate of title.
