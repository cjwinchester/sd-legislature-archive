BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. If, in the previous school fiscal year, the general fund balance percentage of a school district, as defined in subdivision 13-13-10.1(7), is fifty percent or greater, the school district shall, for any teacher employed in the district for at least a second consecutive term of employment, compensate the teacher for certain expenses. The expenses for which the school district shall compensate the teacher include the cost of tuition and generally applicable fees for up to six graduate education credits per fiscal year and the cost of renewing the teacher's certificate to teach. No school district may use a teacher's compensation pursuant to this Act as grounds for nonrenewing the teacher's contract of employment with the school district. 170 copies were printed on recycled paper by the South Dakota Legislative Research Council at a cost of $.098 per page. .
