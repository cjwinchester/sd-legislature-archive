BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 49-34A-101 be amended to read as follows: 49-34A-101. There is hereby established a state renewable, recycled, and conserved energy objective that ten percent of all electricity sold at retail within the state by the year 2015 2020 be obtained from renewable, recycled, and conserved energy sources. In the case of renewable and recycled energy, the objective shall be measured by qualifying megawatt hours delivered at retail or by certificates representing credits purchased and retired to offset nonqualifying retail sales. In the case of conserved energy, the objective shall be measured by methods established by rules promulgated by the commission pursuant to chapter 1-26. This objective is voluntary, and there is no penalty or sanction for a retail provider of electricity that fails to meet this objective. The objective applies to each retail provider of electricity in the state, regardless of the ownership status of the electricity retailer. Any municipal or cooperative utility that receives wholesale electricity through a municipal power agency or generation and transmission cooperative may aggregate the utility's renewable, recycled, and conserved energy objective resources to meet this objective."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 6794, "action_date": "2015-02-03T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 34394, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/34394.pdf", "status_text": "First Reading House", "journal_page": 260, "committee_id_action": 286, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 6794, "action_date": "2015-02-04T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 34477, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/34477.pdf", "status_text": "Referred to", "journal_page": 284, "committee_id_action": 286, "committee_id_assigned": 272, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 6794, "action_date": "2015-02-20T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 35167, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/35167.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 272, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 6794, "action_date": "2015-02-20T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 35371, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/35371.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to the 41st legislative day", "journal_page": 471, "committee_id_action": 272, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 18926, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [952, 931, 937, 882, 956, 906, 950, 932, 949, 934, 957, 864], "Excused": [933]}}]}
