WHEREAS, it is within the power of state government to protect and further the public health and welfare; and WHEREAS, the production of agricultural products constitutes a paramount industry of the Midwestern States, which provides substantial revenues for the states and their political subdivisions, which provides employment and a means of livelihood for a substantial part of the population of the Midwestern States, and which furnishes essential foods that are vital to the public health and welfare of the nation and world; and WHEREAS, when family agriculture producers have received parity prices for their commodities, prosperity has been felt throughout the economies of our states; and WHEREAS, the inability of individual family producers to secure a reasonable return for agricultural products prevents producers from maintaining a reasonable standard of living, increases economic insecurity due to unemployment, and is a matter of general interest and concern requiring appropriate action by the state to reduce unemployment, financial depression, and economic instability: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the House of Representatives of the Seventy- sixth Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the Senate concurring therein, that the South Dakota Legislature supports minimum-price legislation for agricultural commodities; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that such legislation apply to all grades and types of the commodity produced, bought, or subject to normal price differentials reflecting grades and quality; that the minimum price should not be less than sixty percent of parity nor greater than one hundred percent of parity as defined by U.S.C., Title 7, section 1301, as amended through January 1, 1999, that supply management or orderly marketing procedures shall be adopted if levels of production threaten the disruption of normal marketing patterns, and that such laws be enforced through appropriate civil and criminal penalties."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 16375, "action_date": "2001-02-16T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 90288, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/90288.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to another day", "journal_page": 551, "committee_id_action": 712, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 16375, "action_date": "2001-02-20T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 90359, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/90359.pdf", "status_text": "Adopt Resolution", "journal_page": 593, "committee_id_action": 712, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "F", "vote": {"vote_id": 51585, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [2514, 2515, 2519, 2522, 2528, 2533, 2537, 2538, 2544, 2545, 2546, 2553, 2556, 2557, 2558, 2559, 2561, 2563, 2564, 2565, 2570, 2571, 2572, 2577, 2578, 2579, 2582, 2583, 2586, 2588, 2592, 2593, 2595, 2596, 2599, 2600, 2601, 2603, 2604, 2605, 2608, 2610, 2612, 2613, 2618, 2540], "Yea": [2518, 2525, 2527, 2530, 2541, 2543, 2547, 2548, 2554, 2555, 2560, 2566, 2568, 2574, 2575, 2587, 2589, 2591, 2594, 2602, 2611, 2614], "Excused": [2521, 2526]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/16375"}
