Nothing in \u00a7\u00a7 58-5-161 to 58-5-171, inclusive, may be construed to prescribe or impose corporate governance standards and internal procedures beyond that which is required under applicable state corporate law. Nothing in this Act may be construed to limit the director\u2019s authority, or the rights or obligations of third parties, under chapter 58-3. The requirements in \u00a7\u00a7 58-5-161 to 58-5-171, inclusive, apply to all insurers domiciled in this state. Section 3. That a NEW SECTION be added: 58-5-163. Submission of disclosure--Required. An insurer, or the insurance group of which the insurer is a member, shall submit a corporate governance annual disclosure containing the information described in \u00a7\u00a7 58-5-161 to 58-5-171, inclusive, to the director no later than June first of each calendar year. If the insurer is a member of an insurance group, the insurer shall submit the report required by this section to the director, commissioner, superintendent, or other official who is the lead state for the insurance group in accordance with the laws of the lead state. The disclosure must be signed by the insurer or insurance group's chief executive officer or corporate secretary attesting to the best of that individual's belief and knowledge that the insurer has implemented the corporate governance practices and that a copy of the disclosure has been provided to the insurer's board of directors or the appropriate committee thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the director may request any insurer to submit the disclosure. Section 4. That a NEW SECTION be added: 58-5-164. Information provided with disclosure--Appropriate corporate level. For purposes of completing the corporate governance annual disclosure, the insurer or insurance group may provide information regarding corporate governance at the ultimate controlling parent level, an intermediate holding company level, the individual legal entity level, or any combination of the levels depending upon how the insurer or insurance group has structured its system of corporate governance. An insurer or insurance group shall make the disclosures at the level where the insurer's or insurance group's: (1) Risk appetite is determined; (2) Earnings, capital, liquidity, operations, and reputation of the insurer are collectively overseen and the supervision of those factors is coordinated and exercised; or (3) Legal liability for failure of general corporate governance duties is placed. When an insurer or insurance group determines the level of reporting based on the criteria under this section, the insurer or insurance group shall indicate which of the criteria under this section was used to determine the level of reporting and explain any subsequent change in the level of reporting. Any additional request for information by the director shall be made through the lead state. Section 5. That a NEW SECTION be added: 58-5-165. Duplicate information not required--Documentation. An insurer who provides information substantially similar to the information required in \u00a7\u00a7 58-5-161 to 58-5-171, inclusive, in other documents provided to the director is not required to duplicate information in the corporate governance annual disclosure if the insurer reports where the information is included. Section 6. That a NEW SECTION be added: 58-5-166. Content and maintenance--Promulgation of Rules. The insurer or insurance group has discretion over the responses to the corporate governance annual disclosure inquiries if the disclosure contains the material information necessary to permit the director to gain an understanding of the insurer's or group's corporate governance structure, policies, and practices. The director may request additional information the director determines is material and necessary to provide a clear understanding of the corporate governance policies and the reporting or information system or controls implementing those policies. Documentation and supporting information must be maintained and made available upon examination by the division or upon a request of the director. The corporate governance annual disclosure must be prepared consistent with applicable administrative rules which may be promulgated by the division pursuant to chapter 1-26 regarding the contents and filing of the disclosure. Section 7. That a NEW SECTION be added: 58-5-167. Disclosure documents and other information--Confidential and privileged--Exempt from public record--Permitted uses.

The document, materials, or other information is confidential and privileged, is not a record open to public inspection under chapter 1-27, is not subject to subpoena, and is not discoverable or admissible in evidence in any private civil action. The director may use corporate governance annual disclosure documents, materials, or other information in the furtherance of any regulatory or legal action brought as a part of the director's official duties. The director may not otherwise make the document, materials, or other information public without the prior written consent of the insurer.

The director shall maintain as confidential or privileged any document, materials, or information received with notice or the understanding that it is confidential or privileged under the laws of the jurisdiction that is the source of the document, materials, or information. No waiver of any applicable privilege or claim of confidentiality in any document, proprietary and trade-secret materials, or other information related to the corporate governance annual disclosure may occur as a result of disclosure of any information or documents related to the disclosure to the director under this section or as a result of sharing under this section by the director.

Section 11. That a NEW SECTION be added: 58-5-171. Disclosure information--Access by National Association of Insurance Commissioners--Requirements.
