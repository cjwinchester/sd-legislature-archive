BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 61-1-35 be amended to read as follows: 61-1-35. As used in this title, unless the context otherwise plainly requires, prior to January 1, 1978, the term \"wages\" does not include that part of remuneration which, after remuneration equal to four thousand two hundred dollars has been paid in a calendar year to an individual by an employer or his predecessor with respect to employment during any calendar year, is paid to such individual by such employer during such calendar year unless that part of the remuneration is subject to a tax under a federal law imposing a tax against which credit may be taken for contributions required to be paid into a state unemployment fund. From January 1, 1978, to December 31, 1982, the term \"wages\" does not include that part of remuneration which, after remuneration equal to six thousand dollars has been paid in a calendar year to an individual by an employer or his predecessor with respect to employment during any calendar year, is paid to such individual by such employer during such calendar year unless that part of the remuneration is subject to a tax under a federal law imposing a tax against which credit may be taken for contributions required to be paid into a state unemployment fund. From January 1, 1983, and thereafter, the term \"wages\" does not include remuneration of more than seven thousand dollars paid in a calendar year to an individual employee by his employer, or the employer's predecessor, for employment during that calendar year, unless additional remuneration is subject to a federal law which imposes a tax against which credit may be taken for contributions required to be paid into a state unemployment fund. the term, wages, means remuneration paid in a calendar year to an employee by an employer or the employer's predecessor for employment during any calendar year. The term includes remuneration in addition to the wages defined in this section which are subject to a federal law imposing a tax against which credit may be taken for contributions required to be paid into a state unemployment fund. The term, wages, does not include remuneration of more than: (1) Seven thousand dollars, from January 1, 1983, to December 31, 2006, inclusive; and (2) Eight thousand five hundred dollars, from January 1, 2007 to December 31, 2007, inclusive. For calendar year 2008 and each calendar year thereafter, the term does not include remuneration of more than the amount defined as wages for the prior calendar year plus the percentage increase in the average annual wage in covered employment in South Dakota for the fiscal year preceding the calendar year. The amount so determined shall be rounded to the nearest one hundred dollars. In this section, the term , \" employment \" , includes service constituting employment under any unemployment compensation law of another state. For the purposes of this section, the average annual wage in covered employment in South Dakota is computed by dividing the sum of the total wages in covered employment, as reported to the department for the preceding fiscal year, by the average number of workers in covered employment and rounded to the nearest cent. Section 2. That \u00a7 61-5-18.14 be amended to read as follows: 61-5-18.14.

Following December 31, 2008, and each year thereafter, the department shall determine the interest due and owing on each negative balance account. Interest shall be owed only if the employer had a negative account balance on the computation date used for the annual interest calculation and a negative account balance on the ending date of each of the seven preceding calendar quarters. The interest rate shall be the average of the quarterly interest rates paid by the United States Treasury on unemployment insurance trust fund reserves in the calendar year ending on the interest calculation date. The interest rate so determined will be applied to the amount by which the negative account increased from December 31, 2006, or from the date the employer became subject to this title if later, to the computation date used for the interest calculation date for the year. Interest due and owing shall be paid in equal quarterly payments during the year following the computation date, with each payment due on the last day of each quarter. The computation date and experience rating account balance used to determine contribution rates shall be used in the application of this section. No payments may be credited to the experience rating account of the employer. The terms and conditions of this title which apply to the payment and collection of contributions also apply to the payment and collection of the negative account interest assessments. Section 5. That \u00a7 61-5-23 be amended to read as follows: 61-5-23.

The increased rate shall be one-tenth of one percent if the balance in the fund is one hundred percent or more but less than one hundred fifty percent of the highest amount appearing in Column A. However under no circumstances may any employer be required to pay contributions at a rate including the adjustment percentage, of more than ten and one-half percent. However, the increased contribution rates do not apply to wages paid from July 1, 2006, to June 30, 2009, inclusive, unless the amount in the fund at the end of any quarter in that period is two million dollars or less."}, {"bill_id": 20455, "bill_version_id": 106823, "bill_version": "House Commerce and Energy Engrossed", "bill_version_date": "2006-01-19T13:43:12-06:00", "bill_text": "FOR AN ACT ENTITLED, An Act to change the unemployment insurance wage base and contribution rates and to assess interest on negative employer accounts under certain circumstances.
