BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 31-11-5 be repealed. 31-11-5. The county highway superintendent shall have charge of all road construction and maintenance in the county, subject to the approval of the board of county commissioners. In case of a disagreement between the county superintendent of highways and the board of county commissioners an appeal may be taken to the Transportation Commission, whose decision shall be final. Section 2. That \u00a7 31-19-50 be repealed. 31-19-50. If by order of the Department of Transportation by agreement with any county, it shall be necessary for the board of county commissioners to acquire any land or lands outside of the limits of any public highway in order to comply with any order issued by the department for the purpose of making a safe and proper grade, widening or changing or relocating any section of the state trunk highway system, the board of county commissioners shall proceed to acquire title to any such land or lands, or right-of-way in the name of and for the use of the state for highway purposes. Such land or lands or right-of-way may be acquired either by purchase or condemnation and the proceedings shall be by resolution duly adopted and recorded in the office of the county auditor. Section 3. That \u00a7 31-19-51 be repealed. 31-19-51. In case the owner of any land or lands referred to in \u00a7 31-19-50 and the board of county commissioners cannot agree upon the price to be paid for any such land or lands by the county, the board of county commissioners may appoint a board of appraisers of three disinterested persons, or if demanded by the owner within ten days after the service of the resolution to condemn, the board of county commissioners shall appoint one disinterested person, the owner another, and these two shall appoint a third not resident of the township in which said land or lands are situated, who shall make a careful inspection of such land or lands and fix a value upon the same, taking into consideration any benefits or damages that may accrue to such owner by the acquiring and use of any such land or lands. Such appraisal duly made and filed in the office of the county auditor shall be presumed to be the true value thereof and shall be the amount of the payment therefor by the board of county commissioners unless changed by the judgment of a jury in the circuit court. Section 4. That \u00a7 31-19-52 be repealed. 31-19-52. Immediately after appraisal has been made by the appraisers appointed as provided in \u00a7 31-19-51 the county auditor shall deliver a copy of such appraisal to the owner of such land or lands so appraised. If the owner of such land or lands is not a resident of the county and unknown to the county auditor he shall publish the result of such appraisal in the official newspapers of the county in two issues thereof, setting forth that such appraisal of such land or lands is in pursuance of proceedings to acquire such land or lands for highway right-of-way or construction purposes and that the county is prepared to and will pay the amount fixed by such board of appraisers for such land or lands to be used for such purposes. Upon completion of these proceedings the board of county commissioners may proceed to use such land or lands for highway purposes. Section 5. That \u00a7 31-19-53 be repealed. 31-19-53. The award of damages pursuant to \u00a7 31-19-51 with settlement for any such land or lands shall be subject to appeal therefrom to the circuit court, and any person aggrieved by any award of damages made under the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 31-19-50 to 31-19-55, inclusive, for land taken for highway construction, change, or relocation purposes may appeal from such decision to the circuit court in the manner prescribed for appeal from other decisions of the board of county commissioners. An appeal so taken shall be docketed as in other cases pending in circuit courts and the case shall be heard and determined de novo. Section 6. That \u00a7 31-19-54 be repealed. 31-19-54. In the event any board of county commissioners within thirty days after notice or demand from the Department of Transportation pursuant to \u00a7 31-19-50 shall fail, refuse, or neglect to obtain or institute proper condemnation proceedings for the purpose of obtaining any lands or right-of-way of any section of any trunk highway to be constructed or improved or any necessary right-of-way for the purpose of making a safe and proper grade, change, or relocation, the department may acquire such necessary right-of-way either by purchase or condemnation. The title to such right-of-way shall be in the name of the state and the cost thereof shall be paid out of state highway funds. Section 7. That \u00a7 31-19-55 be repealed. 31-19-55. The proceedings prescribed in \u00a7\u00a7 31-19-50 to 31-19-54, inclusive, for acquiring lands for highway purposes by order of the Department of Transportation may also be followed in acquiring lands for highway purposes by the board of county commissioners when the construction, change, or relocation of a highway is wholly within the hands of the board of county commissioners and paid for by county funds. The same may apply to the board of township supervisors in the construction, change, or relocation of township highways."}, {"bill_id": 5643, "bill_version_id": 31080, "bill_version": "Enrolled",
