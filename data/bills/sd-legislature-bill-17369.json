BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That subdivision (2) of \u00a7 61-1-1 be amended to read as follows: (2) \"Base period,\" the first four out of the last five completed calendar quarters immediately preceding an individual's benefit year except as provided in section 2 of this Act . However, for an individual who fails to meet the qualifications of \u00a7 61-6-7 due to the receipt of temporary total disability payments under worker's compensation, the base period is the first four of the last five completed quarters preceding the disability if a claim for unemployment benefits is filed within twenty-four months of the date on which the individual's disability was incurred; Section 2. That chapter 61-1 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: For benefit years effective on or after the effective date of this Act, if an individual does not have sufficient wages in the base period as defined in \u00a7 61-1-1 to qualify for benefits pursuant to this title, the individual's alternative base period shall be the last four completed calendar quarters immediately preceding the first day of the individual's benefit year if the period qualifies the individual for benefits under this title. The department shall promulgate rules pursuant to chapter 1-26 for obtaining wage information if wage information for the most recent quarter of the alternate base period is not available to the department from regular quarterly reports of wage information that is systematically accessible. Wages that fall within the base period of claims established under this section are not available for reuse in qualifying for any subsequent benefit years. In the case of a combined-wage claim pursuant to the arrangement approved by the United States secretary of labor, the base period is that base period applicable under the unemployment compensation law of the paying state."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 17369, "action_date": "2002-01-22T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 92570, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/92570.pdf", "status_text": "First read in Senate and referred to", "journal_page": 171, "committee_id_action": 769, "committee_id_assigned": 743, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 17369, "action_date": "2002-01-29T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 93109, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/93109.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 743, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 17369, "action_date": "2002-01-29T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 93109, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/93109.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to 36th legislative day", "journal_page": 273, "committee_id_action": 743, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 53727, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [2730, 2829, 2734, 2796], "Excused": [2791], "Nay": [2819, 2828]}}, {"bill_id": 17369, "action_date": "2002-01-29T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 93109, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/93109.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to 36th legislative day", "journal_page": 273, "committee_id_action": 743, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 53727, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [2730, 2829, 2734, 2796], "Excused": [2791], "Nay": [2819, 2828]}}]}
