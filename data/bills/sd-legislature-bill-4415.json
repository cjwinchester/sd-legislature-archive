The board shall consider the following factors when making that determination: (1) Has the county or municipality adopted a formula to reduce property taxation for the project for five years under the discretionary formula pursuant to \u00a7 10-6-35.2; (2) Has the county or municipality approved a tax incremental district pursuant to chapter 11-9 for the area where the project will be located; (3) Has the municipality approved a municipal sales tax refund pursuant \u00a7 10-52-10; (4) Economic activity that may occur in the community, area, and state; and (5) Criteria established by rules promulgated pursuant to section 35 of this Act. Section 28. Upon approval of the application by the Board of Economic Development, GOED shall issue a permit entitling the person to submit an affidavit for reinvestment payment as provided by section 29 of this Act. The permit and reinvestment payment is assignable and transferable and may be used as collateral or security pursuant to chapter 57A-9. If the initial permit holder entity reorganizes into a new entity, the new entity shall file with GOED an amended application within sixty days of the reorganization. If either the permit or reinvestment payment, or both, is assigned or transferred to another entity, such entity shall file with GOED an amended application within sixty days. Section 29. Any person that has timely filed the application and is holding a permit issued by GOED, and has completed the project, shall file an affidavit for reinvestment payment with GOED. The affidavit for reinvestment payment shall contain the following information: (1) The project owner's name and contact information; (2) The general description of the project; (3) The date of completion of the project; (4) The final project costs; (5) The amount of South Dakota sales tax, use tax, and contractors excise tax paid for the construction of the project; (6) The location of the project; (7) The legal description of the project location; (8) A list of the contractors and subcontractors that performed work on the project; (9) If the reinvestment payment was assigned or transferred, the name and address of the person to whom the reinvestment payment has been assigned or transferred; and (10) Any other information that GOED may require. The affidavit for reinvestment payment shall be on a form prescribed by the commissioner. The affidavit for reinvestment payment shall be signed by the project owner and signed under oath before a notary public. No affidavit for reinvestment payment may include more than one project. Section 30. The affidavit for reinvestment payment as required by section 29 of this Act shall be filed no later than six months after the completion of the project. If the affidavit for reinvestment payment is not timely filed, the person is ineligible for any reinvestment payment provided by sections 24 to 36, inclusive, of this Act. If the person filing the affidavit for reinvestment payment knowingly makes any material false statement or report in the affidavit for reinvestment payment, the person is ineligible for any reinvestment payment provided by sections 24 to 36, inclusive, of this Act. No project costs that occur after three years from the construction date are eligible to be included in the final project cost determination for any reinvestment payment provided by sections 24 to 36, inclusive, of this Act, unless an extension is granted at the sole discretion of the board, which extension may not extend beyond four years from the construction date. Section 31. After the timely receipt of a completed affidavit for reinvestment payment, within ninety days GOED shall make payment from the reinvestment fund to the project owner based upon the amount and terms approved by the board as a reinvestment payment. If GOED requests additional documents or information from the project owner, the ninety day period begins to run from the date of receipt of the additional documents or information. GOED shall tender the reinvestment payment by electronic funds transfer. Section 32. There is hereby created the reinvestment payment fund for the sole purpose of making reinvestment payments pursuant to the provisions of sections 24 to 36, inclusive, of this Act. If the Board of Economic Development approves a reinvestment payment pursuant to the provisions of sections 24 to 36, inclusive, of this Act, the Department or Revenue shall deposit a portion or all of the sales and use taxes paid by the project owner up to a maximum amount of the reinvestment payment approved by the board. The funds in the reinvestment project fund are continuously appropriated to GOED to make reinvestment payments pursuant to sections 24 to 36, inclusive, of this Act. If any money deposited in the fund and set aside for a specific reinvestment payment is in excess of the final reinvestment payment or the specific project becomes ineligible for the reinvestment payment, such money shall be deposited into the general fund. Interest earned on money in the fund shall be deposited into the general fund. Section 33. If the project is located on land that is included within the agreement area of a sales and use tax collection agreement entered into by the state and an Indian tribe pursuant to chapter 10-12A, the board may only approve a reinvestment payment that is equal to or less than the amount of funds attributable to the project that the Department of Revenue retains pursuant to the terms of the tax collection agreement. Section 34. The name of any person that receives a reinvestment payment as provided by sections 24 to 36, inclusive, of this Act and the amount of the reinvestment payment is public information and shall be available and open to public inspection as provided in \u00a7 1-27-1. The following information shall be made public on the GOED website as public information: (1) An estimated number of the full-time jobs to be created by the project; (2) An estimated average wage of the full-time jobs; (3) A list of all the local government tax mechanisms and state economic tools, loans, or grants provided to the project; (4) An estimate of the property taxes to be paid by the project; and (5) A statement of why the project would not have occurred in South Dakota without the reinvestment payment. Section 35. The board may promulgate rules, pursuant to chapter 1-26, concerning the procedures and forms for applying for and receiving the reinvestment payment, the requirements necessary to qualify for the reinvestment payment, and the criteria to evaluate projects submitting applications. Section 36. No person who works for a project may be employed for a commission dependent in any manner upon the approval of any government grants, loans, or reinvestment payments that the person obtains for the project. Section 37. That \u00a7 13-13-10.1 be amended to read as follows: 13-13-10.1.

When counting a student who meets these criteria in its general enrollment average daily membership, the receiving district may begin the enrollment on the first day of attendance. The district of residence prior to the custodial transfer may not include students who meet these criteria in its general enrollment average daily membership after the student ceases to attend school in the resident district; (2) \"Adjusted average daily membership,\" calculated as follows: (a) For districts with an average daily membership of two hundred or less, multiply 1.2 times the average daily membership; (b) For districts with an average daily membership of less than six hundred, but greater than two hundred, raise the average daily membership to the 0.8293 power and multiply the result times 2.98; (c) For districts with an average daily membership of six hundred or more, multiply 1.0 times their average daily membership; (2A) \"Fall enrollment,\" the number of kindergarten through twelfth grade students enrolled in all schools operated by the school district on the last Friday of September of the current school year minus the number of students for whom the district receives tuition, except nonresident students who are in the care and custody of a state agency and are attending a public school and students for whom tuition is being paid pursuant to \u00a7 13-28-42.1, plus the number of students for whom the district pays tuition. When computing state aid to education for a school district under the foundation program pursuant to \u00a7 13-13-73, the secretary of the Department of Education shall use either the school district's fall enrollment or the average of the school district's fall enrollment from the previous two years, whichever is higher; (2B) Repealed by SL 2010, ch 84, \u00a7 1. (2C) \"Small school adjustment,\" calculated as follows: (a) For districts with a fall enrollment of two hundred or less, multiply 0.2 times $4,237.72; (b) For districts with a fall enrollment of greater than two hundred, but less than six hundred, multiply the fall enrollment times negative 0.0005; add 0.3 to that result; and multiply the sum obtained times $4,237.72; The determination of the small school adjustment for a school district may not include any students residing in a residential treatment facility when the education program is operated by the school district; (2D) \"Limited English proficiency (LEP) adjustment,\" is calculated as follows: (a) Multiply 0.25 times the per student allocation; and (b) Multiply the product obtained in subsection (a) times the number of kindergarten through twelfth grade students who, in the prior school year, scored below level four on the state-administered language proficiency assessment as required in the state's consolidated state application pursuant to 20 USC 6311(b)(7) as of January 1, 2013; (3) \"Index factor,\" is the annual percentage change in the consumer price index for urban wage earners and clerical workers as computed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States Department of Labor for the year before the year immediately preceding the year of adjustment or three percent, whichever is less; (4) \"Per student allocation,\" for school fiscal year 2012 is $4,389.95.

Section 38. That \u00a7 13-13-73 be amended to read as follows: 13-13-73. The secretary of the Department of Education shall compute state aid to education for each school district under the foundation program according to the following calculations: (1) Determine each school district's fall enrollment; (2) To arrive at the local need per district: (a) Multiply the per student allocation by the fall enrollment; (b) Multiply the small school adjustment, if applicable, by the fall enrollment; and (c) Calculate the limited English proficiency (LEP) adjustment pursuant to subdivision (2D), if applicable; and (d) Add the product of subsection (a) to the product of subsection (b) and to the calculation in subsection (c); (3) State aid is (a) local need minus local effort, or (b) zero if the calculation in (a) is a negative number; (4) If the state aid appropriation for the general support of education is in excess of the entitlement provided for in this section and the entitlement provided for in \u00a7 13-13-85, the excess shall be used to fund any shortfall of the appropriation as provided for in \u00a7 13-37-36.3. The secretary shall report to the Governor by January seventh of each year, the amount of state aid necessary to fully fund the general aid formula in the current year. If a shortfall in the state aid appropriation for general education exists that cannot be covered by \u00a7 13-37-45, the Governor shall inform the Legislature and provide a proposal to eliminate the shortfall. Section 39. The provisions of sections 37 and 38 of this Act are effective on July 1, 2013. Section 40.
