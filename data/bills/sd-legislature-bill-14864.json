WHEREAS, South Dakota has traditionally been railroad poor due to the fact that the transcontinentals were built around the Great Sioux Reservation that occupied most of western South Dakota during the late nineteenth century; and WHEREAS, economical and timely rail transport is of critical importance in a state heavily dependent on agriculture, livestock raising, lumbering, and mining; and WHEREAS, the national railroad system has been steadily losing traffic to motorized transport throughout the current century; and WHEREAS, South Dakota was acutely threatened by the rail crisis in the 1970s and 1980s when several major carriers withdrew service on important lines; and WHEREAS, the Dakota, Minnesota & Eastern Railroad stepped forward at that time to pick up the slack and save a large portion of the threatened track and service; and WHEREAS, the Dakota, Minnesota & Eastern Railroad has proposed and initiated plans for expansion which could be vital to the long-term stabilization of the state's rail system; and WHEREAS, the Dakota, Minnesota & Eastern Railroad has recently concluded a wide- ranging agreement with the Landowner Advisory Board composed of ranchers from South Dakota and Wyoming which will facilitate an ambitious expansion of track and service that bodes well for all South Dakota rail users: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the House of Representatives of the Seventy- fourth Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the Senate concurring therein, that the Dakota, Minnesota & Eastern Railroad and the Landowner Advisory Board be heartily applauded for their successful negotiations and for the goodwill displayed on both sides."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 14864, "action_date": "1999-02-12T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 81964, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/81964.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 623, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 14864, "action_date": "1999-02-19T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 81967, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/81967.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 623, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 14864, "action_date": "1999-02-19T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 81967, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/81967.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to 41st legislative day", "journal_page": 635, "committee_id_action": 623, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 41828, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [2208, 2228, 2232, 2245, 2247, 2254, 2257, 2262, 2287, 2214], "Nay": [2240], "Excused": [2282, 2266]}}]}
