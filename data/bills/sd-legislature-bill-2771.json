(2C) \"Small school adjustment,\" calculated as follows: (a) For districts with a fall enrollment of two hundred or less, multiply 0.2 times $4,237.72 $3,813.95; (b) For districts with a fall enrollment of greater than two hundred, but less than six hundred, multiply the fall enrollment times negative 0.0005; add 0.3 to that result; and multiply the sum obtained times $4,237.72 $3,813.95; The determination of the small school adjustment for a school district may not include any students residing in a residential treatment facility when the education program is operated by the school district; (3) \"Index factor,\" is the annual percentage change in the consumer price index for urban wage earners and clerical workers as computed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States Department of Labor for the year before the year immediately preceding the year of adjustment or three percent, whichever is less; (4) \"Per student allocation,\" for school fiscal year 2011 is $4,804.60. Each school fiscal year thereafter, the per student allocation is the previous fiscal year's per student allocation increased by the index factor; (5) \"Local need,\" is the sum of: (a) The per student allocation multiplied by the fall enrollment; and (b) The small school adjustment, if applicable, multiplied by the fall enrollment; (6) \"Local effort,\" the amount of ad valorem taxes generated in a school fiscal year by applying the levies established pursuant to \u00a7 10-12-42; (7) \"General fund balance,\" the unreserved fund balance of the general fund, less general fund exclusions plus, beginning with transfers made in fiscal year 2001, any transfers out of the general fund for the previous school fiscal year; (8) \"General fund balance percentage,\" is a school district's general fund balance divided by the school district's total general fund expenditures for the previous school fiscal year, the quotient expressed as a percent; (9) \"General fund base percentage,\" is the lesser of: (a) The general fund balance percentage as of June 30, 2011; or (b) The maximum allowable percentage for that particular fiscal year as stated in this subsection. For fiscal year 2008, the maximum allowable percentage is one hundred percent; for fiscal year 2009, eighty percent; for fiscal year 2010, sixty percent; for fiscal years 2011 to 2014, inclusive, forty percent for each fiscal year; for fiscal year 2015 and subsequent fiscal years, twenty-five percent.
