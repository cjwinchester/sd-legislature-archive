BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 13-55-62 be amended to read as follows: 13-55-62. There is hereby created a Teach for America grant program within the Department of Education. The purpose of the grant program is to provide funding to Teach for America, a nonprofit organization that provides alternative teacher recruitment and placement in public schools in which a majority of the students are from low-income households. Through the grant program, the state will partner with private contributors to fund an expansion of the Teach for America program in the state that will allow the number of teachers placed to grow from fifty-seven to one hundred by 2015 to meet the demand. The expansion will allow Teach for America to positively impact two-thirds of the Native American students on reservations in the state and more than half of the Native American students statewide, and to strengthen its efforts to improve the academic achievement of low-income, Native American students and to increase the educational opportunities afforded them. Funding through the grant program shall be provided to Teach for America over a period of four fiscal years beginning on July 1, 2012. Funding appropriated for the grant program pursuant to this Act shall be provided to Teach for America over a period of four fiscal years beginning on July 1, 2015. The amount of the grants provided pursuant to this section and \u00a7 13-55-63 shall be based upon the amount of matching funds received by Teach for America from private contributors, but the total amount of all grants provided may not exceed the total amount of money appropriated for the grant fund. Section 2. There is hereby appropriated from the general fund the sum of five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000), or so much thereof as may be necessary, to the Department of Education to provide funding for the Teach for America grant program established in \u00a7 13-55-62. Section 3. The secretary of education shall approve vouchers and the state auditor shall draw warrants to pay expenditures authorized by this Act. Section 4. Any amounts appropriated in this Act not lawfully expended or obligated by June 30, 2016, shall revert in accordance with the procedures prescribed in chapter 4-8."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 6544, "action_date": "2015-01-28T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 34034, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/34034.pdf", "status_text": "First read in Senate and referred to", "journal_page": 218, "committee_id_action": 284, "committee_id_assigned": 283, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 6544, "action_date": "2015-02-06T08:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 34347, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/34347.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 283, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 6544, "action_date": "2015-02-12T08:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 34734, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/34734.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 283, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 6544, "action_date": "2015-02-20T08:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 35121, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/35121.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 283, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 6544, "action_date": "2015-02-20T08:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 35367, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/35367.pdf", "status_text": "Motion to amend", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 283, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 6544, "action_date": "2015-02-20T08:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 35367, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/35367.pdf", "status_text": "Tabled", "journal_page": 470, "committee_id_action": 283, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 18872, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [868, 855, 893, 903, 942, 892, 886], "Nay": [876, 873]}}]}
