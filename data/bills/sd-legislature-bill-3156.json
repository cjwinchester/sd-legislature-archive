BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 9-43-1 be repealed. 9-43-1. The entire cost of a public improvement or any part thereof may be advanced, and the portion of such cost to be paid by the municipality either as the public assumption of a part of the cost, the payment of an assessment levied against property owned by the municipality or the United States, or because of the municipality being required to purchase any past due unpaid special improvement bonds issued in accordance with the provisions of \u00a7 9-43-62, may be paid out of the funds of the municipality not otherwise appropriated; or the governing body may issue general obligation bonds for such purposes to an amount not exceeding the limitations upon net indebtedness for the purpose of such improvement as prescribed in S.D. Const., Art. XIII, \u00a7 4, after authorization by the voters and in the form and manner provided for other general obligation bonds. Section 2. That \u00a7\u00a7 9-43-5 to 9-43- 41, inclusive, \u00a7\u00a7 9-43-42 to 9-43-53, inclusive, and \u00a7\u00a7 9-43-54 to 9-43-74, inclusive, be repealed. Section 3. For purposes of sections 3 to 67, inclusive, of this Act, the term, local improvement, means the process of building, altering, repairing, improving, or demolishing any local infrastructure facility, including any structure, building, or other improvement of any kind to real property, the cost of which is payable from taxes or special assessments. Section 4. Any municipality may make assessments for local improvements on property adjoining or benefiting from the improvements, collect the assessments in the manner provided by law, and fix, determine, and collect penalties for nonpayment of any special assessments. Any municipality may construct and finance combined improvements if the benefits of each improvement will accrue to the same lots and tracts of land within the municipality. Any municipality may accept and consider petitions by owners of property within the municipality for local improvements to be specially assessed against the properties benefiting from the improvement. Section 5. The entire cost of a local improvement or any part of the improvement may be paid out of the funds of the municipality not otherwise appropriated, paid by funds received through any authorized financing mechanism, or the governing body may issue general obligation bonds in accordance with the provisions of chapter 6-8B. Section 6. After investigation by the governing body to determine the amount of benefit from construction of the local improvement to the lots and tracts fronting or abutting the improvement, the amount to be assessed against each lot for any local improvement for which special assessments are to be levied may be determined by dividing the total cost of the improvement by the number of feet fronting or abutting the improvement, and the quotient may be assessed per front foot upon the property fronting or abutting the improvement. If any of the property assessed is outside of municipal boundaries, the amount levied and assessed may not be collected unless the property has been annexed into the municipality. Section 7. In lieu of the method prescribed in section 6 of this Act, the governing body may provide by resolution that the costs of the local improvement shall be assessed against all lots and tracts according to the benefits determined by the governing body to accrue to each lot and tract from the construction of the improvement. In such event the governing body shall make an investigation and shall determine the amount in which each lot and tract will be specially benefitted by the construction of the improvement and shall assess against each lot and tract the amount, not exceeding the special benefit, as is necessary to pay its just portion of the total cost of the work to be assessed. Section 8. The total benefit of the local improvement may not be deemed to be less than the total cost of the improvement, including the contract price and all the engineering, inspection, publication, fiscal, legal, and other expenses incidental to the improvement. Section 9. If the governing body deems it necessary that a local improvement to be financed in total or in part by special assessment be constructed or maintained, it shall cause plans and specifications showing the location, arrangement, form, size, and materials to be used in the construction to be prepared by the city engineer or other competent person. The plans and specifications shall be filed in the office of the finance officer and available for examination by any interested party. Section 10. If the governing body deems it necessary that a local improvement to be financed in total or in part by special assessment be constructed or maintained, and after plans and specifications have been filed with the finance officer, the governing body shall draft a proposed resolution of necessity for the improvement and shall schedule a public hearing on the resolution. The proposed resolution of necessity shall include the general nature of the proposed improvement, the material to be used or materials from which a choice may be made, an estimate of the total cost or cost per linear foot, a description of the classes of lots to be assessed and of the method of apportioning the benefits to the lots. If it is deemed expedient for the municipality to assume and pay any portion of the cost of the improvement, the proposed resolution may so provide, or the portion to be assumed may be provided by a subsequent resolution. The proposed resolution may provide that the municipality will pay any definite, specified portion or all of the cost of the improvements in street and alley intersections. The proposed resolution may provide that the municipality will pay any definite, specified portion or all of the cost of improvements fronting or abutting on the side of a corner lot, or it may provide that that portion of the cost may be spread as an area tax on the properties benefitting from the improvement. The proposed resolution of necessity shall state that details, plans, and specifications may be reviewed at the finance office during regular office hours. Multiple improvements may be embraced by one resolution of necessity if the general nature of each improvement is stated. Section 11. The notice of hearing on the proposed resolution of necessity shall contain the time and place of the hearing and shall state that the governing body will consider any objections to the proposed resolution by owners of the property liable to be assessed. Notice of hearing on the proposed resolution of necessity shall be published once, not less than ten nor more than twenty days before the hearing on the resolution of necessity. Section 12. In addition to the published notice, the governing body, not less than ten nor more than twenty days before the hearing on the adoption of the proposed resolution of necessity, shall cause personal notice to be mailed by first class or certified mail to each person owning property liable to be assessed for the improvement, as shown by records kept by the director of equalization. The mailed notice shall contain a copy of the notice of hearing and the proposed resolution of necessity. Section 13. At the time and place of the hearing required by section 10 of this Act, the governing body shall consider any objections to the proposed resolution and may adopt the resolution, with or without amendment. No amendment may be made affecting property of any class not included in the original proposed resolution unless the owner of that property has been given the notice and opportunity to be heard as provided by sections 10 to 12, inclusive, of this Act. Section 14. Twenty days after publication of the adopted resolution of necessity, unless the referendum is invoked or unless a written protest is filed with the finance officer signed by the owners of more than fifty-five percent of the frontage of the property to be assessed, the governing body may cause the local improvement to be made, may contract for the improvement, and may levy and collect special assessments as provided in sections 3 to 67, inclusive, of this Act. Section 15. At any time after the execution of any contract for any local improvement for which special assessments are to be levied, the governing body may cause to be made and filed in the office of the finance officer an assessment roll showing: (1) The name of the owner of each lot to be assessed as shown by the assessment roll of the county director of equalization; (2) The legal description of each parcel of land to be assessed. The division by deeds of platted lots shall be recognized. The legal description of lands included in the assessment roll shall be taken as of the date of the adoption of the resolution of necessity; (3) The amount assessed against each lot. Section 16. Wherever the term, lot, appears in sections 3 to 67, inclusive, of this Act, it shall be construed to include tracts or other parcels of land. Section 17. If the assessment is payable in installments, the special assessment roll shall specify the number of installments, the rate of interest that deferred installments shall bear, that the whole assessment or any installment may be paid at any time, and that all installments paid before their respective due dates are deemed paid in inverse order of their due dates. Section 18. Upon the filing of the assessment roll with the finance officer, the governing body shall fix a time and place for hearing on the assessment roll. The finance officer shall publish a notice of the time and place of hearing in the official newspaper not less than ten nor more than twenty days before the date set for the hearing. The notice shall, in general terms, describe the improvement for which the special assessment is levied, the time and place of the hearing, and that the roll will be open for public inspection at the office of the finance officer and shall refer to the special assessment roll for further particulars. In addition to the publication of the notice of hearing, the finance officer shall mail a copy of the notice, by first class or certified mail, addressed to the owner or owners of any property to be assessed for the improvement at the address shown by the records of the director of equalization. The mailing may not be less than ten nor more than twenty days before the date set for the hearing. Section 19. At the time and place fixed for the hearing, the governing body shall meet to consider the assessment roll and hear any objections. At the hearing, the governing body may approve, equalize, amend, or reject the assessment roll. Section 20. If the governing body rejects the assessment roll, a new one may be made and filed, and notice and hearing shall be held as provided in section 18 of this Act. Section 21. If the governing body equalizes or amends the assessment roll, a list of all items of assessment changed or amended shall be published and notice and hearing shall be held as provided in section 18 of this Act. Section 22. After any corrections in the assessment roll have been made, the governing body by resolution shall approve and levy the assessment, describing the assessment and the local improvement, and providing the dates of the official approval of the assessment roll. Section 23. The resolution approving the assessment roll shall also state under which plan the assessment and installments thereof shall be paid as provided by section 30 of this Act. Section 24. The decision of a municipal governing body upon a special assessment roll may be appealed to circuit court. The appeal shall be made within twenty days after publication of a notice that the resolution confirming the special assessment roll has been adopted by filing written notice of the appeal with the municipal finance officer and the clerk of the circuit court in the county in which the real property is situated. The notice of appeal shall describe the property and set forth the objections of the appellant to the special assessment. Section 25. Each item of assessment shall be numbered consecutively by the finance officer without regard to date, character of local improvement, or description of property. No number may be duplicated. Section 26. The finance officer shall prepare a special record which shall contain the following: (1) A record of all special assessments; (2) The consecutive number of the item; (3) The date the assessment is due; (4) The name of the property owner as provided by the director of equalization; (5) The legal description of the property; (6) The amount assessed against each lot; (7) The character of the improvement for which the assessment is made; and (8) The date of payment of each assessment or installment that is paid to the municipality. The finance officer shall include in the special record a suitable index to the real property against which special assessments have been levied. The finance officer may destroy any record as provided by chapter 1-27. Section 27. The municipal finance officer shall immediately mail to the owners of each lot, parcel, or piece of land as shown by the special assessment roll, a notice specifying the amount of the assessment, the number of installments, the date of the approval of the assessment roll, and a statement that any number of the installments may be paid without interest at the office of the finance officer within thirty days from the date of approval of the roll, after which the unpaid balance will draw interest at the rate fixed by the governing body from the date of the approval of the assessment roll. Section 28. Any special assessment lawfully levied upon real property assessed pursuant to sections 3 to 67 of this Act, except land that is used for agricultural purposes as defined in \u00a7 10-6-31, is a continuing lien on the property as against all persons except the United States and this state. The lien shall continue for fifteen years from the date of the due date of the last installment. Section 29. A municipality may waive or reduce special assessments levied against owner-occupied single family dwellings if the head of the household is sixty-five years of age or older, or is disabled, or if the annual household income does not exceed the federal poverty level as updated annually on the Department of Social Services website. The terms used in this section are defined in \u00a7 10-18A-1. Section 30. All special assessments are payable under Plan One or Plan Two. Plan One--Collection by county treasurer. Plan Two--Collection by municipal finance officer. Before any contract is let or before bonds are issued for any local improvement for which special assessments are to be levied, the governing body shall provide by resolution or ordinance whether the assessments and installments are payable under Plan One or under Plan Two. The resolution or ordinance may provide for the assessment to be divided into any number of annual installments not exceeding forty. Section 31. The installments of each assessment under Plan One or Plan Two are due and payable, one on January first following the date of approval of the assessment roll, and one on January first of each succeeding year until the entire assessment is paid. The governing body shall fix the interest rate to be borne by unpaid installments. Section 32. Any assessment or installment under Plan One or Plan Two may be paid without interest to the municipal finance officer at any time within thirty days after the approval of the assessment roll. Thereafter, and before the due date of the first installment, the entire assessment remaining, or any number of installments, plus interest from the approval date to the date of payment may be paid to the municipal finance officer. After the due date of the first installment, if the installments that are due together with interest have been paid, any of the remaining installments not yet due may be paid without additional interest to the municipal finance officer. All installments paid before their respective due dates shall be paid in inverse order of their due dates. Section 33. Under Plan One, the assessment roll shall be delivered to the county auditor not later than November first next following the date of approval or at the expiration of the thirty-day period for prepayment without interest, whichever is later. Before delivering the assessment roll to the county auditor, the municipal finance officer shall cancel in inverse order of their due dates all installments of any assessment previously paid. After delivery of the assessment role to the county auditor, the municipal finance officer shall promptly notify the county auditor of all installments of assessments paid to the finance officer, and the auditor shall cancel the installments in inverse order of their due dates upon the assessment roll. Section 34. Under Plan Two, the finance officer shall deliver no later than November first to the county auditor of the county in which the property assessed is located, all special assessments remaining unpaid that have become delinquent on or before October first. The finance officer shall certify to the county auditor the original amount of the assessment or installment, the amount of accrued interest of the assessment, the name of the property owner as provided by the director of equalization, the character of the improvement for which the assessment was made, and the legal description of the property. The county auditor shall include the delinquent installment and accrued interest in the following year at the time the real property tax is paid and shall certify the installment and interest, together with the general taxes, to the county treasurer for collection in accordance with chapter 10-17. Section 35. No installment under Plan One may be paid to the municipal finance officer on or after January first after certification to the county auditor. Section 36. The county auditor shall include each installment under Plan One, unless advised by the finance officer of the municipality of the prior payment, in the taxes collectible in the year in which the installment is due, upon each parcel of land assessed, including interest upon that installment and all subsequent unpaid installments, at the rate fixed by the governing body. The county auditor shall certify the installment and interest, together with general taxes, to the county treasurer for collection in accordance with chapter 10-17. Section 37. The first installment under Plan One or Plan Two shall include interest from the date of approval of the assessment roll with the finance officer of the municipality to May first of the year in which the first installment is due. Each subsequent installment shall include one year's interest. Each of the installments, including interest as provided above, becomes delinquent on May first of the year in which the installment becomes due and shall have interest and penalty added each month at the same rate as provided in \u00a7 10-21-23 for delinquent real estate taxes. Section 38. The amount owing by any county, municipality, school district, or the state on account of assessments under Plan One or Plan Two against property within the municipality is payable by the treasurer of the governmental subdivision affected and shall be paid in like installments and with like interest and penalty as provided by law for other assessable real property. Section 39. All proceeds of special assessments under Plan One or delinquent Plan Two shall be paid to the finance officer of the municipality with the proceeds of other taxes. Section 40. If the combined taxes and assessment installments under Plan One or delinquent Plan Two are not paid, the parcel may be sold for all such taxes and assessments in accordance with chapter 10-23. There may be no separate sale as provided in \u00a7 10-23-1 but each parcel may be sold for both taxes and special assessments at a single sale, and redemption must be made by payment of all such special assessments and taxes. No tax sale relieves the land from liability for subsequent installments of special assessments. Section 41. If any such parcel is bid off in the name of the county, the bid shall include the amount of the delinquent installment of special assessments under Plan One or Plan Two. Any parcel may be discharged from the assessments at any time by paying to the county treasurer an amount equal to the then due and past-due installments, with accrued interest, penalty, and cost, if any, and paying to the municipal finance officer all subsequent installments without additional interest; at which point the parcel is relieved from the lien of the assessment. Section 42. The governing body may provide by ordinance or resolution for the issuance of negotiable bonds without a vote of the voters in an amount not exceeding the entire cost of the local improvement. The bonds shall be issued and sold as provided in chapter 6-8B. However, all bonds shall mature not later than one year after the maturity of the last assessment installment. A single issue may be sold to finance several improvements. Section 43. All amounts derived from special assessments for all local improvements shall be receipted into the account of the municipality. The proceeds of the sale of bonds issued pursuant to section 42 of this Act shall be placed into a fund and may be used only for the payment of the cost of the improvements. No moneys may be transferred out of the fund until all obligations that are charged against it have been discharged. Thereafter the governing body may transfer any unexpended and unobligated balance to the general fund. Section 44. If general obligation bonds are authorized, issued, and sold and the proceeds expended for the purpose of any local improvements of a type for which assessments may lawfully be levied, and if assessments have been levied on account of such improvements in the manner prescribed by law, special assessment bonds may be issued in anticipation of the collection of the assessments and may be transferred and appropriated to the debt service fund for the general obligation bonds, in reimbursement of all or any part of the sum expended. The amount of bonds transferred and appropriated may not exceed the sum expended, less any portion of the cost of the improvements to be assumed by the municipality. Any assessment bonds not transferred may be sold to third parties to provide additional moneys for financing the improvement. Section 45. All moneys received from collections of assessments for any local improvement wholly or partially financed from the proceeds of general obligation bonds shall be applied toward payment of the assessment bonds issued on account thereof, including those held in the debt service fund for the general obligation bonds, in the same manner as if all such assessment bonds were held by third persons. Section 46. The moneys collected in and held by the debt service fund for the general obligation bonds shall be applied toward the payment of the general obligation bonds and interest, and the governing body may annually cause to be certified to the county auditor the amount applied. The governing body may direct that the tax levy collectible in the following year for the payment of the bonds be reduced by an amount not exceeding the sum certified. However, the municipality remains obligated to levy general taxes sufficient, together with other resources of the debt service fund, for the prompt payment of all principal and interest due on the general obligation bonds. No assessment bond transferred to any debt service fund pursuant to the provisions of section 44 of this Act may subsequently be transferred to any other fund until the general obligation bonds for which the fund is maintained have been fully paid with interest. Section 47. The principal amount of all special assessment bonds that are held in any debt service fund and that are not in default as to either principal or interest, as well as other assets of the fund, are deductible from the principal amount of the outstanding general obligation bonds for which the debt service fund is maintained, in determining at any time the net indebtedness of the municipality represented by the general obligation bonds. Section 48. The governing body may by ordinance or resolution create and maintain special assessment accounts for financing local improvements for which assessments are to be levied. The governing body may provide moneys for the accounts in the annual appropriation ordinance or by transfer of unused balances from other funds in accordance with the provisions of chapter 9-21, or it may provide for the issuance of general obligation bonds for the purpose of creating and maintaining the account after authorization by the voters and in the manner provided by chapter 9-26. Creating and maintaining the account is deemed a single purpose in framing the question to be submitted to the voters. Section 49. A separate fund may be established to be used only to pay, in whole or in part, the cost of local improvements of the type for which the fund has been created and for which assessments are to be levied. Money in the fund may be used both to pay the portion of the cost of the improvement assumed by the municipality and to advance the portion of the cost ultimately to be paid from collections of assessments. Section 50. Special assessment bonds may be transferred and appropriated to the special assessment accounts in the same manner and to the same extent as provided in section 44 of this Act for the transfer of the bonds to general obligation bond sinking funds. All collections of assessments for assessment bonds transferred shall be held in and used only for the purposes of debt retirement. Section 51. If the governing body determines that the cash, assessment bonds, and any other investments held in the special assessment accounts are in excess of amounts required for financing contemplated future local improvements, it may transfer all or any part of the assets to the sinking fund for any outstanding general obligation bonds issued to create and maintain special assessments. The transfer is irrevocable, and the principal amount of all assessment bonds transferred that are not in default as to principal or interest, together with the other assets of the sinking fund, are deductible from the principal amount of the general obligation bonds in determining the net indebtedness of the municipality. Section 52. No special assessment moneys may be transferred to any other fund of the municipality until all general obligation bonds issued to create or maintain the special assessments have been fully paid with interest. Section 53. No injunction restraining the making of any local improvement under the provisions of this chapter may be issued after the letting of the contract. No action or proceedings may be commenced or maintained in any court attacking the validity of the proceedings for special assessments up to and including the approval of the assessment roll or questioning the amount of the assessment unless the action is commenced within twenty days after the publication of the resolution approving the assessment roll and notice that assessments are due and payable as provided in section 27 of this Act. Section 54. If any action or proceeding is commenced and maintained in any court to restrain the collection of any assessment levied for any municipal local improvement, to recover any such assessment previously paid, to recover the possession or title of any real property sold for such an assessment, to invalidate or cancel any deed or grant thereof for such an assessment, or to restrain or delay the payment of any such assessment, the true and just amount of the assessment due upon the property shall be ascertained and judgment shall be rendered for the assessment, making the assessment a lien upon the property and authorizing execution or process to issue for the collection of the assessment by a sale of the property. If in the opinion of the court the assessment has been rendered void or voidable by any act or omission, the court may order that a reassessment be made under the provisions of sections 62 and 63 of this Act. The court may require the payment of the assessment as a condition for granting such relief, or declare by its judgment that the assessment is a lien upon the property, and authorize the issuing of execution or proper process for its collection by a sale of the property, to the end that the whole matter may be adjudicated in the one action or proceeding and the proper proportion or ratio of the assessment be paid by the property owner. The cost of such an action or proceeding shall be taxed as the court may direct. Section 55. The governing body of any municipality may establish one or more districts for the construction and maintenance of local improvements. The governing body may establish or modify the boundary of the district, construct improvements or portions of improvements, and assess the cost of the improvement to the property within the district as provided in sections 3 to 67, inclusive, of this Act. Section 56. If the governing body deems it necessary to establish a local improvement district, the governing body shall have a plan of the district prepared by the city engineer or other competent person, showing the boundaries of the district and lots or parts of lots included in the district. The plan shall be filed in the office of the finance officer for public inspection. No district need be established for the purpose of constructing or maintaining any improvement. Section 57. Upon filing of the plan, a notice signed by the finance officer shall be published once stating that a plan for a public district, bounded as described in the notice and designated by number has been prepared and is on file in the office of the finance officer. The notice shall state that all persons owning property or interested in any real estate in the district may examine the notice during regular office hours and may file objections within ten days after the publication of the notice, and that on the date stated the governing body will hold a public hearing at a place named to consider any objections, at which time all persons may be heard. The notice shall be published once, and the hearing may not be less than ten nor more than twenty days after publication. Section 58. At the hearing, the governing body shall consider any objections and may by resolution approve and adopt the proposed plan or change it in such manner as it may deem necessary. The governing body may adopt and approve the plan or may reject the plan and order a new plan prepared in accordance with sections 9 and 10 of this Act. Section 59. When a resolution adopting and approving a local improvement district plan takes effect, the plan shall be numbered and filed in the office of the finance officer and shall then constitute the plan of the district, and the lots contained in the district are liable to assessment for the construction of improvements within the district in the same manner as other assessed property not within a district and in accordance with the provisions of sections 3 to 67, inclusive, of this Act. Section 60. The total cost, or any portion of the cost that is assessable against all the real property within any district or area benefited by the local improvement, may be apportioned according to the benefits to accrue to each lot or tract, as determined by the governing body. In determining benefits to a district or area, the governing body shall determine the amount in which each lot or tract located within the district or area will be benefited by the construction of the improvement, and shall assess against each lot or tract that amount, not exceeding its special benefit, as is necessary to pay its just portion of the total cost of the work to be assessed. Section 61. If any lot is subject to assessment both as fronting and abutting property and as property within the district or area benefited by the local improvement, the sum of both assessments may be the amount to be stated in the assessment roll against each such lot. Section 62. If any special assessment for any local improvement is set aside for irregularity in the proceedings or declared void by reason of noncompliance with the provisions of law when ordering or letting the work or making the assessment, or if the collection of any portion of the assessment has been restrained or enjoined, or if any special assessment made upon any lot has been set aside or in any manner rendered or found to be ineffectual, the governing body may make a new assessment or reassessment. The governing body may collect the assessment or reassessment in the manner provided for the collection of the original assessment, to an amount not exceeding the amount of the original assessment, to bear interest at the rate provided by the governing body for unpaid installments of the original assessment from the date of approval of the assessment roll.
