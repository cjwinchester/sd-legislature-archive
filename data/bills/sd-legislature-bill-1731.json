That chapter 40-21 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Any person who violates any provision of chapters 40-20, 40-21, 40-22, or 40-29 is subject to an administrative fine to be imposed by the board, after notice and opportunity for hearing. The administrative fine is in addition to any criminal penalty and may not exceed five thousand dollars for each violation. In determining the amount of the fine, or the amount of a compromise settlement, upon finding a violation the board may consider the appropriateness of the fine to the number of head of livestock involved, the gravity of the violation, prior offenses and compliance history, the good faith of the person charged in attempting to achieve compliance, and such other matters as justice may require. Any fine collected pursuant to this Act shall be deposited in the livestock ownership inspection and theft prevention fund. 180 copies of this document were printed by the South Dakota Legislative Research Council at a cost of $.052 per page. .
