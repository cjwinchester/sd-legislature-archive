All costs associated with the investigation of fraudulent insurance acts, including those incurred by designees assisting or acting on behalf of the insurance fraud prevention unit, may be paid by the insurance fraud prevention unit fund. Section 7. If the insurance fraud prevention unit or its designees initiate civil action against any person and that person is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to have committed a fraudulent insurance act as set forth in section 2 of this Act, that person is subject to a civil penalty not to exceed five thousand dollars for the first violation, ten thousand dollars for the second violation, and fifteen thousand dollars for each subsequent violation. Civil penalties paid under this section shall be deposited in the insurance fraud prevention unit fund. An action under this section may be in lieu of criminal prosecution under the laws of this state and may not be commenced until after consultation with and written approval by the director and the attorney general. Section 8. Any costs associated with the administration and operation of the insurance fraud prevention unit, including salaries and the costs set forth in sections 5 and 6 of this Act, shall be paid from the insurance fraud prevention unit fund. All disbursements from the insurance fraud prevention unit fund shall be continuously appropriated. Section 9. Costs and expenses incurred in any investigation or other action arising out of a violation under this Act may be sought in any judgment or court decree. Any recovered costs, except civil or criminal penalties, shall be deposited by the unit or its designees in the insurance fraud prevention unit fund. The court may make such additional orders or judgments as may be necessary to restore to any person in interest any compensation which may have been acquired by means of any act prohibited in section 2 of this Act. Section 10. Notwithstanding any other section of this Act, the unit or its designees, and a person alleged to have committed a fraudulent insurance act as set forth in section 2, are not prohibited from entering into a written agreement upon commencement of a civil action in which the person alleged to have committed a fraudulent insurance act does not admit or deny the charges but consents to payment of the civil penalty. Section 11. For purposes of investigating and prosecuting insurance fraud, the insurance fraud prevention unit is subject to the provisions of this Act and the procedures set forth in Title 15 or Title 23A if applicable and if not in conflict with this Act. Section 12. All investigative records and files of the insurance fraud prevention unit are confidential. The investigative records of the insurance fraud prevention unit may not be released except pursuant to a court order. An investigator is not subject to subpoena in civil actions concerning any matter of which the investigator has knowledge regarding a pending insurance fraud investigation by the division, unless so ordered by the court. Section 13. Any person acting in good faith is immune from civil liability for filing a report with or for furnishing any information relating to suspected, anticipated, or completed fraudulent insurance acts to: (1) The Department of Commerce and Regulation and the director of insurance; (2) Any governmental agency established to detect and prevent fraud; (3) Law enforcement officials; (4) The Department of Labor; (5) Any insurer or insurance agent; (6) The National Association of Insurance Commissioners; and (7) Any nonprofit organization established to detect and prevent insurance fraud, if the organization is approved by the director pursuant to rules promulgated by the director under chapter 1-26 setting forth the standards, criteria, and procedures necessary to obtain approval. If a civil action is commenced against a person for damages related to the filing of a report or the furnishing of information under this section and the court determines that the person acted in good faith in filing the report or furnishing the information, the person filing the report or furnishing the information may recover costs or disbursements under chapter 15-17, including reasonable attorney's fees. If the trier of fact concludes that the person filing the report or furnishing the information was not acting in good faith, the person filing a civil action may recover costs or disbursements under chapter 15-17, including reasonable attorney's fees. This section does not abrogate or modify in any way any common law or statutory privilege or immunity. Section 14. The Division of Insurance shall assess each insurer holding a certificate of authority to transact the business of insurance in this state a fee of two hundred fifty dollars to be remitted and payable to the Division of Insurance to be deposited in a separate account, entitled the insurance fraud prevention unit fund. The Division of Insurance may not make an assessment until the fund falls below one hundred thousand dollars. If the fund falls below one hundred thousand dollars, the Division of Insurance shall notify each insurer of its payment obligation. Upon receipt of the notice of assessment from the Division of Insurance each insurer shall immediately make a two hundred fifty dollar payment to the fund. Failure of an insurer to submit full payment of the assessment to the division within twenty days of receipt of the notice of assessment, unless good cause is shown, may be grounds for administrative action to be taken by the division against an insurer. Section 15. The provisions of this Act do not: (1) Preempt the authority or relieve the duty of any other law enforcement agency to investigate, examine, and prosecute suspected violations of law; (2) Prevent or prohibit a person from voluntarily disclosing any information concerning insurance fraud to any law enforcement agency; (3) Limit any of the powers granted elsewhere by the laws of this state to the director of insurance or the Division of Insurance to investigate and examine possible violations of law and to take appropriate action; or (4) Limit any of the powers granted elsewhere by the laws of this state to any state agency to investigate and examine possible violations of law and to take appropriate action. Section 16. The Division of Insurance shall annually report to the Legislature concerning the activities of the insurance fraud prevention unit including the number and type of cases investigated, the outcome of such investigations, and costs and expenditures incurred during such investigations. Section 17. Each authorized insurer shall, every three years after the effective date of this Act, reevaluate its rates based upon the impact that fraud prevention has had upon its rates, considering the impact of this Act and the impact of any fraud prevention units of the insurer or other fraud prevention organization and appropriate accumulated data and, if justified by the insurer's actuary, reduce its rates. Section 18. That \u00a7 58-33-37 be amended to read as follows: 58-33-37. Any person who knowingly makes any false or fraudulent statement or representation with reference to any application for insurance shall be is guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor.
