WHEREAS, there are over forty million Americans, including millions of children, without health insurance at any given time, and over seventy-five percent of these people are uninsured for less than one year; and WHEREAS, the cost of insurance is the most common reason why people are uninsured, both temporarily and long-term, and affordability is the primary key to accessing health insurance; and WHEREAS, not all employers offer health insurance benefits, and those who do usually offer a limited number of choices of plans; and WHEREAS, employees who do not receive health insurance benefits from their employers, employees who prefer a health insurance plan not offered by their employers, and the self- employed who have no such choice, must purchase their insurance in the nongroup, individual health insurance market, where it is much more expensive; and WHEREAS, employers are able to deduct one hundred percent of the cost of providing health insurance to their employees, and this is a nontaxable benefit for employees; and WHEREAS, employees and self-employed individuals who purchase insurance in the nongroup market cannot deduct the full cost of premiums and, thus, are forced to pay their premiums with after-tax dollars; and WHEREAS, people who must pay for health insurance policies with after-tax dollars are twenty-four times more likely to be uninsured; and WHEREAS, this inequity is rooted in a skewed tax policy based not on the nature of the expense but rather on who funds the expense; and WHEREAS, the tax code should not extend favorable treatment to one class of taxpayer while denying the same treatment to others: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the House of Representatives of the Seventy- fourth Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the Senate concurring therein, that the Legislature urges the United States Congress to establish a fair and equitable taxation policy for health insurance premiums paid for by individuals. That policy shall promote the affordability and accessibility of health insurance for the self-employed and for individuals and families that either do not receive health insurance as a benefit of employment or prefer a health insurance plan not offered through employment, and shall promote the economic and medical well-being of American families, by establishing one hundred percent tax deductibility of health insurance premiums, without delay, for all Americans."}, {"bill_id": 14901, "bill_version_id": 81300, "bill_version": "Enrolled", "bill_version_date": "1999-03-03T00:00:00-06:00", "bill_text": "February 19, 1999 February 26, 1999"}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 14901, "action_date": "1999-02-19T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 81967, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/81967.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 623, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 14901, "action_date": "1999-02-19T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 81967, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/81967.pdf", "status_text": "Adopt Resolution", "journal_page": 634, "committee_id_action": 623, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 41827, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [2208, 2228, 2232, 2240, 2247, 2254, 2257, 2262, 2282, 2287, 2266, 2214], "Excused": [2245]}}, {"bill_id": 14901, "action_date": "1999-02-22T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 82132, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/82132.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to another day", "journal_page": 689, "committee_id_action": 628, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 14901, "action_date": "1999-02-23T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 82133, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/82133.pdf", "status_text": "Adopt Resolution", "journal_page": 700, "committee_id_action": 628, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 43505, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [2200, 2203, 2204, 2207, 2208, 2209, 2210, 2212, 2213, 2214, 2216, 2218, 2219, 2220, 2222, 2223, 2227, 2228, 2229, 2231, 2232, 2233, 2236, 2237, 2238, 2240, 2243, 2244, 2247, 2248, 2249, 2250, 2253, 2254, 2255, 2256, 2257, 2260, 2261, 2262, 2264, 2265, 2266, 2267, 2268, 2271, 2272, 2276, 2277, 2278, 2279, 2281, 2282, 2284, 2286, 2287, 2288, 2290, 2291, 2296, 2297, 2298, 2300, 2301, 2302, 2303, 2245], "Absent": [2211, 2273], "Excused": [2295]}}, {"bill_id": 14901, "action_date": "1999-02-26T07:30:00-06:00", "document_id": 82094, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/82094.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 611, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 14901, "action_date": "1999-02-26T07:30:00-06:00", "document_id": 82094, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/82094.pdf", "status_text": "Concur In resolution", "journal_page": 710, "committee_id_action": 611, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 42113, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [2224, 2270, 2246, 2259, 2292, 2230, 2299, 2283, 2241]}}, {"bill_id": 14901, "action_date": "1999-03-01T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 81778, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/81778.pdf", "status_text": "Remove from Consent Calendar", "journal_page": 722, "committee_id_action": 629, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 14901, "action_date": "1999-03-02T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 81779, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/81779.pdf", "status_text": "Concur In resolution", "journal_page": 737, "committee_id_action": 629, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 42208, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [2199, 2201, 2202, 2205, 2206, 2215, 2217, 2221, 2224, 2225, 2226, 2230, 2234, 2235, 2239, 2241, 2242, 2246, 2251, 2252, 2258, 2259, 2263, 2269, 2270, 2274, 2275, 2280, 2283, 2285, 2289, 2292, 2294, 2299], "Excused": [2293]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/14901"}
