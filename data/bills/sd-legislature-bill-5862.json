If the elected official whose removal is sought holds a statewide office or is a member of the Legislature or a judge of the circuit court, the petition shall be filed with the secretary of state. If the elected official's elected position is with a county, municipality, township, school district, or other political subdivision of the state, the petition shall be filed with the governing body of the governmental entity in which the elected official serves.
