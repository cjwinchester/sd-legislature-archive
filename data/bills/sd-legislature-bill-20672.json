BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 13-13-73 be amended to read as follows: 13-13-73. The secretary of the Department of Education shall compute state aid to education for each school district under the foundation program according to the following calculations: (1) Determine each school district's average daily membership; (2) Multiply the per student allocation by the adjusted average daily membership to arrive at the local need per district; (3) State aid is (a) local need minus local effort, or (b) zero if the calculation in (a) is a negative number provided no district's state aid may be less than fifty percent of local need ; (4) If the state aid appropriation for the general support of education is in excess of the entitlement provided for in this section, the excess shall be used to fund any shortfall of the appropriation as provided for in \u00a7\u00a7 13-37-36.3 and 13-37-43. The secretary shall report to the Governor by January seventh of each year, the amount of state aid necessary to fully fund the general aid formula in the current year. If a shortfall in the state aid appropriation for general education exists that cannot be covered by \u00a7 13- 37-45, the Governor shall inform the Legislature and provide a proposal to eliminate the shortfall. Section 2. That \u00a7 13-13-72 be amended to read as follows: 13-13-72. It is the policy of the Legislature that the appropriation for the state aid to education foundation program increase on an annual basis by the percentage increase in local need on an aggregate statewide basis so that the relative proportion of local need paid by local effort and state aid shall remain constant and so that no district's local effort levy exceed fifty percent of local need . Section 3. There is hereby appropriated from the state general fund, after the transfer of earnings from the education enhancement trust fund created in Article XII, section 6 of the South Dakota Constitution, the sum of thirty-one million seventy-two thousand four hundred one dollars ($ 31,072,401 ), or so much thereof as may be necessary, to the Department of Education for distribution to local school districts for reduction of property tax levies pursuant to this Act. Section 4. The secretary of the Department of Education shall approve vouchers and the state auditor shall draw warrants to pay expenditures authorized by this Act. Section 5. Any amounts appropriated in this Act not lawfully expended or obligated by June 30, 2007, shall revert in accordance with \u00a7 4-8-21."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 20672, "action_date": "2006-01-19T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 106850, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/106850.pdf", "status_text": "First read in Senate and referred to", "journal_page": 111, "committee_id_action": 894, "committee_id_assigned": 869, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 20672, "action_date": "2006-01-31T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 107557, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/107557.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 869, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 20672, "action_date": "2006-01-31T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 107557, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/107557.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to 36th legislative day", "journal_page": 271, "committee_id_action": 869, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 63862, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [3376, 3412, 3415, 3432, 3439, 3365, 3435]}}]}
