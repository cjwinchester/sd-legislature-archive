Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of South Dakota: Section 1. That \u00a7 29A-5-304 be AMENDED: 29A-5-304. Any individual who has sufficient capacity to form a preference may at any time nominate any individual or entity to act as his guardian or conservator. The nomination may be made in writing, by an oral request to the court, or may be proved by any other competent evidence. The court shall appoint the individual or entity so nominated if the nominee is otherwise eligible to act and would serve in the best interests of the protected person. If a person alleged to be in need of protection has designated an individual to serve as guardian or conservator under a validly executed legal instrument, including a power of attorney, and the court does not appoint the designated individual, the court shall issue written findings of fact and conclusions of law as to why the designated individual was not appointed. In the absence of an effective nomination by the protected person, the court shall appoint as guardian or conservator the individual or entity that will act in the protected person's best interests. In making that appointment, the court shall consider the proposed guardian's or conservator's geographic location, familial or other relationship with the protected person, ability to carry out the powers and duties of the office, commitment to promoting the protected person's welfare, any potential conflicts of interest, and the recommendations of the spouse, the parents or other interested relatives, whether made by will or otherwise. The court may appoint more than one guardian or conservator and need not appoint the same individual or entity to serve as both guardian and conservator. Section 2. That \u00a7 29A-5-309 be AMENDED: 29A-5-309. The court shall appoint an attorney for the person alleged to need protection, either upon the filing of the petition or at any time thereafter, if requested by the person alleged to need protection, if the person expresses a desire to contest the petition, or if the court determines that an appointment is otherwise needed to protect the person's interests. In appointing an attorney, the court shall consider any known preferences of the person alleged to need protection. If the person alleged to need protection is not or will not be represented by an attorney, the court shall either appoint a court representative to make an investigation and recommendation concerning the relief requested in the petition or shall order the person alleged to need protection to attend the hearing on the petition. If the basis of the petition is that the person alleged to need protection is an absentee, the court shall appoint an attorney if the court determines that an appointment is needed to protect the person's interests, but the court need not appoint a court representative or order attendance at the hearing. In addition to any court-ordered evaluation, a person alleged to need protection who is contesting a petition may obtain an evaluation at the person's own expense to be completed by a licensed healthcare professional of the person's choice in accordance with \u00a7 29A-5-306, which must be included in the file and considered by the court. Section 3. That \u00a7 29A-5-403 be AMENDED: 29A-5-403.

A guardian shall mail a copy of the report to the individuals and entities specified in \u00a7 29A-5-410 no later than fourteen days following its filing. Within sixty days of the filing of the annual report, any interested person may request a hearing on the report.
