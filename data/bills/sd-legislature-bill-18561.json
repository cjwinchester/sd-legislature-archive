For taxes payable in 1997 2005 , and each year thereafter, the total amount of revenue payable from taxes on real property within a taxing district, excluding the levy pursuant to \u00a7 10-13-36, may increase no more than the lesser greater of three four percent or the index factor, as defined in \u00a7 10-13-38, over the amount of revenue payable from taxes on real property in the preceding year, excluding the amount of taxes levied pursuant to \u00a7 10-13-36.
