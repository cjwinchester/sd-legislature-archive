On any excess tax levy approved after July 1, 2002, the governing body of the taxing district shall specify in the resolution the year or number of years the excess tax levy will be applied. The requirements for an announcement made pursuant to this section are as follows: (1) The decision of the governing body to originally impose or subsequently increase an excess tax levy shall be published within ten days of the decision; (2) Publication shall be made at least twice in the legal newspaper designated by the governing body pursuant to law, with no fewer than five days between publication dates, before the opt out takes effect; (3) The announcement shall be at least three newspaper columns in width and four inches in length or at least one-sixth of a page in size, whichever size is greater; (4) The announcement shall be headed with the following statement in a typeface no less than eighteen point type: \"ATTENTION TAXPAYERS: NOTICE OF PROPERTY TAX INCREASE OF $(fill in amount).\" The remainder of the announcement shall consist of a reproduction of the \"Resolution for Opt Out,\" including the amount that property taxes will be increased annually by the proposed opt out and a statement of the right to refer the decision of the board to a vote of the people as provided in this section. The secretary of revenue and regulation, in rules promulgated pursuant to chapter 1-26, shall prescribe a uniform form to be used by the taxing district for notification of taxpayers as required by this section. However, the requirements of subdivisions (3) and (4) shall be waived if: (A) The opt out is for less than fifteen thousand dollars; or (B) A copy of the resolution for opt out is mailed to every property taxpayer in the local governmental unit, by first class mail or bulk mail, within twenty days of the decision to opt out; and (C) A copy of the resolution for opt out is printed in each official newspaper in the local governmental unit's boundaries.

The referendum election shall be held on or before October first preceding the year the taxes are payable. If the opt out is for the purpose of increasing the secondary road levy pursuant to \u00a7 31-12-27, only the registered voters within the area of the county not included in any municipality, organized civil township, or county road district organized pursuant to chapter 31-12 may petition or vote on the referred decision.
