If the board adopts distinct mortality tables for the different categories of retired members or beneficiaries, the mortality rates must be based on a weighted blend of the tables with the weighting based on the percentage of accrued benefits for each category of members as the actuarial valuation immediately preceding the date of adoption of the mortality tables.

If the actuarial value of assets exceeds the actuarial accrued liability, the minimum actuarial requirement to support benefits includes a thirty year amortizationrecognition of the amount by which the actuarial value of assets exceeds the actuarial accrued liability. However, in no event may the recognition reduce the minimum actuarial requirement to support benefits to a percentage less than the contribution rate. Section 4. That \u00a7 3-12C-704 be AMENDED: 3-12C-704. The COLA payable is the baseline COLA or the restricted COLA, as applicable. The baseline COLA is equal to the increase in the consumer price index, but no less than zero percent and no greater than three and one-half percent. The restricted COLA is equal to the increase in the consumer price index, but no less than zero percent and no greater than the restricted COLA maximum as determined in subdivision (2) of this section. The board shall establish the COLA payable for each fiscal year, based on the fair value funded ratio and actuarially determined contribution rate of the systemthe minimum actuarial requirement to support benefits as of the prior July first and the increase in the consumer price index for the preceding third calendar quarter compared to the consumer price index for the third calendar quarter for the base year (the previous year in which the consumer price index was the highest), by utilizing one of the following subdivisions, as applicable: (1) If the system meets the criteria in subdivisions 3-12C-228(1) and (2) based on the baseline COLA assumption adopted by the board, the COLA payable is the baseline COLA; or (2) If the system does not meet the criteria in subdivisions 3-12C-228(1) and (2) based on the baseline COLA assumption adopted by the board, the system shall calculate a restricted COLA maximum in accordance with the board's funding policy that is equal to the actuarially determined annual COLA rate that results in the criteria in subdivisions 3-12C-228(1) and (2) being satisfied, if achievable. The COLA payable is the restricted COLA. If the criteria in subdivisions 3-12C-228(1) and (2) cannot be satisfied, the COLA payable is zero percent."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [242733], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 23904, "action_date": "2023-01-10T12:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 241498, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/241498.pdf", "status_text": "First Reading House", "journal_page": 14, "committee_id_action": 1159, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 23904, "action_date": "2023-01-11T13:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 241515, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/241515.pdf", "status_text": "Referred to", "journal_page": 24, "committee_id_action": 1159, "committee_id_assigned": 1164, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 23904, "action_date": "2023-02-08T15:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 246979, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/246979.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 1, "committee_id_action": 1164, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 23904, "action_date": "2023-02-08T15:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 247923, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/247923.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 1164, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 76978, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [4467, 4437, 4429, 4334], "Excused": [4401]}}, {"bill_id": 23904, "action_date": "2023-02-08T15:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 247923, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/247923.pdf", "status_text": "Certified uncontested, placed on consent", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 1164, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 23904, "action_date": "2023-02-13T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 249157, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/249157.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass", "journal_page": 283, "committee_id_action": 1159, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 77079, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [4456, 4445, 4441, 4334, 4337, 4459, 4341, 4343, 4344, 4449, 4350, 4351, 4442, 4353, 4354, 4468, 4471, 4358, 4365, 4366, 4368, 4450, 4373, 4374, 4462, 4383, 4452, 4454, 4438, 4384, 4443, 4451, 4388, 4469, 4392, 4447, 4467, 4396, 4397, 4398, 4400, 4401, 4440, 4403, 4437, 4408, 4409, 4458, 4455, 4444, 4412, 4463, 4421, 4464, 4446, 4465, 4470, 4429, 4461], "Nay": [4333, 4375, 4379, 4389, 4393, 4406, 4439, 4417], "Excused": [4385, 4405, 4418]}}, {"bill_id": 23904, "action_date": "2023-02-14T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 249314, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/249314.pdf", "status_text": "First read in Senate and referred to", "journal_page": 261, "committee_id_action": 1183, "committee_id_assigned": 1181, "result": "N", "vote": {}}]}
