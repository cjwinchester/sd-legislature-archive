A person whose name is removed from the voter registration records due to imprisonment is eligible to register or re-register to vote upon release from imprisonment.

At the time of the discharge of any inmate under the provisions of this chapter, the inmate shall receive from the secretary of corrections a certificate stating that the inmate has been restored to the full rights of a citizen. If an inmate is on parole at the time the inmate becomes eligible for discharge, the secretary of corrections shall issue a like certificate stating that the inmate has been restored to the full rights of a citizen. The secretary of corrections shall mail a copy of the certificate to the clerk of court for the county from which the inmate was sentenced. Section 3.
