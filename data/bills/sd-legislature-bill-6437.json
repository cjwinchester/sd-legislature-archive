BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. An elected or appointed municipal, county, or township officer may receive and consider relevant information from any source to perform the duties of office. An elected or appointed municipal, county, or township officer may rely on his or her own experience and background on any official matters, subject to the applicable law and rule concerning recusal and disqualification of a public officer. Section 2. Any public hearing or meeting conducted by an elected or appointed municipal, county, or township officer regarding any proposed ordinance, resolution, or regulation on any subject is legislative in nature and may be conducted informally to the extent the officer deems necessary to secure public comment on matters of public interest. The formal rules of procedure and evidence do not apply to the conduct of the public hearing or meeting. This provision does not abrogate any open meeting requirements in chapter 1-25. Section 3. Any public hearing or meeting conducted by an elected or appointed municipal, county, or township officer regarding a quasi-judicial matter as defined in subdivision 1-32-1(10) may be conducted informally to secure the information required to make a decision. The formal rules of procedure and evidence do not apply to the conduct of the public hearing or meeting. If an officer relies upon any evidence not produced at a public hearing or meeting, the officer shall disclose the evidence publicly and include the information in the public record to afford all parties an opportunity to respond or participate. Failure to make this disclosure may be grounds for the municipal, county, or township officer's disqualification for that particular decision, pursuant to the grounds for disqualification pursuant to section 4 of this Act. Section 4. An elected or appointed municipal, county, or township officer may receive input from the public, directly or indirectly, about any matter of public interest. Such contact alone does not require the officer to recuse himself or herself from serving as a quasi-judicial officer in another capacity. An elected or appointed officer is presumed to be objective and capable of making decisions fairly on the basis of the officer's circumstances and may rely on the officer's own general experience and background. Only by a showing of clear and convincing evidence that the officer's authority, statements, or actions regarding an issue or a party involved demonstrates prejudice or unacceptable risk of bias may an officer be deemed disqualified in a quasi-judicial proceeding."}, {"bill_id": 6437, "bill_version_id": 35695, "bill_version": "Enrolled", "bill_version_date": "2015-02-27T10:19:53.207-06:00",
