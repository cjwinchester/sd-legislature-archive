WHEREAS, bisphenol A (BPA) is a hazardous toxin that can have adverse effects on humans and animals and is found in many plastics, food and drink packaging, baby bottles, teething devices, toys, and other child care articles, and children and babies are exposed to this product on a regular basis; and WHEREAS, there is substantial evidence that BPA has been shown to have hormone disrupting effects. Newborns and infants are a population particularly vulnerable to the effects of BPA; and WHEREAS, a number of states have banned or introduced legislation banning the sale, manufacturing, and distribution of toys, child care articles, baby bottles, and food containers made with BPA, but comprehensive federal legislation is needed to create a national standard for manufacturers, retailers, and other distributors; and WHEREAS, Canada and the European Union recently enacted bans on baby bottles containing BPA, and in Japan the canning industry voluntarily removed BPA from epoxy resin can liners, an action which reduced BPA in blood levels in people by as much as fifty percent; and WHEREAS, the increasing public concern over products containing BPA has led many companies to voluntarily limit the use of this toxic chemical, or in some cases, completely remove BPA from children's products, baby bottles, and reusable water bottles; and WHEREAS, it is in the public interest to urge the United States Congress to enact legislation banning bisphenol A from children's products: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the Senate of the Eighty-sixth Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the House of Representatives concurring therein, that the South Dakota Legislature respectfully urges the United States Congress to enact legislation banning bisphenol A from children's products."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 2944, "action_date": "2011-02-25T13:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 17445, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/17445.pdf", "status_text": "First Reading", "journal_page": 537, "committee_id_action": 113, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 2944, "action_date": "2011-02-28T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 17543, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/17543.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to another day", "journal_page": 550, "committee_id_action": 113, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 2944, "action_date": "2011-03-01T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 17653, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/17653.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to another day", "journal_page": 569, "committee_id_action": 113, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 2944, "action_date": "2011-03-03T13:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 17861, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/17861.pdf", "status_text": "Adopt Resolution", "journal_page": 612, "committee_id_action": 113, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "F", "vote": {"vote_id": 9835, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [44, 75, 30, 79, 40, 46, 41, 2, 77, 13, 55, 43, 16, 81, 52, 80, 8], "Nay": [42, 24, 25, 38, 78, 76, 18, 82, 31, 4, 9, 10, 19, 27, 34, 22], "Excused": [26, 45]}}]}
