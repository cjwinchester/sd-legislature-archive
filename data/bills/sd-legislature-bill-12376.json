BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. The South Dakota Board of Regents may enter into cooperative purchasing agreements with the North Dakota State Board of Higher Education in order to take advantage of economies of scale that could be realized by pooling the needs of several institutions in both states, each of which conducts substantially similar educational, administrative, and research functions. Section 2. For purposes of this Act, the term, cooperative purchasing agreement, means an agreement that permits any party to the agreement to purchase commodities under contracts that have been competitively bid by another party to the agreement. Section 3. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Board of Regents may exercise all powers reasonably necessary to participate as a full and independent partner in a cooperative purchasing agreement, including, without limitation, the power to draw up specifications that will meet the needs of the parties to the agreement, the power to advertise for bids, and the power to accept or reject bids on behalf of the parties to the agreement. If the Board of Regents assumes responsibility under the cooperative agreement to solicit bids for certain commodities, the board shall observe all of the requirements set forth in chapter 5-18, except that the board may purchase at bid price any commodities, materials, supplies, or equipment from contracts that have been competitively bid by any government entity, and except that computer hardware need not be purchased in the manner prescribed in chapter 5-18. In exercising the powers granted by this Act, the Board of Regents is not subject to oversight by the Bureau of Administration or the Bureau of Information and Telecommunications. However, the Board of Regents may not effect a purchase under a cooperative agreement if the commodity specified is available at a lower price under a contract let by the Bureau of Administration."}, {"bill_id": 12376, "bill_version_id": 73598, "bill_version": "Senate Education Engrossed", "bill_version_date": "1997-02-04T00:00:00-06:00", "bill_text": "FOR AN ACT ENTITLED, An Act to authorize the Board of Regents to enter into cooperative purchasing agreements with the North Dakota State Board of Higher Education.

In exercising the powers granted by this Act, the Board of Regents is not subject to oversight by the Bureau of Administration or the Bureau of Information and Telecommunications. If the Bureau of Administration objects that reliance upon such a cooperative agreement with the North Dakota State Board of Higher Education to purchase a particular class of commodities, other than commodities that are unique to higher education or that are available to higher education at an educational discount, would jeopardize the price advantage for the state as a whole, the Board of Regents may only enter into a one year trial agreement with the North Dakota State Board of Higher Education for the purchase of that class of commodities. The Bureau of Administration may, during the trial period, enter into contracts for the benefit of other state agencies. The Board of Regents may not extend its agreement with the North Dakota State Board of Higher Education for the challenged class of commodities unless, at the end of the trial year, the sum of the savings to South Dakota higher education plus any cost increases to other South Dakota state agencies yields an overall reduction in price to the state of South Dakota as a whole. However, the Board of Regents may not effect a purchase under a cooperative agreement if the commodity specified is available at a lower price under a contract let by the Bureau of Administration.
