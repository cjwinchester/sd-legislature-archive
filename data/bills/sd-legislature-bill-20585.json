However, upon the successful completion of a court-approved alcohol treatment program, the court may permit the person to drive for the purpose of employment and may restrict the privilege by the imposition of such conditions as the court sees fit. If the court permits the person to drive, the court shall order the person to install and to use an ignition interlock device approved pursuant to section 3 of this Act in any motor vehicle owned or operated by the person.
