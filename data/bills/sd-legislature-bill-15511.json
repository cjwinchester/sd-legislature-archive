BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That chapter 32-3 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: For the purposes of this Act, the term, flood vehicle, means any passenger motor vehicle which has been submerged or flooded above the bottom of the instrument panel or dashboard. Disclosure that a passenger motor vehicle has become a flood vehicle shall be made at the time of transfer of ownership and the next certificate of title issued after such transfer shall be branded with the word, Flood. Section 2. That chapter 32-3 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: For the purposes of this Act, the term, passenger motor vehicle, means any vehicle driven or drawn by mechanical power manufactured primarily for use on the highways that is nine model years old or less, with a gross vehicle weight rating of less than sixteen thousand pounds. The term does not include a motorcycle, trailer, snowmobile, or manufactured home. Section 3. That chapter 32-3 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: For the purposes of this Act, the term, rebuilt salvage title, means the passenger motor vehicle ownership document issued by the department to the owner of a rebuilt salvage vehicle. Ownership of a passenger motor vehicle may be transferred on a rebuilt salvage title. A vehicle for which a rebuilt salvage title has been issued may be registered for use on the highways. A rebuilt salvage title shall be branded with the words, Rebuilt Salvage. Section 4. That chapter 32-3 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: For the purposes of this Act, the term, rebuilt salvage vehicle, means any passenger motor vehicle which was previously issued a salvage title, was issued an affidavit that the vehicle was rebuilt to nationally recognized standards, and has a decal affixed to the driver's door jam stating, Rebuilt Salvage Vehicle. Any person failing to affix the required decal or any person removing a decal is guilty of a Class 2 misdemeanor. Section 5. That chapter 32-3 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: For the purposes of this Act, the term, salvage title, means a passenger motor vehicle ownership document issued by the department to the owner of a salvage vehicle.

That chapter 32-3 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: For the purposes of this Act, the term, salvage vehicle, means any passenger motor vehicle which has been wrecked, destroyed, or damaged to the extent that the total cost of parts and labor to rebuild or reconstruct the vehicle to its pre-accident condition and for legal operation on the highways exceeds seventy-five percent of the retail value of the vehicle, as set forth in a current edition of any nationally recognized compilation, to include automated data bases, of retail values. The value of repair parts for purposes of this section shall be determined by using the current published retail cost of the repair parts to be used in the repair. If the retail value of labor has not been determined by a purchase in the ordinary course of business, the retail value of the labor is presumed to be the product of the repair time, as provided in a generally accepted auto body repair flat rate manual, multiplied by thirty-five dollars. The term also includes any passenger motor vehicle for which its owner chooses to obtain a salvage title, without regard to the extent of the vehicle's damage and repairs. Such a choice by the owner does not impose on the insurer of the vehicle or an insurer processing a claim made by or on behalf of the owner of the vehicle any obligations or liabilities. Section 7. That chapter 32-3 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: For any passenger motor vehicle, the ownership of which is transferred on or after July 1, 2000, the department shall disclose in writing on the certificate of title if records readily available to the department indicate that the vehicle was salvage, junk, rebuilt salvage, or any other symbol or word of like kind or that it has been damaged by flood. Section 8. That chapter 32-3 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: The department shall indicate on the face of the title or certificate for a passenger motor vehicle, as applicable, if the vehicle is a salvage vehicle, a rebuilt salvage vehicle, or a flood vehicle.

Once a title has been lawfully branded salvage, rebuilt salvage, or flood, it can never be changed. Section 9.

The lessee of the vehicle shall inform the lessor that the leased vehicle has been so damaged within fifteen days after the occurrence of the damage.
