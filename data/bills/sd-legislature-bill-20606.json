In order to maintain eligibility, a student shall: (1) Maintain a cumulative 3.0 grade point average on a 4.0 scale. Cumulative grade point average shall be calculated after the second semester and every semester thereafter. The student shall complete consecutive spring and fall terms in order to remain eligible for continuation of the scholarship program from term to term. A student whose cumulative grade point average falls below 3.0 on a 4.0 scale shall forfeit the scholarship for the subsequent semester and for subsequent semesters until the student has reestablished eligibility. To reestablish eligibility, the student shall comply with all course load, enrollment, and proficiency examination requirements for continued eligibility stated in \u00a7\u00a7 13-55-30 to 13-55-35, inclusive, and the student shall achieve a cumulative grade point average of 3.0, or greater, on a 4.0 scale. The scholarship shall be reinstated beginning the semester following that in which the student achieves a cumulative grade point average of 3.0, or greater, on a 4.0 scale. Reinstatement of a scholarship does not extend the time allowed under the scholarship program; any scholarship award forfeited cannot be reclaimed after a student has regained eligibility. A student whose cumulative grade point average falls below 3.0 on a 4.0 scale a second time forfeits the scholarship for all subsequent semesters; (2) Complete fifteen credit hours of instruction per semester or thirty credit hours of instruction in a twelve month period . The student shall enroll in and complete at least fifteen credit hours of instruction in each consecutive spring and fall term or at least thirty credit hours of instruction in a twelve month period . If the executive director of the Board of Regents determines that a student's failure to enroll or to maintain continued enrollment occurred as a direct result of legitimate factors outside the student's control, or has resulted from the student's participation in an activity that in the executive director's judgment provides knowledge or experience that will enhance the student's academic pursuits, the executive director may extend the student's eligibility to participate in the program for up to two additional years, if the student does not enroll in a noneligible institution; and (3) Sit for and pass all sections of a college proficiency exam as required by Board of Regents Policy Number 2.28 as in effect on January 1, 2003, at the end of the sophomore year. The Board of regents may review and adjust the proficiency examinations administered in keeping with sound academic practice. If such changes are made, the Board of Regents shall notify all eligible institutions of new testing standards or requirements. If the student fails to pass the proficiency examinations the first time, eligibility is forfeited for continuation in the scholarship program."}, {"bill_id": 20606, "bill_version_id": 107254, "bill_version": "House State Affairs Engrossed", "bill_version_date": "2006-01-25T13:43:52-06:00", "bill_text": "FOR AN ACT ENTITLED, An Act to revise certain provisions regarding the continuing eligibility requirements for opportunity scholarship recipients.
