Section 10. That \u00a7 32-6B-58 be amended to read as follows: 32-6B-58.

Reimbursement for parts used in the performance of warranty repair may not be less than the amount paid by the dealer to acquire the parts plus a reasonable allowance for handling, which may not be less than thirty percent current retail rate customarily charged by the vehicle dealer for such parts. Each manufacturer, in establishing a schedule of compensation for warranty work, shall rely on the vehicle dealer's written schedule of hourly labor rates and parts and may not obligate any vehicle dealer to engage in unduly burdensome documentation thereof, including, without limitation, obligating vehicle dealers to engage in transaction by transaction calculations.

The expenses and attorney fees shall be paid to the proposed new owner or transferee at the time of closing of the sale or transfer for which the manufacturer or franchisor exercised its right of first refusal. No payment of expenses and attorney fees is required if the proposed new owner or transferee has not submitted an accounting of those expenses within thirty days of the vehicle dealer's receipt of the manufacturer's or franchisors written request for such an accounting. A manufacturer or franchisor may request an accounting before exercising a right of first refusal; (5) The vehicle dealer has no liability to any person or entity as to any disclosed term, condition, or issue as a result of a manufacturer or franchisor exercising a right of first refusal; and (6) Regardless of any express terms, provisions, or conditions of the franchise, the exercise of the right of first refusal is not unreasonable. Section 15. That \u00a7 32-6B-78 be amended to read as follows: 32-6B-78. The issue in an objection filed under \u00a7\u00a7 32-6B-73 to 32-6B-78, inclusive, either with the department or in a separate civil proceeding, is whether or not the prospective transferee is qualified. The department, or a court in a separate civil proceeding, shall enter an order holding that the prospective transferee either is qualified or is not qualified. If the department's or a court's order is that the prospective transferee is qualified, the dealer's franchise agreement is amended to reflect the change in franchisee and the manufacturer or franchisor shall accept the transfer for all purposes. If the department's or a court's order is that the prospective transferee is not qualified, the department or a court may include specific reasons why the prospective transferee is not qualified and may include specific conditions under which the prospective transferee would be qualified. If the department's or a court's order that a prospective transferee is not qualified includes specific conditions under which the prospective transferee would be qualified, the department or a court may retain jurisdiction of the dispute for a time certain to allow the dealer and prospective transferee to meet the conditions set forth. Section 16.
