The superintendent or the school board shall give written notice of the termination to the teacher; a written statement of the reasons for the termination; access to the employment records of the teacher; the opportunity to the teacher for a hearing before the school board to present reasons in person or in writing why the termination should not occur; and the opportunity to be represented. The hearing provided by this section shall be requested within fifteen days after receipt of the notice. Prior to termination of a teacher for cause pursuant to \u00a7 13-43-6.1, the superintendent, chief executive officer, or a member of the school board shall present to the school board a written recommendation for termination. The recommendation shall state the specific ground or grounds delineated in \u00a7 13-43-6.1 upon which the recommendation is based. Upon receipt of the recommendation for termination, the school board shall notify the teacher of the recommendation for termination and of the teacher's right to a hearing on the recommendation. The notification shall be delivered by certified mail or personal delivery for which a signed release is obtained. The notification shall include a copy of the written recommendation stating the ground or grounds supporting the recommendation and providing notice of the following rights: (1) Right of access to the teacher's employment records; (2) Right to a hearing before the school board to present reasons in person or in writing why the termination should not occur; and (3) Right to be represented at the hearing.

On or before April fifteenth, the school board shall notify the teacher in writing of its intention to not renew any written recommendation for nonrenewal of the teacher's contract. Acceptance by the teacher of an offer from the district to enter into a new contract with the teacher shall be in the manner specified in the offer. Failure of the teacher to accept the offer in the manner specified shall result in the termination of the existing contract between the teacher and the district at the end of its term."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 18976, "action_date": "2004-01-22T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 99669, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/99669.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 161, "committee_id_action": 831, "committee_id_assigned": 820, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 18976, "action_date": "2004-01-29T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 100241, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/100241.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 820, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 18976, "action_date": "2004-01-29T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 100241, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/100241.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to another day", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 820, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 18976, "action_date": "2004-01-30T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 100353, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/100353.pdf", "status_text": "Tabled", "journal_page": 323, "committee_id_action": 820, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 58883, "president_vote": null, "Excused": [3049, 3145], "Yea": [3051, 3067, 3069, 3082, 3104, 3108, 3110, 3131, 3141, 3088, 3083], "Nay": [3053, 3107]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/18976"}
