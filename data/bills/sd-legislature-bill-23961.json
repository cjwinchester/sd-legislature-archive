If the combined total of all ballots cast in the precincts selected does not exceed one hundred ballots, then additional precincts must be randomly selected until the total of all ballots exceeds one hundred ballots. The two statewide contests selected for audit must be the two contests that had the closest statewide margin based upon the number of votes cast. If there is only one statewide contest on the ballot, the county auditor shall select the contest with the closest margin based on the number of votes cast as the second contest to be audited.

That chapter 12-17B be amended with a NEW SECTION: If the results of the post-election audit show a discrepancy in the results greater than the margin by which any contest for elected office on the ballot in the county was decided, the auditor shall notify the candidates for that office. Any candidate who receives a notification from the county auditor shall have an additional seven days from the date from when the auditor sends the notification to file a verified petition requesting a recount of the official returns pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 12-21-10 or 12-21-11.
