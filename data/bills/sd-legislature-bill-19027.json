Section 5. That chapter 58-12 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: If any policy of insurance or plan or program of annuities and benefits mentioned in section 1 of this Act contains a provision against assignment or commutation by any beneficiary thereunder of the money or benefits to be paid or rendered thereunder, or any rights therein, any assignment or commutation or any attempted assignment or commutation by such beneficiary of such money or benefits or rights in violation of such provision is void.
