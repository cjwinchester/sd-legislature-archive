BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That chapter 41-10 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: No shooting preserve operating permit or permit amendment for a new or expanded shooting preserve may be issued if the permit would cause the total number of acres under permit pursuant to this chapter in the affected county to exceed or to continue in excess of the total number of acres of public and private land in the county that were open to public hunting on December first of the previous calendar year. For purposes of this section, the term, public hunting, means that a person may enter onto a parcel of land for hunting purposes without securing the permission of the landowner or lessee. For purposes of this section, public hunting does not include hunting on National Forest Service land. The commission may not revoke, suspend, or fail to renew any valid shooting preserve operating permit on the basis of the permit's effect on the acreages that are subject to the requirements of this section. 750 copies of this document were printed by the South Dakota Legislative Research Council at a cost of $.015 per page. .
