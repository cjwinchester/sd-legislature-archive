If a person holds a winery license and an on-sale license, nothing in this title prevents the licensee from selling distilled liquor and wine obtained from a South Dakota licensed distributor and wine or cider produced and bottled under the winery license; and (6) Ship not more than one case of wine per month for personal use and not for resale, containing not more than nine liters per case to any resident of this state who is at least twenty-one years of age.

Orders for shipments under this subdivision subsequently may be taken by telephone, mail, or any other form of communication. The licensee shall pay the sales tax on any wines shipped for consumption in South Dakota. Section 2. That \u00a7 35-4-11.4 be amended to read as follows: 35-4-11.4.

However, such period may not exceed fifteen consecutive days. If an organization receiving a license pursuant to this section conducts a street dance in conjunction with the special event, the organization shall provide qualified security personnel as deemed necessary by the governing body which issued the license to maintain order during the street dance. Section 3. More than one winery licensee may exercise the privileges of a winery license at a single location.
