All The COLA payable shall be applied annually to all benefits except those depending based on the member's contribution balance shall be annually increased by the COLA accumulated contributions, variable retirement account, or contribution credit. However, the annual increase COLA shall be eliminated for any period of time that a retired member reenters covered employment in the system, unless the member retired as a Class B member other than a justice, judge, or magistrate judge and subsequently has reentered covered employment as a Class A member, or unless the member retired without a benefit suspension pursuant to \u00a7 3-12C-1402 and then reentered active status before July 1, 2004.

In addition, the annual increase COLA applied to the original benefit pursuant to \u00a7 3-12C-703 shall be eliminated for the period of reemployment, unless the member retired as a Class B member other than a justice, judge, or magistrate judge and subsequently reentered covered employment as a Class A member.
