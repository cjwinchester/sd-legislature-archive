If a municipality that owns and operates its own electric utility annexes an area that is or will be served by an electric utility other than the municipal-owned utility, the governing body of the municipality may require minimum electric infrastructure standards for the annexed area. The electric utility has twenty-four months from the time the governing body determines the standards to come into compliance. The minimum electric infrastructure standards may not be more stringent than the infrastructure standards of the municipal-owned electric utility. Infrastructure standards include both design and installation requirements, that must be approved by the municipal-owned electric utility before construction. Infrastructure standards may include aesthetics, capacity, and redundancy."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 11521, "action_date": "2020-01-30T13:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 65199, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/65199.pdf", "status_text": "First Reading House", "journal_page": 98, "committee_id_action": 480, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 11521, "action_date": "2020-02-11T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 67317, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/67317.pdf", "status_text": "Referred to", "journal_page": 256, "committee_id_action": 480, "committee_id_assigned": 461, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 11521, "action_date": "2020-02-24T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 68348, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/68348.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 461, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 11521, "action_date": "2020-02-24T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 68350, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/68350.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 461, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "F", "vote": {"vote_id": 33590, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [1754, 1711, 1736, 1682, 1734, 1731, 1677, 1653, 1723, 1725], "Yea": [1672, 1744], "Excused": [1657]}}, {"bill_id": 11521, "action_date": "2020-02-24T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 68350, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/68350.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to the 41st legislative day", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 461, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 33591, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [1754, 1711, 1672, 1744, 1736, 1682, 1734, 1731, 1677, 1653, 1723, 1725], "Excused": [1657]}}]}
