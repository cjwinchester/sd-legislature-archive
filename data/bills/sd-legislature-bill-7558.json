That the code be amended by adding a NEW SECTION to read: For the purposes of medical care, including organ and tissue transplants, a registered qualifying patient's use of cannabis according to this Act is considered the equivalent of the authorized use of any other medication used at the discretion of a practitioner and does not constitute the use of an illicit substance or otherwise disqualify a qualifying patient from needed medical care.
