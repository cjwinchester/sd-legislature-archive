BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 24-15A-29 be amended to read as follows: 24-15A-29. If a parole is revoked, the board shall establish a discretionary parole date of not more than two years from the date of revocation. Subsequent discretionary hearings shall be held at intervals of not more than two years. The board is not required to see an inmate for a discretionary parole hearing at two-year intervals following a revocation if the inmate receives an additional felony sentence or has a suspended sentence imposed which carries a first parole date longer than two years from the revocation. If a suspended sentence is revoked and the sentence is imposed, a discretionary parole date shall be calculated based on the entire imposed term. If a suspended sentence is revoked and imposed prior to the initial parole date on the incarceration term of the sentence prior to the imposition of the suspended sentence, the parole date calculated on the imposed sentence is an initial parole date with parole release subject to \u00a7 24-15A-38. If a suspended sentence is revoked and imposed after the inmate has been released on parole, or found noncompliant under \u00a7 24-15A-39, the parole date is a discretionary date. Section 2. That \u00a7 24-15A-32 be amended to read as follows: 24-15A-32. Each inmate sentenced to a penitentiary term, except those under a sentence of life or death, or an indeterminate sentence which is not yet set to a term of years by the board or determined to be ineligible for parole as authorized in \u00a7 24-15A-32.1, shall have an initial parole date set by the department. This date shall be calculated by applying the percentage indicated in the following grid to the full term of the inmate's sentence pursuant to \u00a7 22-6-1. The following crimes or an attempt to commit, or a conspiracy to commit, or a solicitation to commit, any of the following crimes shall be considered a violent crime for purposes of setting an initial parole date: murder, manslaughter, rape, aggravated assault, riot, robbery, burglary in the first degree or burglary in the second degree if committed before July 1, 2006, arson, kidnapping, felony sexual contact as defined in \u00a7\u00a7 22-22-7 and 22-22-19.1, child abuse, felony sexual contact as defined in \u00a7 22-22-7.2, felony stalking as defined in \u00a7\u00a7 22-19A-2 and 22-19A-3, photographing a child in an obscene act, felony assault as defined in \u00a7 22-18-26, felony simple assault as defined in \u00a7 22-18-1, commission of a felony while armed as defined in \u00a7\u00a7 22-14-12 and 22-14-13.1, discharging a firearm at an occupied structure or motor vehicle as defined in \u00a7 22-14-20, discharging a firearm from a moving vehicle as defined in \u00a7 22-14-21, criminal pedophilia as defined in \u00a7 22-22-30.1, threatening to commit a sexual offense as defined in \u00a7 22-22-45, abuse or neglect of a disabled adult as defined in \u00a7 22-46-2, and aggravated incest as defined in \u00a7\u00a7 22-22A-3 and 22-22A-3.1: Felony Convictions Felony Class First Second Third Nonviolent Class 6 .25 .30 .40 Class 5 .25 .35 .40 Class 4 .25 .35 .40 Class 3 .30 .40 .50 Class 2 .30 .40 .50 Class 1 .35 .40 .50 Class C .35 .40 .50 Violent Class 6 .35 .45 .55 Class 5 .40 .50 .60 Class 4 .40 .50 .65 Class 3 .50 .60 .70 Class 2 .50 .65 .75 Class 1 .50 .65 .75 Class C .50 .65 .75 Class B 1.0 1.0 1.0 Class A 1.0 1.0 1.0 Each inmate shall serve at least sixty days prior to parole release.
