BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 41-6-18.1 be amended to read as follows: 41-6-18.1. It is a Class 2 misdemeanor for a nonresident to hunt, take or kill waterfowl without a special nonresident waterfowl license and a federal migratory bird stamp or in violation of the conditions of the licenses or the rules of the Game, Fish and Parks Commission. A special nonresident waterfowl license, except as otherwise provided in this title, entitles the licensee to hunt waterfowl for ten consecutive days. Four dollars received from the sale of each nonresident waterfowl license shall be placed in the land acquisition and development fund. The moneys from this fund shall be used to acquire by purchase or lease real property to be used primarily for game production. For each nonresident waterfowl license sold, an amount equal to the cost of a habitat stamp shall be placed into the game, fish and parks fund and shall be used for the purpose of restoring the state pheasant and wildlife populations as provided in \u00a7 41-2-34.1. For each nonresident waterfowl license sold, an amount equal to the cost of the waterfowl restoration stamp shall be included with the moneys collected from the sale of resident waterfowl restoration stamps. This license shall be in such form as the Game, Fish and Parks Commission shall prescribe. The provision in this section limiting the validity of a nonresident waterfowl license to ten consecutive days does not apply in Union, Clay, Bon Homme, Yankton, and Charles Mix counties and in such counties, the nonresident waterfowl license shall be valid during the same period as is a resident waterfowl license. The Game, Fish and Parks Commission may issue no more than four thousand nonresident licenses , by rules promulgated pursuant to chapter 1-26, determine the number of such nonresident licenses to be issued in a calendar year."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 13297, "action_date": "1998-01-21T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 76895, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/76895.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 155, "committee_id_action": 600, "committee_id_assigned": 595, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 13297, "action_date": "1998-01-29T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 76907, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/76907.pdf", "status_text": "Re-referred to", "journal_page": 298, "committee_id_action": 600, "committee_id_assigned": 586, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 13297, "action_date": "1998-02-03T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 76634, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/76634.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 586, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 13297, "action_date": "1998-02-03T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 76634, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/76634.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass,", "journal_page": 361, "committee_id_action": 586, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 40234, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [2101, 2160, 2110, 2190, 2195], "Yea": [2119, 2144, 2173, 2194, 2108, 2157, 2158, 2181]}}, {"bill_id": 13297, "action_date": "1998-02-04T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 76915, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/76915.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to another day", "journal_page": 389, "committee_id_action": 600, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 13297, "action_date": "1998-02-05T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 76917, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/76917.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to another day", "journal_page": 411, "committee_id_action": 600, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 13297, "action_date": "1998-02-09T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 76921, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/76921.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to 36th legislative day", "journal_page": 485, "committee_id_action": 600, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 40589, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [2096, 2097, 2098, 2100, 2101, 2104, 2105, 2107, 2108, 2109, 2110, 2111, 2113, 2114, 2116, 2117, 2120, 2123, 2124, 2126, 2127, 2128, 2132, 2133, 2136, 2139, 2141, 2143, 2144, 2146, 2147, 2150, 2151, 2153, 2154, 2157, 2158, 2159, 2160, 2161, 2162, 2163, 2167, 2168, 2171, 2172, 2173, 2174, 2176, 2177, 2178, 2180, 2181, 2183, 2184, 2185, 2186, 2190, 2192, 2193, 2194, 2195, 2197, 2198, 2134], "Excused": [2106, 2131], "Absent": [2119], "Nay": [2152, 2164]}}]}
