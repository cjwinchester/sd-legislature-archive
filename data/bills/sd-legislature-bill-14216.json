BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 34A-6-67 be amended to read as follows: 34A-6-67. In order to achieve the waste reduction goals provided for under \u00a7 34A-6-60, no No landfill in the state may accept yard waste, lead acid batteries, waste motor oil, or white good appliances for disposal. Office Any county or municipality may require the recycling of office and computer paper, old newspaper, magazines, telephone books, corrugated cardboard, other marketable paper products, containers made from plastic, aluminum and steel, and other municipal solid waste materials that are diverted from landfilling using appropriate methods and technology count toward the waste reduction goal. Appropriate methods and technology includes recycling facilities to divert these materials from landfilling . Section 2. That \u00a7 34A-6-71 be amended to read as follows: 34A-6-71. Regionalization of recycling and solid waste planning, management, operations and disposal are encouraged whenever possible. Any two or more responsible units of government may prepare a single solid waste evaluation as provided in \u00a7 34A-6-70 for the analysis of the solid waste needs within the combined area of the responsible units of government as provided in the joint powers provisions of chapter 1-24. The department shall prepare model joint solid waste planning, management, recycling, operations , and disposal agreements and shall provide them to responsible units for the purpose of promoting regional planning and developing the regional recycling and waste management districts provided for under the statewide comprehensive solid waste management plan. Every regional landfill shall make provisions for municipalities and other political subdivisions responsible for solid waste management to exercise the powers provided for under \u00a7 34A-6-67. However, each regional landfill may establish special rates commensurate with additional costs incurred by the landfill for waste containing materials not excluded from the waste stream as provided for under \u00a7 34A-6-67. Section 3. That \u00a7 34A-6-59 be repealed. 34A-6-59. The Legislature finds that the implementation of federal regulations under subtitle D of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, P.L. 94-580, as amended to January 1, 1992, will reduce the available landfill capacity in the state for the disposal of municipal solid waste. The Legislature further finds: (1) That maximum solid waste source reduction, reuse, recycling and composting are preferable to land disposal, are the most economically sound and environmentally safe methods of solid waste management and are in the best interest of the state in order to protect public health and the environment and to conserve resources, energy and tax dollars; and (2) That education, research, development and innovation in the design, management and operation of source reduction, reuse, recycling and composting are essential in reducing operating costs and providing incentives for the use of these systems and operations and their products. Section 4. That \u00a7 34A-6-60 be repealed. 34A-6-60. The Legislature intends by \u00a7 \u00a7 34A-6-59 to 34A-6-92, inclusive, to establish programs and regulations that reduce the waste stream disposed of in landfills in this state and thus protect the public health, safety, and welfare of all South Dakotans, protect the environment, and return resources back to industry for reuse. The goal of the state is to reduce the amount of materials in the waste stream being landfilled. The amount of materials being landfilled shall be reduced using appropriate methods and technology through the practice of solid waste reduction, waste diversion, reuse, recycling, composting, and waste- to-energy. The goal of the state is to reduce the waste stream disposed in landfills by fifty percent by July 1, 2001. For the purposes of this section, the term, waste stream, means the disposal of solid waste as defined in \u00a7 34A-6-1.3. The base year for establishing the amount of materials in the waste stream is the calendar year 1990. Total tonnage of solid waste landfilled in the calendar year 1990 is the basis for all waste reduction calculations. In the absence of scale data and cubic yardage data of waste materials landfilled, the base tonnage is calculated as eight-tenths of a ton per year per person, in residence, serviced by the landfill. Tonnage may be estimated by equating one cubic yard of solid waste received at the landfill gate to seven hundred pounds of solid waste. In determining the reduction level of the waste stream, it is assumed that each person in 1990 generated eight- tenths of a ton per year of municipal solid waste. Any landfill that conducted waste reduction or recycling programs before the 1990 base calendar year and increased its ability to reduce waste stream volume may receive credit for prior recycled tonnage in the solid waste source reduction and recycling plan required by \u00a7 34A- 6-74. Similarly, any landfill that has experienced or will experience a growth in its population served may submit justification for increased tonnage, even after waste reduction or recycling programs have been implemented. Section 5. That \u00a7 34A-6-62 be repealed. 34A-6-62. The department shall establish a statewide waste reduction and recycling program to promote the waste management policy contained in \u00a7 34A-6-59 and 34A-6-60 and the waste management hierarchy contained in \u00a7 34A-6-1.2. The program shall encourage waste generators to reduce the volume of waste generated and to recycle the waste that is generated. The program shall utilize financial and legal incentives, education, technical assistance, regulation and other implementation methods. The program shall involve the development of public and private sector initiatives, the development of markets and other opportunities for waste reduction and recycling, and other related efforts. Section 6. That \u00a7 34A-6-63 be repealed. 34A-6-63. The elements of the program required in \u00a7 34A-6-62 shall include promotion of: (1) Efforts to increase the purchase and use of recycled products by government, business and the public; (2) Efforts to recover recyclable materials from the waste stream; (3) Local efforts to implement recycling collection centers; (4) Local efforts for curbside collection of separated recyclable waste materials and local efforts for drop-off sites or programs for rural areas; (5) Public education programs that promote public awareness of waste volume reduction and the use of recyclable materials; (6) Markets for recyclable materials; (7) Research, manufacturing processes and product development that provide for source reduction through use of alternative materials and through decreased material input and resource consumption; and (8) Information-sharing and coordination of efforts among state governments in such areas as recycling education, technical assistance, market analysis and related topics. Section 7. That \u00a7 34A-6-70 be repealed. 34A-6-70. Each county and first class municipality shall prepare or have prepared, on or before January 1, 1993, a solid waste evaluation coordinated with the state solid waste management plan provided for in \u00a7 34A-6-1.5. The evaluation shall cover a fifteen-year time period, shall serve as the basis for county and municipal decisions on the need for facilities, and shall be provided to the board for its consideration in determining whether to issue facility permits under \u00a7 34A-6-1.13. The evaluation shall include an analysis of the current and projected volume of solid waste, disposal capacity including all existing and planned facilities, the potential for source reduction, reuse, recycling, resource recovery and shared and regional recycling and waste management facilities. The evaluation shall include a full accounting of the true and total cost, including the long-term costs, of all options analyzed in the evaluation. Counties and municipalities subject to this section shall consider in their solid waste evaluation, 40 CFR parts 257 and 258 of the environmental protection agency solid waste disposal criteria commonly known as \"RCRA subtitle D regulations,\" as finally adopted and published in the federal register on October 9, 1991, and as amended to January 1, 1992, the statewide comprehensive solid waste management plan and all rules adopted by the board. Section 8. That \u00a7 34A-6-73 be repealed. 34A-6-73. Each county and first class municipality shall be the responsible unit of government for preparing the solid waste evaluation required under \u00a7 34A-6-70. The responsible unit shall evaluate capacity to meet the solid waste management needs of the unit for a period of at least fifteen years. Capacity shall be sufficient to meet the requirements of state law and all applicable requirements of the United States Environmental Protection Agency. The evaluation shall be submitted to the department on or before January 1, 1993, and shall provide details of a local recycling program which shall contain a methodology for meeting the state source reduction and recycling goal pursuant to \u00a7 34A-6-20 and a methodology for implementing a program of separation of wastes including yard waste, glass, plastic, paper and metal. Section 9. That \u00a7 34A-6-74 be repealed. 34A-6-74. Every municipality or other political subdivision responsible for solid waste management shall file with the department by January 1, 1994, a comprehensive solid waste source reduction and recycling plan detailing the method by which the municipality or other political subdivision responsible for solid waste management will comply with the requirements of \u00a7 34A-6-67 to establish and implement a comprehensive solid waste source reduction and recycling program for its residents. For the purposes of this section, any public or private entity managing the solid waste stream for a municipality or county shall file one comprehensive plan on behalf of its members with the filing requirements of this section. The department shall review each comprehensive plan submitted and may reject, suggest modifications to or approve the proposed plan. The department shall aid in the development of comprehensive plans for compliance with this section and shall make available appropriate forms for the submission of comprehensive plans. The department may hold hearings for the purpose of implementing this section. The comprehensive plan required in this section shall be updated and submitted to the department for approval five years after its most recent approval. The department may, consistent with rules promulgated by the board pursuant to chapter 1-26, require the filing or updating of a plan at other times. Section 10. That \u00a7 34A-6-75 be repealed. 34A-6-75. Beginning July 1, 1994, no new permit for a solid waste disposal facility may be issued and no existing permit reissued or renewed unless the permit applicant, in conjunction with all local units of government whose residents, businesses or institutions generate solid waste to be stored or disposed of in the facility, has filed a plan as required in \u00a7 34A-6-74. Section 11. That \u00a7 34A-6-76 be repealed. 34A-6-76. Beginning July 1, 1997, no new permit for a solid waste disposal facility may be issued and no existing permit may be reissued or renewed unless the permit applicant, in conjunction with all local units of government whose residents, businesses or institutions generate solid waste to be stored or disposed of in the facility, documents that steps are being taken to begin implementing the plan filed pursuant to \u00a7 34A-6-74. Section 12. That \u00a7 34A-6-77 be repealed. 34A-6-77. Beginning July 1, 2000, no existing solid waste disposal permit may be reissued or renewed unless the permit applicant, in conjunction with all local units of government whose residents, businesses or institutions generate solid waste to be stored or disposed of in the facility, documents that alternative methods of solid waste management other than use of a sanitary landfill have been implemented as set forth in the plan filed pursuant to \u00a7 34A-6-74. Section 13. That \u00a7 34A-6-78 be repealed. 34A-6-78. Beginning July 1, 2000, no new solid waste disposal facility permit for a landfill may be issued unless the applicant, in conjunction with all local units of government whose residents, businesses or institutions generate solid waste to be stored or disposed of in the facility, certifies that the landfill is needed as a part of an alternative solid waste management method."}, {"bill_id": 14216, "bill_version_id": 80888, "bill_version": "House Engrossed", "bill_version_date": "1999-02-04T00:00:00-06:00", "bill_text": "FOR AN ACT ENTITLED, An Act to repeal certain recycling requirements.
