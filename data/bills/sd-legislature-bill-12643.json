That chapter 13-13 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: A school district may elect to have its average daily membership for purposes of distribution of state aid to education based on the average of the average daily membership for the previous three school years. If a district elects to use the three year average provided in this section, it shall notify the Department of Education and Cultural Affairs no later than September thirtieth of the school fiscal year for which state aid is to be distributed. If a school district elects to use a three year average provided for in this section, a three year average must be used for at least five years. The three year average in subsequent years is the average for the three school fiscal years prior to the school fiscal year in which state aid to education is distributed. After a school district that has elected to use the three year average provided for in this section has met the five year requirement for using the three year average, it shall notify the Department of Education and Cultural Affairs no later than September thirtieth of each year whether the district elects to continue to use the three year average.
