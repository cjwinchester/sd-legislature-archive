The special fee shall be calculated at a rate of two dollars and fifty cents per mile of pipeline multiplied by a fee of ten cents per barrel on the reported daily maximum capacity for one day, by each pipeline. If the miles of pipeline or reported daily maximum capacity changes during a calendar year for a pipeline, the special fee shall be calculated based on the highest number of total miles of pipeline and highest daily maximum capacity at any point during that calendar year. The fee by any pipeline contributed to the SPOIL Fund may not exceed one hundred million dollars annually. If the SPOIL fund is not accessed in any given year, the special fee will be waived until the fund is accessed. The total extraordinary expenses shall include the interest computed at the federal short-term applicable rate as set forth under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6621(b)(3), and in effect on January 1, 2020.
