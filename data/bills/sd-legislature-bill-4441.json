BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA, THE SENATE CONCURRING THEREIN: WHEREAS, this nation has become deeply in debt as its expenditures have exceeded available revenues so that the total federal public debt now exceeds sixteen trillion dollars and continues to increase, and is of such great proportion that responsibility for its payment, with interest, will be passed to future, unborn generations of Americans to assume without their consent; and WHEREAS, attempts to curtail federal spending, confine expenditures to available revenues, and reduce the annual deficit have not been successful; and WHEREAS, in recent years Congress has mandated the implementation of government programs by the states without providing funding for all such programs, and could continue to encroach on state budgets as a means of balancing the federal budget; and WHEREAS, the Constitution of the State of South Dakota provides for a balanced budget, and this provision has reinforced the inherent fiscal common sense of spending only funds available and has contributed to the state's outstanding reputation for sound fiscal management and policy; and WHEREAS, efforts in Congress to amend the Constitution of the United States to add a balanced budget requirement have not been successful; and WHEREAS, Article V of the Constitution of the United States grants to the states the right to initiate a process of amending the constitution through application by the Legislatures of two-thirds of the several states to the Congress, calling for an amendment convention; and WHEREAS, in Federalist No. 85, Alexander Hamilton wrote in reference to Article V of the Constitution and the calling of a convention for the purpose of proposing amendments that \"We may safely rely on the disposition of the state legislatures to erect barriers against the encroachments of the national authority\"; and WHEREAS, the Congress is required by Article V to call such a convention upon receipt of such applications from two-thirds of the states: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the House of Representatives of the Eighty-Eighth Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the Senate concurring therein, that the State of South Dakota does hereby apply to the Congress of the United States to call an amendment convention pursuant to Article V of the United States Constitution for the purpose of proposing an amendment to the United States Constitution to require a balanced federal budget, except in the event of war, economic calamity, or national catastrophe, and any terms or conditions necessary for implementation of the amendment; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the other states be encouraged to make similar applications for an amendment convention pursuant to Article V of the Constitution of the United States; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that this application constitutes a continuing application for such amendment convention pursuant to Article V of the Constitution of the United States until the Legislatures of two-thirds of the states have made such applications and such convention has been called by the Congress of the United States; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the secretary of state transmit copies of this resolution to the President of the United States, the Speaker and the Clerk of the United States House of Representatives, the President and the Clerk of the United States Senate, the members of the South Dakota congressional delegation, and the Legislatures of each of the several states, attesting the adoption of this resolution by the Legislature of the State of South Dakota."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 4441, "action_date": "2013-01-29T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 24922, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/24922.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 230, "committee_id_action": 202, "committee_id_assigned": 196, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 4441, "action_date": "2013-02-12T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 25434, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/25434.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 196, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 4441, "action_date": "2013-02-19T08:30:00-06:00", "document_id": 25773, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/25773.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 196, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 4441, "action_date": "2013-02-19T08:30:00-06:00", "document_id": 25912, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/25912.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to the 41st legislative day", "journal_page": 431, "committee_id_action": 196, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 13947, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [344, 324, 390, 343, 316, 377, 404, 398, 410, 375, 355], "Nay": [347, 392, 373, 318]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/4441"}
