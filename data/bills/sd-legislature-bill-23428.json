The amount of the annual award shall be as follows: (1) One thousand dollars for the first year of attendance; (2) One thousand dollars for the second year of attendance; (3) One thousand dollars for the third year of attendance; (4) Two thousand dollars for the fourth year of attendance unless the student attended full-time a regionally accredited university, college, or technical school located outside South Dakota prior to admission to the program, in which case the award shall be one thousand dollars.
