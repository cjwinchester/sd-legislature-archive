Any person adjudicated, convicted, the subject of an informal adjustment or court-approved diversion program, or the subject of a suspended imposition of sentence or suspended adjudication of delinquency for possession, use, or distribution of controlled drugs or substances or marijuana as defined in chapter 22-42, or for ingesting, inhaling, or otherwise taking into the body any substances as prohibited by \u00a7 22-42-15, is ineligible to participate in any extracurricular activity at any secondary school accredited by the Department of Education for one calendar year from the date of adjudication, conviction, diversion, or suspended imposition of sentence. The one-year suspension may be reduced to sixty school thirty calendar days if the person participates in an assessment with a certified chemical dependency counselor or completes an accredited intensive prevention or treatment program. If the assessment indicates the need for a higher level of care, the student is required to complete the prescribed program before becoming eligible to participate in extracurricular activities. Upon a second adjudication, conviction, diversion, or suspended imposition of a sentence for possession, use, or distribution of controlled drugs, substances, or marijuana as defined in chapter 22-42, or for ingesting, inhaling, or otherwise taking into the body any substance as prohibited by \u00a7 22-42-15, by a court of competent jurisdiction, that person is ineligible to participate in any extracurricular activity at any secondary school accredited by the Department of Education for one year from the date of adjudication, conviction, diversion, or suspended imposition of sentence. The one year suspension may be reduced to sixty calendar days if the person completes an accredited intensive prevention or treatment program. Upon a third or subsequent adjudication, conviction, diversion, or suspended imposition of sentence for possession, use, or distribution of controlled drugs or substances or marijuana as defined in chapter 22-42, or for ingesting, inhaling, or otherwise taking into the body any substances as prohibited by \u00a7 22-42-15, by a court of competent jurisdiction, that person is ineligible to participate in any extracurricular activity at any secondary school accredited by the Department of Education.

The Unified Judicial System shall give notice to the chief administrators of secondary schools accredited by the Department of Education for any such determination in a court proceeding for any person eighteen to twenty-one years of age without regard to current status in school or involvement in extracurricular activities. The notice shall include name, date of birth, city of residence, and offense. The chief administrator shall give notice to the South Dakota High School Activities Association if any such person is participating in extracurricular activities. Upon placement of the person in an informal adjustment or court-approved diversion program, the state's attorney who placed the person in that program shall give notice of that placement to the South Dakota High School Activities Association and chief administrator of the school in which the person is participating in any extracurricular activity. As used in this section, the term, extracurricular activity, means any activity sanctioned by the South Dakota High School Activities Association.

The time period of suspension shall begin on the day of the first allowable South Dakota High School Activities Association sanctioned event through midnight of the last day of the South Dakota High School Activities Association sanctioned event of the school year in which the suspension occurred. A suspension that is not completed by the student during one activity year shall carry over to the next activity year. A suspension begins at 12:00 a.m. on the day following the notification of a school administrator that a student has been adjudicated, convicted, the subject of an informal adjustment or court approved diversion program, or the subject of a suspended imposition of a sentence or a suspended adjudication of delinquency for possession, use, or distribution of controlled drugs, substances, or marijuana as defined in chapter 22-42, or for ingesting, inhaling, or otherwise taking into the body any substance prohibited by \u00a7 22-42-15, or at 12:00 a.m. on the first day of the activity year, whichever occurs first."}, {"bill_id": 5745, "bill_version_id": 29767, "bill_version": "Senate Education Engrossed", "bill_version_date": "2014-02-04T13:18:58.653-06:00", "bill_text": "FOR AN ACT ENTITLED, An Act to revise the minimum suspension requirements for students participating in extracurricular activities.
