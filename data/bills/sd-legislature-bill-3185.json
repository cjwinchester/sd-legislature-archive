BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 51A-6A-19.2 be amended to read as follows: 51A-6A-19.2. Any trust company authorized by this title, shall, before transacting any such business, pledge to the division and maintain at all times investments for the security of the trust creditors of the trust company including as a priority claim costs incurred by the division in a receivership or liquidation of the trust company in the event it should fail. The amount of the pledge shall be determined by the director in an amount deemed appropriate to defray such costs, but may not be less than a market value of one hundred thousand dollars, and may not exceed five hundred thousand dollars for a private trust company or one million dollars for a public trust company. All investments pledged to the division shall be held at a depository institution in this state and all costs associated with pledging and holding such investments are the responsibility of the trust company. The amount of the pledge may not exceed fifty percent of the trust company's capital. The investments pledged to the division shall be of the same nature and quality as those required for public funds as provided in\u00a7\u00a7 4-5-6 and 4-5-6.1. The commission may promulgate rules pursuant to chapter 1-26 to establish additional investment guidelines or investment options for purposes of the pledge required by this section. In the event of a receivership of a trust company, the director may, without regard to priorities, preferences, or adverse claims, reduce the pledged investments to cash and, as soon as practicable, utilize the cash to defray the costs associated with the receivership. Income from such investments shall belong to and be paid to the trust company as long as it continues to conduct its business in the ordinary course and so long as authorized by the director. The proposed effective date of an order requiring an existing trust company to increase its pledge must shall be stated in the order as on or after the thirty-first day after the date of the proposed order. Unless the trust company requests a hearing before the commission in writing before the effective date of the proposed order, the order becomes effective and is final. Any hearing before the commission shall be held pursuant to chapter 1-26. Section 2. That \u00a7 51A-6A-11.1 be amended to read as follows: 51A-6A-11.1. A public trust company chartered in South Dakota, after June 30, 2010, shall establish office premises in South Dakota that would establish jurisdiction over a trust for which the trust company would be a qualified person under \u00a7 55-3-39 shall: (1) Maintain office space in South Dakota for trust company business and for the storage of, and access to, trust company records required by \u00a7 51A-6A-30; (2) Hold no less than two governing board meetings with a quorum physically present in South Dakota annually; (3) Employ, engage, or contract with at least one trust officer or key employee to provide services for the trust company in South Dakota related to the powers of the company in \u00a7 51A-6A-29 and to facilitate the examinations required by \u00a7 51A-6A-31; and (4) Perform trust administration in South Dakota. Public Each public trust companies company chartered in South Dakota prior to July 1, 2010 2012, shall meet the requirements of this section no later than July 1, 2015, unless the director grants an extension of up to twenty-four months upon a showing of good faith effort. A public trust company seeking an extension of time shall include in its application to the director the reasons for any delay and a detailed time line for expected compliance with this section. The commission may promulgate rules pursuant to chapter 1-26 to establish additional guidelines regarding what constitutes trust administration in South Dakota for purposes of this section. Section 3. That \u00a7 51A-6A-39 be amended to read as follows: 51A-6A-39. All information the director generates in making an investigation or examination of a state trust company is confidential. All confidential information is the property of the state and is not subject to disclosure except upon the written approval of the director shall remain the property of the division and shall be furnished to the trust company for its confidential use. Under no circumstances may a trust company disclose a report or any supporting documentation to anyone, other than directors and officers of the trust company or anyone acting in a fiduciary capacity for the trust company, without written permission from the director. The director shall give ten days' prior written notice of intent to disclose confidential information to the affected trust company. Any trust company which receives a notice may object to the disclosure of the confidential information and shall be afforded the right to a hearing in accordance with the provisions of chapter 1-26. If a trust company requests a hearing, the director may not reveal confidential information prior to the conclusion of the hearing and a ruling. Disclosure of confidential information shall be made only to formal regulatory bodies which clearly have a need for the confidential information. Prior to dissemination of any confidential information, the director shall require a written agreement not to reveal the confidential information by the party receiving the confidential information. In no event may the director disclose confidential information to the general public, any competitor, or any potential competitor of a trust company. The submission of any information to the division in the course of any investigation or examination may not be construed as waiving, destroying, or otherwise affecting any privilege any person may claim with respect to the information under South Dakota law or federal law. Section 4. That \u00a7 55-2-15 be amended to read as follows: 55-2-15. Unless the terms of the governing instrument expressly provide otherwise, if a trustee has discretion under the terms of a governing instrument to make a distribution of income or principal to or for the benefit of one or more beneficiaries of a trust (the \"first trust\"), whether or not restricted by any standard, then the trustee may instead exercise such discretion by appointing part or all of the income or principal subject to the discretion in favor of a trustee of a second trust (the \"second trust\") under a governing instrument separate from the governing instrument of the first trust. Before exercising its discretion to appoint and distribute assets to a second trust, the trustee of the first trust shall determine whether the appointment is necessary or desirable after taking into account the purposes of the first trust, the terms and conditions of the second trust, and the consequences of the distribution. For the purposes of this section, a trustee of the first trust is a restricted trustee if either the trustee is a beneficiary of the first trust or if a beneficiary of the first trust has a power to change the trustees within the meaning of \u00a7 55-2-17. In addition, the following apply to all appointments made under this section: (1) The second trust may only have as beneficiaries one or more of the beneficiaries of the first trust: (a) To or for whom a discretionary distribution of income or principal may be made from the first trust; or (b) To or for whom a distribution of income or principal may be made in the future from the first trust at a time or upon the happening of an event specified under the first trust; (2) No restricted trustee of the first trust may exercise such authority over the first trust to the extent that doing so could have the effect of: (a) Benefiting the restricted trustee as a beneficiary of the first trust, unless the exercise of such authority is limited by an ascertainable standard based on or related to health, education, maintenance, or support; or (b) Removing restrictions on discretionary distributions to a beneficiary imposed by the governing instrument under which the first trust was created, except that a provision in the second trust which limits distributions by an ascertainable standard based on or related to the health, education, maintenance, or support of any such beneficiary is permitted; (3) No restricted trustee of the first trust may exercise such authority over the first trust to the extent that doing so would have the effect of increasing the distributions that can be made from the second trust to the restricted trustees of the first trust or to a beneficiary who may change the trustees of the first trust within the meaning of \u00a7 55-2-17 compared to the distributions that can be made to such trustee or beneficiary, as the case may be, under the first trust, unless the exercise of such authority is limited by an ascertainable standard based on or related to health, education, maintenance, or support; (4) The provisions of subdivisions (2) and (3) only apply to restrict the authority of a trustee if either a trustee, or a beneficiary who may change the trustee, is a United States citizen or domiciliary under the Internal Revenue Code, or the trust owns property that would be subject to United States estate or gift taxes if owned directly by such a person; (5) In the case of any trust contributions which have been treated as gifts qualifying for the exclusion from gift tax described in \u00a7 2503(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, by reason of the application of I.R.C. \u00a7 2503(c), the governing instrument for the second trust shall provide that the beneficiary's remainder interest shall vest no later than the date upon which such interest would have vested under the terms of the governing instrument for the first trust; (6) The exercise of such authority may not reduce any income interest of any income beneficiary of any of the following trusts: (a) A trust for which a marital deduction has been taken for federal tax purposes under I.R.C. \u00a7 2056 or \u00a7 2523 or for state tax purposes under any comparable provision of applicable state law; (b) A charitable remainder trust under I.R.C. \u00a7 664; or (c) A grantor retained annuity trust under I.R.C. \u00a7 2702; (7) The exercise of such authority does not apply to trust property subject to a presently exercisable power of withdrawal held by a trust beneficiary to whom, or for the benefit of whom, the trustee has authority to make distributions, unless after the exercise of such authority, such beneficiary's power of withdrawal is unchanged with respect to the trust property; (8) The exercise of such authority is not prohibited by a spendthrift clause or by a provision in the governing instrument that prohibits amendment or revocation of the trust; (9) Any appointment made by a trustee shall be considered a distribution by the trustee pursuant to the trustee's distribution powers and authority; and (10) If the trustee's distribution discretion is not subject to a standard, or if the trustee's distribution discretion is subject to a standard that does not create a support interest, then the court may review the trustee's determination or any related appointment only pursuant to \u00a7 55-1-43. Any other court review of the trustee's determination or any related appointment may be made only pursuant to \u00a7 55-1-42. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section, the governing instrument of the second trust may grant a power of appointment to one or more of the beneficiaries of the second trust who are beneficiaries of the first trust. The power of appointment may include the power to appoint trust property to the holder of the power of appointment, the holder's creditors, the holder's estate, the creditors of the holder's estate, or any other person, whether or not that person is a trust beneficiary. This section applies to any trust governed by the laws of this state, including a trust whose governing jurisdiction is transferred to this state. Section 5. That \u00a7 55-1B-2 be amended to read as follows: 55-1B-2. An excluded fiduciary is not liable, either individually or as a fiduciary, for any of the following: (1) Any loss that results from compliance with a direction of the trust advisor, custodial account owner, or authorized designee of a custodial account owner, including any loss from the trust advisor breaching fiduciary responsibilities or acting beyond the trust advisor's scope of authority; (2) Any loss that results from a failure to take any action proposed by an excluded fiduciary that requires a prior authorization of the trust advisor if that excluded fiduciary timely sought but failed to obtain that authorization; (3) Any loss that results from any action or inaction, except for gross negligence or willful misconduct, when an excluded fiduciary is required, pursuant to the trust agreement or any other reason, to assume the role of trust advisor, trust protector, investment trust advisor, or distribution trust advisor. Any excluded fiduciary is also relieved from any obligation to review or evaluate any direction from a distribution trust advisor or to perform investment or suitability reviews, inquiries, or investigations or to make recommendations or evaluations with respect to any investments to the extent the trust advisor, custodial account owner, or authorized designee of a custodial account owner had authority to direct the acquisition, disposition, or retention of any such investment. If the excluded fiduciary offers such communication to the trust advisor, trust protector, investment trust advisor, or distribution trust advisor or any investment person selected by the investment trust advisor, such action may not be deemed to constitute an undertaking by the excluded fiduciary to monitor or otherwise participate in actions within the scope of the advisor's authority or to constitute any duty to do so. Any excluded fiduciary is also relieved of any duty to communicate with or warn or apprise any beneficiary or third party concerning instances in which the excluded fiduciary would or might have exercised the excluded fiduciary's own discretion in a manner different from the manner directed by the trust advisor, trust protector, investment trust advisor, or distribution trust advisor. Absent clear and convincing evidence to the contrary provisions in the governing instrument, the actions of the excluded fiduciary (such as any communications with the trust advisor and others and carrying out, recording, and reporting actions taken at the trust advisor's direction) pertaining to matters within the scope of authority of the trust advisor, trust protector, investment trust advisor, or distribution trust advisor (such as confirming that the advisor's directions have been carried out and recording and reporting actions taken at the advisor's direction) shall be presumed deemed to be administrative actions taken by the excluded fiduciary solely to allow the excluded fiduciary to perform those duties assigned to the excluded fiduciary under the governing instrument, and such administrative actions may not be deemed to constitute an undertaking by the excluded fiduciary to monitor or otherwise, participate in, or otherwise take any fiduciary responsibility for actions within the scope of authority of the trust advisor, trust protector, investment trust advisor, or distribution trust advisor. Nothing in subdivision (2) imposes an obligation or liability with respect to a custodian of a custodial account. Section 6. That \u00a7 55-1B-10 be amended to read as follows: 55-1B-10. The powers and discretions of an investment trust advisor shall be provided in the trust instrument and may be exercised or not exercised, in the best interests of the trust, in the sole and absolute discretion of the investment trust advisor and are binding on any other person and any other interested party, fiduciary, and excluded fiduciary. Unless the terms of the document governing instrument provide otherwise, the investment trust advisor has the power to perform the following: (1) Direct the trustee with respect to the retention, purchase, sale, or encumbrance of trust property and the investment and reinvestment of principal and income of the trust; (2) Vote proxies for securities held in trust; and (3) Select one or more investment advisers, managers, or counselors, including the trustee, and delegate to them any of its powers; and (4) Direct the trustee with respect to any additional powers and discretions over investment and management of trust assets provided in the governing instrument. Section 7. That \u00a7 55-1B-11 be amended to read as follows: 55-1B-11. The powers and discretions of a distribution trust advisor over any discretionary distributions of income or principal, including distributions pursuant to an ascertainable standard or other criteria and appointments pursuant to \u00a7 55-2-15, shall be provided in the trust instrument and may be exercised or not exercised, in the best interests of the trust, in the sole and absolute discretion of the distribution trust advisor and are binding on any other person and any other interested party, fiduciary, and excluded fiduciary. Unless the terms of the document provide otherwise, the distribution trust advisor shall direct the trustee with regard to all discretionary distributions to beneficiaries and may direct appointments pursuant to \u00a7 55-2-15. The distribution trust advisor may also provide direction regarding notification of qualified beneficiaries pursuant to \u00a7 55-2-13. Section 8. That chapter 55-1 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: For purposes of sections 8 to 13, inclusive, of this Act, a no contest clause is a provision or clause in a trust, that penalizes a qualified beneficiary for contesting a trust or instituting other proceedings at law or equity relating to the trust estate, excluding proceedings related to trust administration. Except as provided in sections 9 to 13, inclusive, of this Act, a no contest clause shall be enforced unless probable cause exists for instituting the proceeding on the grounds of: (1) Fraud; (2) Duress; (3) Revocation; (4) Lack of contractual capacity; (5) Undue influence; (6) Mistake; (7) Forgery; or (8) Irregularity in the execution of the trust document.

Section 11. That chapter 55-1 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in sections 8 to 13, inclusive, of this Act, a no contest clause is enforceable against a beneficiary to the extent the beneficiary elects to contest or otherwise challenge the settlor's signature whereby such a challenge does not in any manner constitute good, probable, or reasonable cause if the settlor's signature was witnessed by nonrelative witnesses or a duly qualified nonrelative notary public or both. Section 12. That chapter 55-1 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: The court may award attorneys fees and costs to the prevailing party in an action involving the enforceability of a no contest provision. Section 13. Sections 8 to 12, inclusive, of this Act, are effective for all trusts in existence on or created after July 1, 2012. Section 14.

Any such beneficiary may release the trustee from liability to such beneficiary for past violations of any of the provisions of this chapter. No consideration is required for the consent, release, or ratification to be valid. Section 15. That \u00a7 55-16-5 be amended to read as follows: 55-16-5. Any individual may serve as an investment trust advisor described in subdivision 55-1B-1(6), notwithstanding that such individual is the transferor of the qualified disposition, but such an individual may not otherwise serve as a fiduciary of a trust that is a qualified disposition except with respect to the retention of the veto right permitted by subdivision 55-16-2(2). While serving as an advisor of the trust, the individual may have all powers authorized by statute or by the trust instrument, including the power to vote by proxy any stock owned by the trust. Section 16. That \u00a7 55-16-10 be amended to read as follows: 55-16-10. A cause of action or claim for relief with respect to a fraudulent transfer of a settlor's assets under \u00a7 55-16-9 is extinguished unless the action under \u00a7 55-16-9 is brought by a creditor of the settlor who meets one of the following requirements: (1) Is a creditor of the settlor before the settlor's assets are transferred to the trust, and the action under \u00a7 55-16-9 is brought within the later of: (a) Three Two years after the transfer is made; or (b) One year Six months after the transfer is or reasonably could have been discovered by the creditor if the creditor: (i) Can demonstrate that the creditor asserted a specific claim against the settlor before the transfer; or (ii) Files another action, other than an action under \u00a7 55-16-9, against the settlor that asserts a claim based on an act or omission of the settlor that occurred before the transfer, and the action described in this sub-subsection is filed within three two years after the transfer; or (2) Becomes a creditor subsequent to the transfer into trust, and the action under \u00a7 55-16-9 is brought within three two years after the transfer is made.

That \u00a7 55-16-11 be amended to read as follows: 55-16-11.

This applies regardless of whether the distributions are made to or for the benefit of the transferor or a beneficiary during the period in which a creditor or other person could make a claim as provided in \u00a7 55-16-10.

Unless the terms of the governing instrument expressly provide otherwise, if a trustee has discretion under the terms of a governing instrument to make a distribution of income or principal to or for the benefit of one or more beneficiaries of a trust (the \"first trust\"), whether or not restricted by any standard, then the trustee may instead exercise such discretion by appointing part or all of the income or principal subject to the discretion in favor of a trustee of a second trust (the \"second trust\") under a governing instrument separate from the governing instrument of the first trust. Before exercising its discretion to appoint and distribute assets to a second trust, the trustee of the first trust shall determine whether the appointment is necessary or desirable after taking into account the purposes of the first trust, the terms and conditions of the second trust, and the consequences of the distribution.

Any other court review of the trustee's determination or any related appointment may be made only pursuant to \u00a7 55-1-42. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section, the governing instrument of the second trust may grant a power of appointment to one or more of the beneficiaries of the second trust who are beneficiaries of the first trust. The power of appointment may include the power to appoint trust property to the holder of the power of appointment, the holder's creditors, the holder's estate, the creditors of the holder's estate, or any other person, whether or not that person is a trust beneficiary. This section applies to any trust governed by the laws of this state, including a trust whose governing jurisdiction is transferred to this state. Section 5. That \u00a7 55-1B-2 be amended to read as follows: 55-1B-2.

Any excluded fiduciary is also relieved from any obligation to review or evaluate any direction from a distribution trust advisor or to perform investment or suitability reviews, inquiries, or investigations or to make recommendations or evaluations with respect to any investments to the extent the trust advisor, custodial account owner, or authorized designee of a custodial account owner had authority to direct the acquisition, disposition, or retention of any such investment. If the excluded fiduciary offers such communication to the trust advisor, trust protector, investment trust advisor, or distribution trust advisor or any investment person selected by the investment trust advisor, such action may not be deemed to constitute an undertaking by the excluded fiduciary to monitor or otherwise participate in actions within the scope of the advisor's authority or to constitute any duty to do so. Any excluded fiduciary is also relieved of any duty to communicate with or warn or apprise any beneficiary or third party concerning instances in which the excluded fiduciary would or might have exercised the excluded fiduciary's own discretion in a manner different from the manner directed by the trust advisor, trust protector, investment trust advisor, or distribution trust advisor. Absent clear and convincing evidence to the contrary provisions in the governing instrument, the actions of the excluded fiduciary (such as any communications with the trust advisor and others and carrying out, recording, and reporting actions taken at the trust advisor's direction) pertaining to matters within the scope of authority of the trust advisor, trust protector, investment trust advisor, or distribution trust advisor (such as confirming that the advisor's directions have been carried out and recording and reporting actions taken at the advisor's direction) shall be presumed deemed to be administrative actions taken by the excluded fiduciary solely to allow the excluded fiduciary to perform those duties assigned to the excluded fiduciary under the governing instrument, and such administrative actions may not be deemed to constitute an undertaking by the excluded fiduciary to monitor or otherwise, participate in, or otherwise take any fiduciary responsibility for actions within the scope of authority of the trust advisor, trust protector, investment trust advisor, or distribution trust advisor.

By way of example, if a trustee holds in trust a limited liability company interest but does not manage the limited liability company, the trustee may rely, without limitation, on any tax information received from the manager of the limited liability company or its accountant or agents. The tax information that a trustee may rely on in the above situations may include the following: (1) The accuracy of any information reported on a tax return; (2) A copy of a tax return provided by the tax return preparer or the taxpayer filing the return; (3) The representation of another fiduciary or tax advisor who filed or prepared a tax return as to the amount of any item reported on that return; (4) The settlor's representation whether or not a gift or generation skipping transfer tax form has ever been filed as well as how much of the respective exemptions have been utilized; or (5) The direction from the grantor's or settlor's tax advisors based upon any contribution or distribution, or both, for the appropriate tax filings.

The trustee shall, within a reasonable time after the acceptance of the trusteeship, review trust assets and make and implement decisions concerning the retention and disposition of original pre-existing investments in order to conform to the provisions of this section. The trustee's decision to retain or dispose of an asset may properly be influenced by the asset's special relationship or value to the purposes of the trust or to some or all of the beneficiaries, consistent with the trustee's duty of impartiality. If a trust owns an interest in a closely held entity, and the trust agreement, or other document signed by the settlor or signed by a majority of the current income or principal beneficiaries, if the settlor is deceased, provides that the trustee has no duty to inquire or review the activities of the closely held entity, no trustee is liable to a beneficiary to the extent that the trustee acted in reliance on the provisions of the trust or court order.

If a trust was in existence on or before July 1, 2012, and a collateral document relieved the trustee of the duty to inquire or review the activities of a closely held entity as provided in this section, then the trustee may elect to have this section apply upon providing sixty days written notice of the election to the settlor or to the current income or principal beneficiaries if the settlor is deceased.

In any such action, the attorney general shall be provided notice as provided in \u00a7 21-22-18. Section 24. That \u00a7 55-9-5 be amended to read as follows: 55-9-5. The Except as otherwise set forth in \u00a7 55-9-3, the attorney general shall represent the beneficiaries in all cases arising under this chapter, and it shall be his duty to the attorney general shall enforce such trusts by proper proceedings in the courts. Section 25. That chapter 55-3 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Except as otherwise expressly provided by the terms of a governing instrument specifically addressing the governing law for trust administration or by court order, the laws of South Dakota shall govern the administration of a trust while the trust is administered in South Dakota.

A trustee of a revocable or an irrevocable trust, or of either a directed trust pursuant to chapter 55-1B or a delegated trust pursuant to \u00a7 55-5-16, is not liable to the beneficiaries of the trust or to any other party for any loss arising from the absence of those duties upon the trustee. (b) The trustee of a trust described under subsection (a) of this section which was established prior to the effective date of this section, shall notify the settlor in writing that, unless the settlor provides written notice to the contrary to the trustee within sixty days of the trustee's notice, the provisions of subsection (a) of this section shall apply to the trust. Subsection (a) of this section does not apply if, within sixty days of the trustee's notice, the settlor notifies the trustee that subsection (a) does not apply."}, {"bill_id": 3185,
