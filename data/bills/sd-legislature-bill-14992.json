Primary economic activity means that at least thirty-three and one-third percent of the total family gross income of the owner is derived from the operation of such business. For the purposes of this section, an owner-operated commercial business is any building, structure, or land, which is assessed and taxed as a separate unit, as recorded in the records of the director of equalization. A person may only have one business location on a statewide basis classified as an owner-operated commercial business. If the owner operates the business in less than one hundred percent of the space within the building or structure, the portion of the building or structure so occupied by the owner shall be classified as an owner-operated commercial business. Section 2. That chapter 10-13 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: To be eligible for a property tax classification pursuant to section 1 of this Act, the owner of each business shall submit a certificate to the county director of equalization stating such person is the owner of the property on the legal assessment date. The owner shall submit the certificate by March fifteenth. If the director of equalization classifies the property as an owner-operated commercial business, the property shall retain this classification until such time the owner's eligibility for this classification changes. The owner shall notify the director of equalization if a change in eligibility for this classification occurs. The owner shall sign the certificate under penalty of perjury. The Department of Revenue shall prescribe the form of the certificate. Section 3. That chapter 10-13 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Any person who receives an owner-operated commercial business classification by misrepresenting the facts as to the person's ownership or eligibility for such classification shall be assessed a penalty equal to ten dollars per thousand dollars of valuation on the property, which assessment shall become a perpetual lien on the property pursuant to \u00a7 10-21-33. The person shall be barred from receiving the owner-operated commercial business classification for any property in the state for the following five years. Section 4.

If the district's levies are less than the maximum levies as stated in this section, the levies shall maintain the same proportion to each other as represented in the mathematical relationship at the maximum levies . All levies in this section shall be imposed on valuations where the median level of assessment represents eighty-five percent of market value as determined by the Department of Revenue.
