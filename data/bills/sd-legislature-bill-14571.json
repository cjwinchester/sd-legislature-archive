WHEREAS, the livestock producers of this nation face unprecedented challenges to their ability to earn their livelihood; and WHEREAS, many of the difficulties that livestock producers face are the result of potentially unfair pricing and marketing practices, as well as an ever-increasing degree of concentration and vertical integration in the livestock and meat packing industries by large-scale meat packing conglomerates; and WHEREAS, one particularly troublesome and inequitable practice that works to the disadvantage of livestock producers is the failure to report certain livestock transactions and prices; and WHEREAS, the practice by meat packers of purchasing certain livestock at higher prices on the condition that the the price not be disclosed results in artificially low market prices for all other livestock purchases; and WHEREAS, the practice of nonreporting of price as a condition of the purchase or sale of livestock results in inaccurate and incomplete price information for all livestock buyers and sellers; and WHEREAS, a price discovery mechanism in the livestock and packing industry is essential to establish price equity between independent producers, contract producers and between regions: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the House of Representatives of the Seventy- fourth Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the Senate concurring therein, that the South Dakota Legislature strongly urges full and complete enforcement of the federal Packers and Stockyards Act; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that mandatory price reporting mechanisms are needed to ensure that all livestock contracts, nonnegotiated sales, internal transfers, and market prices paid by packers for livestock, including both beef and hogs, are reported to the U.S. Department of Agriculture so that all livestock buyers and sellers are aware of the conditions under which fair prices can be negotiated."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 14571, "action_date": "1999-02-09T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 81868, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/81868.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 614, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 14571, "action_date": "1999-02-09T19:30:00-06:00", "document_id": 81869, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/81869.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 614, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 14571, "action_date": "1999-02-16T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 81871, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/81871.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 614, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 14571, "action_date": "1999-02-16T19:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 81872, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/81872.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 614, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 14571, "action_date": "1999-02-25T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 81875, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/81875.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to another day", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 614, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 14571, "action_date": "1999-02-25T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 81875, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/81875.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to another day", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 614, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 14571, "action_date": "1999-02-25T08:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 81411, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/81411.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 614, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 14571, "action_date": "1999-03-02T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 81876, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/81876.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 614, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 14571, "action_date": "1999-03-02T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 81876, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/81876.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to 41st legislative day", "journal_page": 841, "committee_id_action": 614, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 42212, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [2204, 2222, 2236, 2248, 2249, 2260, 2261, 2284, 2286, 2298], "Excused": [2211, 2213, 2297]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/14571"}
