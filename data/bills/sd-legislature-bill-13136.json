WHEREAS, South Dakota's economy, the quality of life and the personal mobility of its citizens benefit greatly from federal transportation and highway infrastructure investments; and WHEREAS, the nation's highways are a linked, inter-connected system with the nation as a whole benefiting from federal highway infrastructure investments in rural western states, such as South Dakota, where our Interstate and National Highway Systems provide a bridge for the safe and efficient movement of people and goods across this vast region; and WHEREAS, the benefits from federal highway investments to the nation and the states include: . Improved mobility to support our economy and competitive international position; . Access to the nation's natural resource and agricultural production, its manufactured goods, and our national parks and monuments; . Access and mobility for our national and civil defense forces; . Social progress and quality of life for our citizens; and WHEREAS, South Dakota has an aging Interstate System which needs significant funding for pavement maintenance and replacement; and WHEREAS, federal highway investments are supported entirely by the fees assessed every day on the users of the nation's highways; and WHEREAS, the Federal Highway Trust Fund could support substantially increased investments in highway infrastructure without any increase in fees to the users of the highway system; and WHEREAS, to continue the benefits of transportation and highway infrastructure investments, the Federal Surface Transportation Program must be reauthorized by the United States Congress before the program expires on September 30, 1997: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the House of Representatives of the Seventy- second Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the Senate concurring therein, that the United States Congress is urged to act promptly to reauthorize the Federal Surface Transportation Program; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that this reauthorization include: . Full investment of all Highway Trust Fund balances, interest and revenues in much needed transportation and highway infrastructure; . A high level of support for the nation's most important highways; the Interstate and National Highway System routes; . Fair treatment of rural western states in the distribution of federal highway program funds among the states, considering the national interest in rural and intercity, as well as urban transportation, and recognizing that the rural western states have vast highway systems which benefit the entire nation and few people to support them; . Regulatory reduction and program streamlining to improve the timeliness and cost- effectiveness of highway project delivery; and . Respect for the uniqueness of each state's approach to managing its transportation system where one size does not fit all, so the federal government should refrain from mandating solutions and imposing sanctions on the states; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the President of the Senate and the Speaker of the House of Representatives send a copy of this resolution to the President of the United States, the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives, the President of the United States Senate, and each member of the South Dakota Congressional Delegation."}, {"bill_id": 13136, "bill_version_id": 74230, "bill_version": "Enrolled", "bill_version_date": "1997-03-04T00:00:00-06:00", "bill_text": "March 3, 1997 February 28, 1997"}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 13136, "action_date": "1997-02-28T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": null, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/None.pdf", "status_text": "Concur In resolution", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 541, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 36984, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [1909, 1941, 1942, 1947, 1951, 1973, 1975, 1982, 1985, 1987, 1958, 1943], "Excused": [1971]}}, {"bill_id": 13136, "action_date": "1997-02-28T11:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 72475, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/72475.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 541, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 13136, "action_date": "1997-02-28T11:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 72475, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/72475.pdf", "status_text": "Adopt Resolution", "journal_page": 775, "committee_id_action": 541, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 35476, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [1909, 1941, 1942, 1947, 1951, 1973, 1975, 1982, 1985, 1987, 1958, 1943], "Excused": [1971]}}, {"bill_id": 13136, "action_date": "1997-03-03T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 72934, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/72934.pdf", "status_text": "Adopt Resolution", "journal_page": 801, "committee_id_action": 544, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 35959, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [1886, 1887, 1888, 1890, 1891, 1892, 1894, 1895, 1896, 1897, 1898, 1899, 1900, 1902, 1903, 1904, 1906, 1907, 1909, 1910, 1913, 1914, 1916, 1917, 1918, 1921, 1922, 1923, 1926, 1929, 1931, 1933, 1934, 1936, 1937, 1941, 1942, 1943, 1944, 1947, 1948, 1949, 1950, 1951, 1952, 1953, 1954, 1957, 1958, 1961, 1962, 1963, 1966, 1967, 1970, 1973, 1974, 1975, 1980, 1982, 1983, 1984, 1985, 1987, 1988, 1924], "Excused": [1940, 1964, 1971], "Nay": [1968]}}, {"bill_id": 13136, "action_date": "1997-03-04T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 72937, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/72937.pdf", "status_text": "Concur In resolution", "journal_page": 758, "committee_id_action": 545, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 36439, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [1884, 1885, 1889, 1893, 1901, 1905, 1908, 1911, 1912, 1915, 1919, 1920, 1925, 1928, 1930, 1932, 1935, 1938, 1939, 1945, 1946, 1955, 1956, 1959, 1960, 1965, 1969, 1972, 1976, 1977, 1978, 1979, 1981, 1986], "Excused": [1927]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/13136"}
