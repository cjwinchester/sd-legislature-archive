Any contract for the acquisition, construction, enlargement, improvement, maintenance, equipment, or operation of any airport or any other air navigation aviation facility, made by the governmental agency itself, or through the agency of the department, shall be made pursuant to the laws of this state governing the making of like contracts. Section 30. That \u00a7 50-9-1 be amended to read: 50-9-1. Any person or organization who intends to construct or alter a structure shall submit an application and obtain an approval permit from the commission for any construction or alteration that: (1) Exceeds two hundred feet above ground level; (2) Is within twenty thousand feet of a state approved public airport or military airport that has at least one runway more than three thousand two hundred feet in actual length and the construction or alteration exceeds a one hundred to one surface ratio from any point on the runway; (3) Is within ten thousand feet of a state approved public airport or military airport that has its longest runway no more than three thousand two hundred feet in actual length and the construction or alteration exceeds a fifty to one surface ratio from any point on the runway; (4) Is within five thousand feet of a state approved public heliport and the construction or alteration exceeds a twenty-five to one surface ratio; or (5) Is a highway, railroad, or other traverse way that the prescribed adjusted height exceeds the standards provided in this section. No application is needed if the construction or alteration of a structure would be shielded by an existing structure of a permanent and substantial character within the corporate limits of a municipality or by natural terrain or topographic features of equal or greater height. It must be evident beyond any reasonable doubt that the construction or alteration of the structure so shielded does not adversely affect safety in air navigation. For the purposes of this section, the term, structure, means any object constructed by human action aviation. Any person or organization, who intends to construct or alter a structure that exceeds two hundred feet above ground level and that is outside the zones described in this section and who has obtained a Federal Aviation Administration determination of no hazard, may provide that determination to the commission prior to the start of construction in lieu of the application and permit required by this chapter. Section 31. That \u00a7 50-9-10 be amended to read: 50-9-10. If conflicting jurisdiction arises over the control of the erection of a building, structure, tower, or hazard in relation to an airport, airway, or air navigation airport facility between the commission and any political subdivision of the state, the commission may overrule, change, modify, or amend zoning rules and regulations adopted by any political subdivision or by any airport zoning board created by a political subdivision under the laws of this state, after a public hearing in which all parties have been given an opportunity to be heard. Section 32. That \u00a7 50-9-13 be amended to read: 50-9-13. Any anemometer tower that is fifty feet in height above the ground or higher, that is located outside the exterior boundaries of any municipality, and whose appearance is not otherwise mandated by state or federal law shall be marked, painted, flagged, or otherwise constructed to be recognizable in clear air during daylight hours. Any anemometer tower that was erected before July 1, 2010 shall be marked as required in this section within one year after July 1, 2010. Any anemometer tower that is erected on or after July 1, 2010 shall be marked as required in this section at the time it is erected. Marking required under this section includes marking the anemometer tower, guy wires, and accessory facilities as follows: (1) The top one-third of the anemometer tower shall be painted in equal, alternating bands of aviation orange and white, beginning with orange at the top of the tower and ending with orange at the bottom of the marked portion of the tower; (2) Two marker balls shall be attached to and evenly spaced on each of the outside guy wires; (3) The area surrounding each point where a guy wire is anchored to the ground Where an anemometer tower has guy wires anchored to the ground, the anchor points shall have a contrasting appearance with any surrounding vegetation. If the adjacent land is grazed, the area surrounding the anchor point shall be fenced. For purposes of this section, the term, area surrounding the anchor point, means The fenced area shall be an area not less than sixty-four square feet whose outer boundary is at least four feet from the anchor point; and (4) One or more seven-foot safety sleeves shall be placed at each anchor point and shall extend from the anchor point along each guy wire attached to the anchor point. A violation of this section is a Class 2 misdemeanor. Section 33. That \u00a7 50-10-10 be amended to read: 50-10-10. If advisable to facilitate the enforcement of zoning regulations adopted pursuant to this chapter, a system may be established for granting permits to establish or construct new structures and other uses and to replace existing structures and other uses or make substantial changes therein or substantial repairs thereof. Before any nonconforming structure or tree may be replaced, substantially altered or repaired, rebuilt, allowed to grow higher, or replanted, a permit shall be secured from the administrative agency authorized to administer and enforce the regulations, authorizing such replacement, change, or repair. No permit may be granted that would allow the structure or tree in question to be made higher or become a greater hazard to air navigation aviation than it was when the applicable regulation was adopted. If the administrative agency determines that a nonconforming structure or tree has been abandoned or more than eighty percent physically deteriorated, or decayed, no permit may be granted that would allow the structure or tree to exceed the applicable height limit or otherwise deviate from the zoning regulations. Except as indicated all applications for permits for replacement, change, or repair of nonconforming uses shall be granted. Section 34. That \u00a7 50-10-32 be amended to read: 50-10-32.
