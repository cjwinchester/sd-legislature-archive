No seller who registers to pay or to collect and remit applicable South Dakota sales or use tax in accordance with the terms of the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement is liable for any uncollected or unpaid sales or use tax, penalty or interest, unless the seller was not registered in this state during the twelve-month period preceding the date the state is found in compliance with the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement.

The provisions of section 1 of this Act preclude assessment for any uncollected or unpaid sales or use tax, penalty, or interest for sales made during the period the seller was not registered in the state, if registration occurs within twelve months of the date the state is found in compliance with the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement.
