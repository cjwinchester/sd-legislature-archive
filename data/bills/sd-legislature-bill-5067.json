BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That chapter 12-18 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Any applicant who is eligible to vote may register on election day by appearing in person at the polling place for the precinct in which the applicant maintains residence. The applicant shall answer questions and sign the oath as required by the State Board of Elections pursuant to \u00a7 12-4-6 and complete the affirmation as required by \u00a7 12-18-40. If the applicant has registered to vote pursuant to this section, signed the oath, and completed the affirmation, the applicant may cast a provisional ballot pursuant to chapters 12-18 and 12-20. Section 2. That chapter 12-18 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: A precinct deputy shall conduct voter registration at the polling place on election day. The precinct deputy who registers an applicant at the polling place on election day may not handle that applicant's ballot at any time prior to the opening of the ballot box. Registration cards and forms for oaths shall be available at each polling place. Section 3. That chapter 12-18 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Each registration card completed on election day shall be forwarded to the county auditor. The county auditor shall add the name of each applicant to the registration system unless the information forwarded is substantially deficient. A county auditor who finds an election day registration substantially deficient shall give written notice to the applicant whose registration is found deficient. Section 4. That \u00a7 12-20-5.1 be amended to read as follows: 12-20-5.1. Prior to the official canvass, the person in charge of the election shall determine if the person voting by provisional ballot was legally qualified to vote in the precinct in which the provisional ballot was cast. In making this determination, the person in charge of the election shall consider the information provided on the affirmation and diligently investigate the voter registration status of the person. If the person did not register to vote pursuant to section 1 of this Act and there is no evidence that a voter registration form had been completed by the person showing a residence address in that precinct and returned to an official voter registration site prior to the deadline to register to vote for the election, the provisional ballot is invalid."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 5067, "action_date": "2008-01-15T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 1049, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/1049.pdf", "status_text": "First read in Senate and referred to", "journal_page": 116, "committee_id_action": 28, "committee_id_assigned": 8, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 5067, "action_date": "2008-01-23T08:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 1266, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/1266.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 8, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 5067, "action_date": "2008-01-28T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 1766, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/1766.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 8, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 5067, "action_date": "2008-01-28T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 1963, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/1963.pdf", "status_text": "Motion to amend", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 8, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 734, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [601, 560, 622, 584, 627, 607, 576]}}, {"bill_id": 5067, "action_date": "2008-01-28T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 1963, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/1963.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to the 36th legislative day", "journal_page": 231, "committee_id_action": 8, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 736, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [601, 560, 627, 576], "Nay": [622, 584, 607]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/5067"}
