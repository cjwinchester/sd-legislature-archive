Said The slow-moving vehicle emblem shall be mounted on the rear of a slow-moving vehicle in such a position and condition as to be clearly visible. The slow-moving vehicle may only be operated during daylight hours unless the vehicle is equipped with lights pursuant to \u00a7 32-17-8. A violation of this section is a petty offense. Section 2.

Every motor vehicle, trailer, semitrailer, and pole trailer, except as otherwise provided in this section, and any other vehicle which is being drawn at the end of a combination of vehicles shall be equipped with at least two tail lamps mounted on the rear, which when lighted as required in \u00a7 32-17-4 shall emit a red light plainly visible from a distance of one thousand feet to the rear. However, motor vehicles, trailers, semitrailers, and pole trailers manufactured and assembled prior to July 1, 1973, shall have one tail lamp mounted on the left side of the rear which when lighted as required in \u00a7 32-17-4 shall emit a red light plainly visible from a distance of five hundred feet to the rear.
