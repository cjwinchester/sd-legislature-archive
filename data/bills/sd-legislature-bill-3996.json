BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 51A-6A-17 be amended to read as follows: 51A-6A-17. Except with the written consent of the director, no person may serve as a board member, officer, or key employee of a trust company who has been convicted of any felony or any crime involving fraud, dishonesty, or a breach of trust. Any trust company who willfully violates this prohibition is subject to a civil penalty of one thousand dollars for each day the violation continues. A civil penalty imposed pursuant to this section for a single violation may not exceed fifty thousand dollars. Any civil penalty imposed by the director under this section is subject to review by the commission in accordance with chapter 1-26. As part of any application to obtain authority to transact business as a private trust company, the applicant shall obtain and provide for each proposed incorporator, organizer, board member, manager, officer, and key employee of the proposed company, as applicable, the results of an independent criminal background investigation acceptable to the director, and independent credit report from a consumer reporting agency as described in 15 U.S.C. 1681a(p) as of January 1, 2010, and a report of ongoing or pending litigation. As part of any application to obtain authority to transact trust company business as a public trust company, each proposed incorporator, organizer, board member, manager, officer, and key employee, as applicable, shall submit to a state and federal criminal background investigation by means of fingerprint checks by the Division of Criminal Investigation and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Upon application, the division shall submit completed fingerprint cards to the Division of Criminal Investigation for purposes of conducting both the state and federal criminal background investigation. Upon completion of the criminal background check, the Division of Criminal Investigation shall forward to the division all information obtained as a result of the criminal background investigation. For any person described above who is not a citizen of the United States, the director may conduct an international background investigation or require the applicant or person to obtain and provide the results of an international background investigation acceptable to the director. The applicant shall also obtain and provide the results of an independent credit report from a consumer reporting agency as described in 15 U.S.C. 1681a(p) as of January 1, 2010, and a report of ongoing or pending litigation for each person as described above. Prior to beginning employment with any trust company, each potential director, manager, member, officer, or key employee shall undergo the same investigation process as required above for new applicants. At the discretion of the director, any person subject to the requirements of this section may enter into service on a temporary basis pending receipt of results from the criminal background investigation. For purposes of this section, a key employee does not include an employee whose primary responsibilities are limited to clerical or support duties, and officer does not include any person who is not involved in the ongoing policy making or management of the trust company. Any trust company shall immediately notify the division of any material change in the background of any person subject to the background investigation process as described above. The division may require a fingerprint-based state, federal, and international criminal background investigation, as applicable, for any director, officer, or employee, who is the subject of an investigation by the division. Failure to submit to or cooperate with the criminal background investigation is grounds for the denial of an application or may result in the revocation of a trust company's authority to transact trust company business. The applicant or trust company, as the case may be, shall pay any fees or costs associated with the fingerprinting, background investigations, or reports required by this section. A person who has undergone a state, federal, or international background investigation required by this section, may, at the discretion of the director, be allowed to fulfill this requirement for future trust company employment by sworn affidavit stating that there have been no material changes to the person's background. Section 2. That chapter 51A-6A be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Upon liquidation, abandonment of trust powers, or resignation from all duties exercised pursuant to \u00a7 51A-6A-29, the pledge required by \u00a7 51A-6A-19.2 shall be made available for the reasonable satisfaction of claims involving trust company accounts. Any surplus remaining after the satisfaction of all such claims and costs incurred by the division shall be returned to the trust company. Unless the division has reason to believe that claims are forthcoming, the division shall release any pledge no later than twelve months from the date all affected accounts are moved to a successor trustee, custodian, or administrator. Section 3. That \u00a7 51A-6A-19 be amended to read as follows: 51A-6A-19. For purposes of this section, the capital of a trust company is the total of the aggregate par value of its outstanding shares of capital stock or ownership units, its surplus, and its undivided profits. The minimum capital of a trust company is two hundred thousand dollars. The director may require that the trust company have more capital than the amount specified if the director determines that the amount and character of the anticipated business of the trust company and the safety of the customers so require. This chapter recognizes that capital for a trust company serves a different purpose than does capital for a bank. It is not intended that capital requirements for trust companies be judged by the same standards as banks. Basic protection for fiduciary clients of a trust company shall be provided by the purchase of a fidelity bond and a director's and officer's liability insurance policy. The bond and insurance shall be in an amount of not less than one million dollars each. The bond and insurance required to be secured by a trust company shall provide that any bonding or insurance company providing the bond or insurance coverage shall give at least ninety sixty days notice of cancellation or renewal of the bond or insurance policy to the trust company and to the director. Except as may be provided elsewhere in this chapter, no trust company may reduce voluntarily its capital stock or ownership units or surplus below the amount required in this section. Section 4. That \u00a7 51A-6A-21 be amended to read as follows: 51A-6A-21. The shares of stock and ownership units of any trust company are personal property and shall be transferred on the books of the trust company in such manner as the bylaws or operating regulations of the trust company may direct. No stock or ownership units may be transferred on the books of the trust company when the trust company is in a failing condition, or when its capital is impaired, except upon approval of the director. If a transfer of shares of stock of any trust company, or holding company that owns a majority of the outstanding shares of a trust company, occurs which results through direct or indirect ownership by a stockholder or an affiliated group of stockholders of ten percent or more of the outstanding stock of the trust company, or holding company that owns a majority of the outstanding shares of a trust company, and if additional shares of stock of the trust company are transferred to such stockholders or, affiliated group of stockholders, or holding company, the president or other chief executive officer of the trust company shall report the transfer to the director within ten days after transfer of the shares of stock on the books of the trust company. Section 5. That chapter 51A-6A be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Any trust company shall immediately notify the division of any material omission from the application or any material change in the facts reported in an application, either of which could have led to an unfavorable finding with respect to the criteria established in \u00a7 51A-6A-5. Failure to so notify the division of the material omission from the application or the existence of the material change in facts as reported in the application, either of which could have led to an unfavorable finding with respect to the criteria established in \u00a7 51A-6A-5, may subject the trust company to revocation proceedings or other regulatory action as provided in this title. The director shall give notice of the revocation or other regulatory action to the president or other managing officer of the trust company, and any revocation action shall thereupon proceed according to \u00a7 51A-6A-38. Section 6. That \u00a7 51A-6A-47 be amended to read as follows: 51A-6A-47. A person acquiring control through direct or indirect ownership by an owner or an affiliated group of owners shall give the director at least sixty days prior written notice of any proposed trust company acquisition. If the director does not issue an order disapproving the proposed acquisition within that time or extend the period during which a disapproval may be issued, the proposed acquisition is approved. The period for disapproval shall be thirty days after notice is received by the director and may be further extended only if the director determines that any acquiring person has not furnished all the information required under \u00a7 51A-6A-49 \u00a7 51A-6A-48 or if in the director's judgment, any material information submitted is substantially inaccurate. An acquisition may be made prior to expiration of the disapproval period if the director issues written notice of the director's intent not to disapprove the action. If the director disapproves an acquisition, the director shall serve the acquiring person with an order of disapproval. The order shall provide a statement of the basis for the disapproval. Within thirty days after service of an order of disapproval, the acquiring person may request a hearing on the proposed acquisition with the commission. Upon receipt of a timely request, the commission shall conduct a hearing in accordance with the provisions of chapter 1-26. Any disapproval by the commission of a proposed acquisition is subject to review in accordance with chapter 1-26. Actual expenses incurred by the director or commission in carrying out any investigation that may be necessary or required by statute shall be paid by the person submitting the proposed acquisition.

The director may issue a notice disapproving any application filed pursuant to \u00a7 51A-6A-55 if the director determines the agreement fails to meet a public need and does not serve the public interest.

However, such election by the trustee, the disinterested person, or the court in determining the unitrust amount shall be may not be less than three percent or greater nor more than five percent; (4) The unitrust amount for the current valuation year shall be proportionately reduced for any distributions, in whole or in part, other than distributions of the unitrust amount, and for any payments of expenses, including debts, disbursements and taxes, from the trust within a current valuation year that the trustee determines to be material and substantial, and shall be proportionately increased for the receipt, other than a receipt that represents a return on investment, of any additional property into the trust within a current valuation year; (5) In the case of a short accounting period, the trustee shall prorate the unitrust amount on a daily basis; (6) If the net fair market value of an asset held in the trust has been incorrectly determined either in a current valuation year or in a prior valuation year, the unitrust amount shall be increased in the case of an undervaluation, or be decreased in the case of an overvaluation, by an amount equal to the difference between the unitrust amount determined based on the correct valuation of the asset and the unitrust amount originally determined; (7) In determining the net fair market value of the assets held in trust, the determination may not include the value of any residential property or any tangible personal property that, as of the first business day of the current valuation year, one or more income beneficiaries of the trust have or had the right to occupy, or have or had the right to possess or control, other than in a capacity as trustee, and instead the right of occupancy or the right of possession or control shall be deemed to be the unitrust amount with respect to the residential property or the tangible personal property; or any asset specifically given to a beneficiary under the terms of the trust and the return on investment on that asset, which return on investment shall be distributed to the beneficiary. Section 14. That \u00a7 43-6-7 be amended to read as follows: 43-6-7. No provision directing or authorizing accumulation of trust income is invalid. This section is effective and applies to trust instruments whenever created or executed. Section 15. That chapter 55-1 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: General pecuniary devises bear interest at the Category B rate of interest as provided in \u00a7 54-3-16 beginning one year after the event requiring a distribution until payment, unless a contrary intent is indicated by the terms of the trust. Section 16. That \u00a7 55-2-15 be amended to read as follows: 55-2-15. Unless the terms of the governing instrument expressly provide otherwise, if a trustee has discretion under the terms of a governing instrument to make a distribution of income or principal to or for the benefit of one or more beneficiaries of a trust (the \"first trust\"), whether or not restricted by any standard, then the trustee, independently or with court approval, may instead exercise such discretion by appointing part or all of the income or principal subject to the discretion in favor of a trustee of a second trust (the \"second trust\") under a governing instrument separate from the governing instrument of the first trust. Before exercising its discretion to appoint and distribute assets to a second trust, the trustee of the first trust shall determine whether the appointment is necessary or desirable after taking into account the purposes of the first trust, the terms and conditions of the second trust, and the consequences of the distribution. For the purposes of this section, a trustee of the first trust is a restricted trustee if either the trustee is a beneficiary of the first trust or if a beneficiary of the first trust has a power to change the trustees within the meaning of \u00a7 55-2-17. In addition, the following apply to all appointments made under this section: (1) The second trust may only have as beneficiaries one or more of the beneficiaries of the first trust: (a) To or for whom a discretionary distribution of income or principal may be made from the first trust; or (b) To or for whom a distribution of income or principal may be made in the future from the first trust at a time or upon the happening of an event specified under the first trust; or (c) Both (a) and (b); (2) No restricted trustee of the first trust may exercise such authority over the first trust to the extent that doing so could have the effect of: (a) Benefiting the restricted trustee as a beneficiary of the first trust, unless the exercise of such authority is limited by an ascertainable standard based on or related to health, education, maintenance, or support; or (b) Removing restrictions on discretionary distributions to a beneficiary imposed by the governing instrument under which the first trust was created, except that a provision in the second trust which limits distributions by an ascertainable standard based on or related to the health, education, maintenance, or support of any such beneficiary is permitted, or to a trust established pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396(p)(d)(4); (3) No restricted trustee of the first trust may exercise such authority over the first trust to the extent that doing so would have the effect of increasing the distributions that can be made from the second trust to the restricted trustees of the first trust or to a beneficiary who may change the trustees of the first trust within the meaning of \u00a7 55-2-17 compared to the distributions that can be made to such trustee or beneficiary, as the case may be, under the first trust, unless the exercise of such authority is limited by an ascertainable standard based on or related to health, education, maintenance, or support; (4) The provisions of subdivisions (2) and (3) only apply to restrict the authority of a trustee if either a trustee, or a beneficiary who may change the trustee, is a United States citizen or domiciliary under the Internal Revenue Code, or the trust owns property that would be subject to United States estate or gift taxes if owned directly by such a person; (5) In the case of any trust contributions which have been treated as gifts qualifying for the exclusion from gift tax described in \u00a7 2503(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, by reason of the application of I.R.C. \u00a7 2503(c), the governing instrument for the second trust shall provide that the beneficiary's remainder interest shall vest no later than the date upon which such interest would have vested under the terms of the governing instrument for the first trust; (6) The exercise of such authority may not reduce any income interest of any income beneficiary of any of the following trusts: (a) A trust for which a marital deduction has been taken for federal tax purposes under I.R.C. \u00a7 2056 or \u00a7 2523 or for state tax purposes under any comparable provision of applicable state law; (b) A charitable remainder trust under I.R.C. \u00a7 664; or (c) A grantor retained annuity or unitrust trust under I.R.C. \u00a7 2702; (7) The exercise of such authority does not apply to trust property subject to a presently exercisable power of withdrawal held by a trust beneficiary to whom, or for the benefit of whom, the trustee has authority to make distributions, unless after the exercise of such authority, such the beneficiary's power of withdrawal is unchanged with respect to the trust property; (8) The exercise of such authority is not prohibited by a spendthrift clause or by a provision in the governing instrument that prohibits amendment or revocation of the trust; (9) Any appointment made by a trustee shall be considered a distribution by the trustee pursuant to the trustee's distribution powers and authority; and (10) If the trustee's distribution discretion is not subject to a standard, or if the trustee's distribution discretion is subject to a standard that does not create a support interest, then the court may review the trustee's determination or any related appointment only pursuant to \u00a7 55-1-43. Any other court review of the trustee's determination or any related appointment may be made only pursuant to \u00a7 55-1-42.

An acquisition may be made prior to expiration of the disapproval period if the director issues written notice of the director's intent not to disapprove the action. If the director disapproves an acquisition, the director shall serve the acquiring person with an order of disapproval. The order shall provide a statement of the basis for the disapproval. Within thirty days after service of an order of disapproval, the acquiring person may request a hearing on the proposed acquisition with the commission.

Any other court review of the trustee's determination or any related appointment may be made only pursuant to \u00a7 55-1-42.

The power of appointment may include the power to appoint trust property to the holder of the power of appointment, the holder's creditors, the holder's estate, the creditors of the holder's estate, or any other person, whether or not that person is a trust beneficiary.

If all beneficiaries entitled to notice waive the notice requirement by a signed writing delivered to the trustee, the trustee may exercise the power under \u00a7 55-2-15 immediately. A copy of the proposed exercise of this authority and the second trust agreement shall satisfy this notice obligation provision. For the purposes of this section, the term, beneficiaries, means those persons who would be entitled to notice and a copy of the first trust instrument under \u00a7 55-2-13. Section 18.
