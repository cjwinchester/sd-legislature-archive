Section 12. If the production contract is for crops, the lien established pursuant to section 8 of this Act applies as follows: (1) If the crop is not sold or processed by the contractor, the lien is on the crop; (2) If the crop is sold by the contractor, the lien is on cash sale proceeds.; (3) If the crop is processed by the contractor, the lien is on any property of the contractor that may be subject to a security interest as provided in \u00a7 57A-9-102.; (4) A lien on a crop is created at the time the crop is first planted and continues for one year after the crop, or grain from the crop, is no longer under the custody or control of the contract producer. Section 13. In order to preserve a lien created pursuant to section 8 if this Act, a contract producer shall file a lien statement with the secretary of state on a form prescribed by the secretary of state. A lien statement covering the production of livestock or raw milk, must be filed within forty-five days after the livestock first arrives at the contract livestock facility. A lien statement covering crops must be filed within forty-five days after the crop is first planted. The secretary of state may charge a fee in accordance with the provisions of \u00a7 57A-9-525 for filing the statement. The secretary of state may adopt rules pursuant to chapter 1-26 for the filing and release of lien statements, fees, and electronic filings. Section 14.

A contract producer may foreclose a lien created under section 8 of this Act in the manner provided for the foreclosure of secured transactions in chapter 57A-9. Section 17. A lien created pursuant to this Act has priority over all other liens and encumbrances if filed within forty-five days after the livestock first arrives at the contract facility or within forty-five days after the crop is first planted. Section 18. Sections 19 to 22, inclusive, of this Act only apply to a production contract executed by a contract producer and a contractor, if the contract producer must make capital investments of one hundred thousand dollars or more. The amount of the capital investment is determined by aggregating the investment requirements provided in all production contracts in which the contract producer and the contractor are parties. The value of the capital investments is the total dollar amount spent by the contract producer in satisfying the investment requirements. Section 19. Except as provided in section 21 of this Act, a contractor may not terminate or cancel a production contract until providing the contract producer written notice at least ninety days before the effective date of the termination or cancellation, and the contract producer has been reimbursed for damages incurred due to the termination or cancellation. Damages shall be based on the value of the remaining useful life of the structures, machinery, or equipment involved. Section 20. Except as provided in section 21 of this Act, a contractor may not terminate or cancel a production contract that has been materially breached by a contract producer until the contractor has provided written notice of termination or cancellation at least forty-five days before its effective date, which contains the alleged causes constituting the breach, and the contract producer has failed to remedy each breach within thirty days following receipt of the notice. An effort by a contract producer to remedy an alleged breach may not be construed as an admission of a breach in a civil cause of action. Section 21. A contractor may terminate or cancel a production contract without notice or remedy as required in sections 19 and 20 of this Act if the basis for the termination or cancellation is voluntary abandonment of the contractual relationship by the contract producer by a failure of a contract producer to perform the obligations of a production contract, or the conviction of a contract producer of fraud or theft committed against the contractor. Section 22. If a contractor terminates or cancels a production contract other than provided in sections 19 to 21, inclusive, of this Act, the contractor shall pay the contract producer the value of the remaining useful life of the structures, machinery, or equipment involved. Section 23. For purposes of this Act, the term, contract input, means a commodity or an organic or synthetic substance or compound used to produce a commodity, including livestock or plants, agricultural seeds, semen or eggs for breeding livestock, and fertilizer or pesticide.

Section 25. No contractor or processor may knowingly engage, or permit any employee or agent to engage, in any of the following actions to coerce, intimidate, disadvantage, retaliate against, or discriminate against any producer because the producer exercises, or attempts to exercise, any producer right. Such actions include: (1) The execution, termination, extension, or renewal of an agricultural contract; (2) Treatment of a producer that includes placing discriminatory or preferential terms in an agricultural contract or interpreting terms of an existing agricultural contract in a discriminatory or preferential manner. For purposes of this section, terms includes the price paid for a commodity, the quality or the quantity of a commodity demanded, financing, or investment requirements; (3) The grant or denial of a reward or imposition of a penalty, including financial rewards or penalties such as loans, bonuses, or inducements; (4) The alteration of the quality, quantity, or delivery times of contract inputs provided to a producer; Section 26. No contractor or processor may knowingly do, or permit any employee or agent to do, any of the following: (1) Provide false information to the producer, including that related to the character, financial condition, or management practices of a producer with whom the producer associates, or an association of producers, or an agricultural organization with which the producer is affiliated, or producer rights provide by this Act or other provisions of law; (2) Refuse to provide to a contract producer statistical information and data used to determine the compensation paid under a production contract, including feed conversion rates, feed analyses, or origination and breeder history; (3) Refuse to allow a contract producer or a designated representative to observe at the time of weighing, the weights and measures used to determine the contract producer's compensation under a production contract; (4) Use a contract producer's performance, also known as \"tournament compensation\" to determine the compensation due another contract producer under a production contract, or to use that performance as the basis of the termination, cancellation, or renewal of a production contract; (5) Require a contract producer to make new or additional capital investments in connection with, or to retain, continue, or renew, a production contract. It is not be a violation of this section if such new or additional capital investments are partially paid for by the contractor, or are offset by other compensation or modifications to the original contract agreed to in writing as consideration for the new capital investment; (6) Execute an agricultural contract in violation of the disclosure of risks and readability requirements of sections 3 to 5, inclusive, of this Act; (7) Execute an agricultural contract that includes a confidentiality provision in violation of section 7 of this Act; (8) Execute an agricultural contract without a mediation provision as required under section 29 of this Act; (9) Execute an agricultural contract that includes a waiver of any producer right or any obligation of a contractor or processor established under this Act; (10) Execute an agricultural contract requiring the application of the law of another state. Section 27. Any provision of an agricultural contract that waives a producer right or a contractor or processor obligation established by this Act is void and unenforceable. No such provision affects other provisions of an agricultural contract, related document, policy, or agreement, that can be given effect without the voided provision. Section 28. Any condition, stipulation, or provision of an agricultural contract requiring the application of the law of another state is void and unenforceable. Section 29. An agricultural contract shall contain language providing for resolution of disputes by mediation. Section 30. A contractor or processor committing an unfair practice under sections 23 to 26, inclusive, of this Act is subject to a civil penalty of up to ten thousand dollars per violation. Section 31. A producer who suffers damages because of a contractor's or processor's violation of this Act may obtain appropriate legal and equitable relief, including damages, pursuant to the rules of civil procedure. The court may award the prevailing producer reasonable attorney fees and other litigation expenses. A producer is not required to post a bond, prove the absence of an adequate remedy at law, or show the existence of special circumstances, to obtain temporary or permanent injunctive relief unless the court for good cause otherwise orders. Section 32. In addition to the remedies provided in this Act, a court reviewing an agricultural contract may change the terms of the contract or limit a provision to avoid an unfair result if the court finds: (1) A material provision of the contract violates sections 3 to 5, inclusive, of this Act; (2) The violation caused the producer to be substantially confused about any of the rights, obligations, or remedies of the contract; and (3) The violation has caused or is likely to cause financial detriment to the producer. If the court reforms or limits a provision of an agricultural contract, the court shall also make orders necessary to avoid unjust enrichment. Bringing a claim for relief under this section does not entitle a producer to withhold performance of an otherwise valid contractual obligation. No relief may be granted under this section unless the claim is brought before the obligations of the contract have been fully performed. Section 33. In a proceeding in which civil penalties are claimed from a party for a violation of sections 3 to 5, inclusive, of this Act, it is a defense to the claim that the party made a good faith and reasonable effort to comply. Section 34. Notwithstanding section 31 of this Act, a party who has made a good faith and reasonable effort to comply may not be assessed attorney's fees for violations of sections 3 to 5, inclusive, of this Act. Section 35. Violation of sections 3 to 5, inclusive, of this Act is not a defense to a claim arising from a producer's breach of an agricultural contract. A producer may recover actual damages caused by a violation of sections 3 to 5, inclusive, of this Act only if the violation caused the producer to not understand the rights, obligations, or remedies of the contract. Section 36. A claim that an agricultural contract violates sections 3 to 5, inclusive, of this Act must be raised within six years of the date the contract is executed by the producer. Section 37. In addition to using other appropriate remedies, the attorney general may enforce the provisions of this Act, through injunctive action to restrain a contractor or processor from engaging in conduct or practices in violation of this Act, or to require a contractor or processor to comply with a provision of this Act. To accomplish the objectives and to carry out the provisions of this Act, the attorney general issue a subpoena to any contractor or processor to obtain an agricultural contract. Any person failing to comply with such subpoena may be certified to circuit court, for enforcement by order. Noncompliance with a judicial order shall be treated the same as a contempt of the court. Section 38. The attorney general or state's attorney may also bring an action in circuit court for recovery of civil penalties provided in section 30 of this Act. Section 39. This Act does not apply to: (1) Agricultural contracts based on a sharecropping arrangement or agreement; (2) Agricultural contracts in which all parties executing the contract are producers; (3) Any contract involving forward contracting of livestock or grain entered into with any packer, dairy, milk or milk products processor, public grain warehouse, grain dealer, or grain or livestock exchange or other commodity exchange ; (4) Any contract involving a grain processing cooperative that is exempt under section 521 of the federal Internal Revenue Code as amended to January 1, 2002."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 16962, "action_date": "2002-01-16T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 92223, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/92223.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 148, "committee_id_action": 768, "committee_id_assigned": 754, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 16962, "action_date": "2002-01-24T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 92741, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/92741.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 754, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 16962, "action_date": "2002-01-24T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 92741, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/92741.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to 36th legislative day", "journal_page": 262, "committee_id_action": 754, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 53394, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [2731, 2756, 2764, 2765, 2769, 2774, 2807, 2811, 2814, 2825, 2786, 2748], "Nay": [2779]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/16962"}
