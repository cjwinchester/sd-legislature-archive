Section 2. That chapter 13-53 be amended by adding a NEW SECTION to read: The publicly accessible outdoor areas of an institution are available for expressive activity by students, faculty, their guests, and other members of the university community. In these areas, institutions may maintain reasonable time, place, and manner restrictions, which are narrowly tailored in the service of a significant institutional interest, provided the restrictions employ clear, published, content and viewpoint neutral criteria and provide for alternative means of expression. Restrictions imposed under this section must allow members of the university community to spontaneously and contemporaneously distribute literature, assemble, and engage in expressive activity, provided their conduct is not unlawful and does not significantly disrupt the functioning of the institution. No institution may restrict expressive activity to a designated free speech zone or through policy or otherwise, restrict expressive activities to a particular area of the institution. Nothing in this section limits the rights of any person to engage in expressive activity elsewhere on campus. Nothing in this section enables a person to engage in conduct that intentionally, materially, and substantially disrupts another's expressive activity, if that expressive activity is occurring in an institutional space that is reserved for the activity and is under the exclusive use or control of the other person. A material and substantial disruption occurs when a person, with the intent to or knowledge of doing so, significantly hinders another's expressive activity, prevents the other person from communicating a message, or prevents the transaction of business during a lawful meeting, gathering, or procession by engaging in fighting, violence, or seriously disruptive behavior, or by physically blocking or hindering another person from attending, listening to, viewing, or otherwise participating in an expressive activity. Nothing in this section precludes a person from engaging in conduct that is protected under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution or under S.D. Const., Art. VI, \u00a7\u00a7 4 and 5. Such protected conduct includes: (1) Lawful protests and counter-protests in the outdoor areas of institutions, provided: (a) Those areas are generally accessible to members of the university community; and (b) Those areas have not been reserved in advance for other events; and (2) Minor, brief, or fleeting nonviolent disruptions of events that are isolated and of short duration. Nothing in this section prevents an institution from prohibiting, limiting, or restricting categories of expression that are not protected under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, including true threats, expression intended to provoke and likely to produce imminent lawless action, expression that a court has deemed defamatory, expression that unlawfully violates the confidentiality or privacy of another person, or any expression that constitutes harassment. Section 3. That chapter 13-53 be amended by adding a NEW SECTION to read: Each institution shall, through policy, prohibit a student from harassing another student. An institution may not define harassment more expansively than it is defined in section 1 of this Act. Section 4. That chapter 13-53 be amended by adding a NEW SECTION to read: An institution may not: (1) Deny an ideological, political, or religious student organization any benefit or privilege available to any other student organization; (2) Discriminate against an ideological, political, or religious student organization based on the expression of the organization; or (3) Prohibit an ideological, political, or religious student organization from requiring that its leaders, the members of the organization, or both: (a) Affirm and adhere to the organization's sincerely held beliefs; (b) Comply with the organization's standards of conduct; or (c) Further the organization's mission or purpose, as defined by the organization.

Each institution shall provide training to administrators, faculty, and relevant employees, including security personnel and residence life officials, regarding the institution's freedom of expression policies. Section 6. That chapter 13-53 be amended by adding a NEW SECTION to read: On or before January first of each year, each institution shall prepare a report that sets forth all actions taken by the institution to promote and ensure intellectual diversity and the free exchange of ideas, and to otherwise comply with this Act. The institution shall also: (1) Describe in the report any barriers to free expression within the boundaries of the institution or any reported incidents in which free expression was disrupted, and include: (a) Any attempts to block or prohibit a speaker; (b) Any investigation into students or student organizations based on their speech; and (c) Any disciplinary action that resulted from an incident, provided that any description of an incident involving a student may not include or reveal the student's personally identifiable information; (2) Post the report on the institution's website, in a manner that is readily accessible and clearly defined using a separately identified tab on the website's navigation bar; (3) Make the report searchable by the use of keywords and phrases; (4) Make the report accessible without requiring registration, a user name, a password, or any other identifier; (5) Provide a copy of each report to the Governor, the Board of Regents, and to each member of the Legislature; and (6) If subjected to legal action resulting from an alleged violation of the First Amendment, provide a revised report, together with a copy of any complaint or amended complaint, to the Governor and the members of the Legislature within thirty days.

Section 8.
