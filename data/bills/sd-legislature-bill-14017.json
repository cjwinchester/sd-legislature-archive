Project Citizen Program. WHEREAS, the American experiment of representative, self-governing democracy can only function effectively with the consent and participation of an enlightened, competent, and responsible citizenry; and WHEREAS, the various levels of governing--local, state, and federal--must be understood by citizens if they are to communicate their views and ideas to representatives to shape and implement public policy; and WHEREAS, overwhelming evidence exists that citizens have low opinions about the work of state legislatures and have relatively little knowledge about what their representatives do; and WHEREAS, civic education is essential for citizens to develop a common language and understanding of politics and governing; and WHEREAS, civic education is an important tool to develop the habits of civic virtue including civility, individual responsibility, self-discipline, open-mindedness, compromise, tolerance of others, patience, persistence, compassion, generosity, and loyalty to one's nation and community; and WHEREAS, civic education is most effective when the principles that sustain representative democracy are instilled at an early age; and WHEREAS, We the People . . . Project Citizen civic education program for middle school classes is an effective, successful tool for teaching young citizens how to address state and local community public policy issues by: (1) Identifying a public policy problem in their community; (2) Gathering and evaluating information on the problem; (3) Examining and evaluating solutions; (4) Selecting or developing a proposed public policy; and (5) Developing an action plan; and WHEREAS, classes participating in We the People . . . Project Citizen learn that government and public service cannot just be observed, but must be experienced with hands-on action and communication; and WHEREAS, participation in We the People . . . Project Citizen involves numerous segments of the community in teaching students about the legislative process: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the Senate of the Seventy-third Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the House of Representatives concurring therein, that it is the sense of the Legislature that We the People . . . Project Citizen is an ideal tool to teach young middle school students about the reality and promise of citizenship in a representative democracy; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that it is the sense of the Legislature that We the People . . . Project Citizen is an effective civic education program to which we should devote our attention, support, resources, and continued involvement to ensure its implementation, preservation, and sustained development."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 14017, "action_date": "1998-02-23T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 76792, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/76792.pdf", "status_text": "Adopt Resolution", "journal_page": 648, "committee_id_action": 583, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 39394, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [2121, 2125, 2166, 2140, 2156, 2196, 2179, 2137], "Excused": [2122]}}, {"bill_id": 14017, "action_date": "1998-02-23T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 76792, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/76792.pdf", "status_text": "Place on Consent Calendar", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 583, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 14017, "action_date": "1998-02-24T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 76944, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/76944.pdf", "status_text": "Adopt Resolution", "journal_page": 674, "committee_id_action": 601, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 39436, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [2094, 2095, 2099, 2102, 2103, 2112, 2115, 2118, 2121, 2122, 2125, 2129, 2130, 2135, 2137, 2138, 2140, 2142, 2145, 2148, 2149, 2155, 2156, 2165, 2166, 2169, 2170, 2175, 2179, 2182, 2187, 2188, 2189, 2191, 2196]}}, {"bill_id": 14017, "action_date": "1998-02-25T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 76945, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/76945.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to another day", "journal_page": 945, "committee_id_action": 600, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 14017, "action_date": "1998-02-26T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 76947, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/76947.pdf", "status_text": "Concur In resolution", "journal_page": 958, "committee_id_action": 600, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "F", "vote": {"vote_id": 40906, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [2096, 2098, 2101, 2104, 2105, 2110, 2111, 2119, 2120, 2128, 2139, 2141, 2143, 2144, 2151, 2153, 2154, 2161, 2162, 2163, 2167, 2168, 2171, 2173, 2174, 2176, 2177, 2183, 2185, 2190, 2195, 2197, 2198], "Yea": [2097, 2106, 2107, 2108, 2113, 2114, 2116, 2117, 2123, 2124, 2132, 2133, 2136, 2146, 2147, 2150, 2152, 2157, 2158, 2159, 2164, 2172, 2178, 2180, 2181, 2184, 2186, 2192, 2193, 2194, 2134], "Excused": [2100, 2109, 2126, 2127, 2160], "Absent": [2131]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/14017"}
