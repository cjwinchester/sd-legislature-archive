That chapter 37-24 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: An interactive computer service may, upon its own initiative, block the receipt or transmission through its service of any commercial electronic mail that it reasonably believes is, or will be, sent in violation of this Act. No interactive computer service is liable for any action voluntarily taken in good faith to block the receipt or transmission through its service of any commercial electronic mail which it reasonably believes is, or will be, sent in violation of this Act. Section 5. That chapter 37-24 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: A recipient or a provider of internet access services may bring either or both of the following actions: (1) An action based on a violation of section 2 of this Act to enjoin such violation. (2) An action to recover damages for such a violation in an amount equal to the greater of: (a) The amount of the actual monetary loss; or (b) Five hundred dollars for each violation, not to exceed a total of ten thousand dollars. If the court finds that the defendant willfully, knowingly, or repeatedly violated section 2 of this Act, the court may increase the amount of the award to an amount equal to not more than three times the amount available under this section. In any such action, the court may require an undertaking for the payment of the costs of such action, and assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees, against any party. At the request of any party to an action brought pursuant to this section or any other participant in such an action, the court may issue protective orders and conduct legal proceedings in such a way as to protect the secrecy and security of the computer, computer network, computer data, computer program, and computer software involved in order to prevent possible recurrence of the same or a similar act by another person and to protect any trade secrets of any such party or participant."}, {"bill_id": 17448, "bill_version_id": 94935, "bill_version": "Enrolled", "bill_version_date":
