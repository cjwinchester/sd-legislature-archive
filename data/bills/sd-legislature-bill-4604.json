Section 4. The secretary of state shall collect the following fees for copying and certifying a copy of any document filed under this Act: (1) One dollar a page for copying; and (2) Ten dollars for a certificate. Section 5. Whenever a provision of this Act other than subdivision (4) of section 15 of this Act requires that a filing state an address, the filing must state: (1) An actual street address or rural route box number in this state; and (2) A mailing address in this state, if different from the address under subdivision (1). Section 6. A registered agent filing must state: (1) The name of the represented entity's commercial registered agent; or (2) If the entity does not have a commercial registered agent: (a) The name and address of the entity's noncommercial registered agent; or (b) The title of an office or other position with the entity if service of process is to be sent to the person holding that office or position, and the address of the business office of that person. The appointment of a registered agent pursuant to subdivision (1) or subsection (2)(a) is an affirmation by the represented entity that the agent has consented to serve as such. Section 7. An individual or a domestic or foreign entity may become listed as a commercial registered agent by filing with the secretary of state a commercial registered agent listing statement signed by or on behalf of the person which states: (1) The name of the individual or the name, type, and jurisdiction of organization of the entity; (2) That the person is in the business of serving as a commercial registered agent in this state; and (3) The address of a place of business of the person in this state to which service of process and other notice and documents being served on or sent to entities represented by it may be delivered. A commercial registered agent listing statement may include the information regarding acceptance of service of process in a record by the commercial registered agent provided for in section 18 of this Act. If the name of a person filing a commercial registered agent listing statement is not distinguishable on the records of the secretary of state from the name of another commercial registered agent listed under this section, the person must adopt a fictitious name that is distinguishable and use that name in its statement and when it does business in this state as a commercial registered agent. A commercial registered agent listing statement takes effect on filing. Section 8. The secretary of state shall note the filing of the commercial registered agent listing statement in the index of filings maintained by the secretary of state for each entity represented by the registered agent at the time of the filing. The statement has the effect of deleting the address of the registered agent from the registered agent filing of each of those entities. Section 9. A commercial registered agent may terminate its listing as a commercial registered agent by filing with the secretary of state a commercial registered agent termination statement signed by or on behalf of the agent which states: (1) The name of the agent as currently listed under section 7 of this Act; and (2) That the agent is no longer in the business of serving as a commercial registered agent in this state. A commercial registered agent termination statement takes effect on the thirty-first day after the day on which it is filed. The commercial registered agent shall promptly furnish each entity represented by it with notice in a record of the filing of the commercial registered agent termination statement. Section 10. When a commercial registered agent termination statement takes effect, the registered agent ceases to be an agent for service of process on each entity formerly represented by it. Until an entity formerly represented by a terminated commercial registered agent appoints a new registered agent, service of process may be made on the entity as provided in sections 16 to 19, inclusive, of this Act. Termination of the listing of a commercial registered agent under this section does not affect any contractual rights a represented entity may have against the agent or that the agent may have against the entity. Section 11. A represented entity may change the information currently on file under section 6 of this Act by filing with the secretary of state a statement of change signed on behalf of the entity which states: (1) The name of the entity; and (2) The information that is to be in effect as a result of the filing of the statement of change. The interest holders or governors of a domestic entity need not approve the filing of: (1) A statement of change under this section; or (2) A similar filing changing the registered agent or registered office of the entity in any other jurisdiction. The appointment of a registered agent pursuant to this section is an affirmation by the represented entity that the agent has consented to serve as such. A statement of change filed under this section takes effect on filing. As an alternative to using the procedures in this section, a represented entity may change the information currently on file under section 6 of this Act by amending its most recent registered agent filing in the manner provided by the laws of this state other than this Act for amending that filing. Section 12. If a noncommercial registered agent changes its name or its address as currently in effect with respect to a represented entity pursuant to section 6 of this Act, the agent shall file with the secretary of state, with respect to each entity represented by the agent, a statement of change signed by or on behalf of the agent which states: (1) The name of the entity; (2) The name and address of the agent as currently in effect with respect to the entity; (3) If the name of the agent has changed, its new name; and (4) If the address of the agent has changed, the new address. A statement of change filed under this section takes effect on filing. A noncommercial registered agent shall promptly furnish the represented entity with notice in a record of the filing of a statement of change and the changes made by the filing. Section 13. If a commercial registered agent changes its name, its address as currently listed under section 7 of this Act, or its type or jurisdiction of organization, the agent shall file with the secretary of state a statement of change signed by or on behalf of the agent which states: (1) The name of the agent as currently listed under section 7 of this Act; (2) If the name of the agent has changed, its new name; (3) If the address of the agent has changed, the new address; and (4) If the type or jurisdiction of organization of the agent has changed, the new type or jurisdiction of organization. The filing of a statement of change under this section is effective to change the information regarding the commercial registered agent with respect to each entity represented by the agent. A statement of change filed under this section takes effect on filing. A commercial registered agent shall promptly furnish each entity represented by it with notice in a record of the filing of a statement of change relating to the name or address of the agent and the changes made by the filing. Section 14. If a commercial registered agent changes its address without filing a statement of change as required by section 13 of this Act, the secretary of state may cancel the listing of the agent. Such cancellation has the same effect as a termination. Promptly after canceling the listing of an agent, the secretary of state shall serve notice in a record on: (1) Each entity represented by the agent, stating that the agent has ceased to be an agent for service of process on the entity and that, until the entity appoints a new registered agent, service of process may be made on the entity as provided in sections 16 to 19, inclusive, of this Act; and (2) The agent, stating that the listing of the agent has been canceled under this section. Section 15. A registered agent may resign at any time with respect to a represented entity by filing with the secretary of state a statement of resignation signed by or on behalf of the agent which states: (1) The name of the entity; (2) The name of the agent; (3) That the agent resigns from serving as agent for service of process for the entity; and (4) The name and address of the person to which the agent will send notice. A statement of resignation takes effect on the earlier of the thirty-first day after the day on which it is filed or the appointment of a new registered agent for the represented entity. The registered agent shall, pursuant to subdivision (4), promptly furnish the represented entity notice in a record of the date on which a statement of resignation was filed. When a statement of resignation takes effect, the registered agent ceases to have responsibility for any matter tendered to it as agent for the represented entity. A resignation under this section does not affect any contractual rights the entity has against the agent or that the agent has against the entity. A registered agent may resign with respect to a represented entity whether or not the entity is in good standing. Section 16. A registered agent is an agent of the represented entity authorized to receive service of any process, notice, or demand required or permitted by law to be served on the entity. If an entity that previously filed a registered agent filing with the secretary of state no longer has a registered agent, or if its registered agent cannot with reasonable diligence be served, the entity may be served by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, addressed to the governors of the entity by name at its principal office in accordance with any applicable judicial rules and procedures. The names of the governors and the address of the principal office may be as shown in the most recent annual report filed with the secretary of state. Service is perfected under this section at the earliest of: (1) The date the entity receives the mail; (2) The date shown on the return receipt, if signed on behalf of the entity; or (3) Five days after its deposit with the United States Postal Service, if correctly addressed and with sufficient postage. Section 17. If process, notice, or demand cannot be served on an entity pursuant to section 16 of this Act, service of process may be made by handing a copy to the manager, clerk, or other person in charge of any regular place of business or activity of the entity if the person served is not a plaintiff in the action. Section 18. Service of process, notice, or demand on a registered agent must be in the form of a written document, except that service may be made on a commercial registered agent in such other forms of a record, and subject to such requirements as the agent has stated from time to time in its listing under section 7 of this Act that it will accept. Section 19. Service of process, notice, or demand may be perfected by any other means prescribed by law other than this Act. Section 20. The only duties under this Act of a registered agent that has complied with this Act are: (1) To forward to the represented entity at the address most recently supplied to the agent by the entity any process, notice, or demand that is served on the agent; (2) To provide the notices required by this Act to the entity at the address most recently supplied to the agent by the entity; (3) If the agent is a noncommercial registered agent, to keep current the information required by section 6 of this Act in the most recent registered agent filing for the entity; and (4) If the agent is a commercial registered agent, to keep current the information listed for it under section 7 of this Act. Section 21. The appointment or maintenance in this state of a registered agent does not by itself create the basis for personal jurisdiction over the represented entity in this state. The address of the agent does not determine venue in an action or proceeding involving the entity. Section 22. In applying and construing this Act, consideration must be given to the need to promote consistency of the law with respect to its subject matter among states that enact it. Section 23. This Act modifies, limits, and supersedes the federal Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act, 15 U.S.C. Section 7001, et seq., but does not modify, limit, or supersede Section 101(c) of that act, 15 U.S.C. Section 7001(c), or authorize delivery of any of the notices described in Section 103(b) of that act, 15 U.S.C. Section 7003(b). Section 24.

Information in the annual report must be current as of the date the annual report is executed on behalf of the filing entity or qualified foreign entity. Any other provisions of law notwithstanding the annual report may be executed by any authorized person. Section 25. The first annual report shall be delivered to the Office of the Secretary of State before the first day of the second month of the year following the year in which a filing entity or qualified foreign entity, except a bank organized pursuant to \u00a7 51A-3-1.1 and limited partnership organized pursuant to chapter 48-7, was authorized to transact business. The subsequent annual report shall be delivered to the Office of the Secretary of State by the same date each subsequent year. Section 26. If an annual report does not contain the information required by section 24 of this Act, the secretary of state shall promptly notify the filing entity or qualified foreign entity in writing and return the report to it for correction. If the report is corrected to contain the information required by section 24 of this Act and delivered to the Office of the Secretary of State within thirty days after the effective date of notice, it is deemed to be timely filed.

If the name of a person filing a commercial registered agent listing statement is not distinguishable on the records of the secretary of state from the name of another commercial registered agent listed under this section, the person must adopt a fictitious name that is distinguishable and use that name in its statement and when it does business in this state as a commercial registered agent. A commercial registered agent listing statement takes effect on filing. Section 8. The secretary of state shall note the filing of the commercial registered agent listing statement in the index of filings maintained by the secretary of state for each entity represented by the registered agent at the time of the filing. The statement has the effect of deleting the address of the registered agent from the registered agent filing of each of those entities. Section 9.

Until an entity formerly represented by a terminated commercial registered agent appoints a new registered agent, service of process may be made on the entity as provided in sections 16 to 19, inclusive, of this Act.

The interest holders or governors of a domestic entity need not approve the filing of: (1) A statement of change under this section; or (2) A similar filing changing the registered agent or registered office of the entity in any other jurisdiction. The appointment of a registered agent pursuant to this section is an affirmation by the represented entity that the agent has consented to serve as such. A statement of change filed under this section takes effect on filing. As an alternative to using the procedures in this section, a represented entity may change the information currently on file under section 6 of this Act by amending its most recent registered agent filing in the manner provided by the laws of this state other than this Act for amending that filing. Section 12. If a noncommercial registered agent changes its name or its address as currently in effect with respect to a represented entity pursuant to section 6 of this Act, the agent shall file with the secretary of state, with respect to each entity represented by the agent, a statement of change signed by or on behalf of the agent which states: (1) The name of the entity; (2) The name and address of the agent as currently in effect with respect to the entity; (3) If the name of the agent has changed, its new name; and (4) If the address of the agent has changed, the new address.

The filing of a statement of change under this section is effective to change the information regarding the commercial registered agent with respect to each entity represented by the agent. A statement of change filed under this section takes effect on filing. A commercial registered agent shall promptly furnish each entity represented by it with notice in a record of the filing of a statement of change relating to the name or address of the agent and the changes made by the filing. Section 14. If a commercial registered agent changes its address without filing a statement of change as required by section 13 of this Act, the secretary of state may cancel the listing of the agent. Such cancellation has the same effect as a termination. Promptly after canceling the listing of an agent, the secretary of state shall serve notice in a record on: (1) Each entity represented by the agent, stating that the agent has ceased to be an agent for service of process on the entity and that, until the entity appoints a new registered agent, service of process may be made on the entity as provided in sections 16 to 19, inclusive, of this Act; and (2) The agent, stating that the listing of the agent has been canceled under this section.

The registered agent shall, pursuant to subdivision (4), promptly furnish the represented entity notice in a record of the date on which a statement of resignation was filed. When a statement of resignation takes effect, the registered agent ceases to have responsibility for any matter tendered to it as agent for the represented entity. A resignation under this section does not affect any contractual rights the entity has against the agent or that the agent has against the entity. A registered agent may resign with respect to a represented entity whether or not the entity is in good standing. Section 16. A registered agent is an agent of the represented entity authorized to receive service of any process, notice, or demand required or permitted by law to be served on the entity. If an entity that previously filed a registered agent filing with the secretary of state no longer has a registered agent, or if its registered agent cannot with reasonable diligence be served, the entity may be served by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, addressed to the governors of the entity by name at its principal office in accordance with any applicable judicial rules and procedures.

Section 18. Service of process, notice, or demand on a registered agent must be in the form of a written document, except that service may be made on a commercial registered agent in such other forms of a record, and subject to such requirements as the agent has stated from time to time in its listing under section 7 of this Act that it will accept. Section 19. Service of process, notice, or demand may be perfected by any other means prescribed by law other than this Act. Section 20. The only duties under this Act of a registered agent that has complied with this Act are: (1) To forward to the represented entity at the address most recently supplied to the agent by the entity any process, notice, or demand that is served on the agent; (2) To provide the notices required by this Act to the entity at the address most recently supplied to the agent by the entity; (3) If the agent is a noncommercial registered agent, to keep current the information required by section 6 of this Act in the most recent registered agent filing for the entity; and (4) If the agent is a commercial registered agent, to keep current the information listed for it under section 7 of this Act. Section 21. The appointment or maintenance in this state of a registered agent does not by itself create the basis for personal jurisdiction over the represented entity in this state. The address of the agent does not determine venue in an action or proceeding involving the entity. Section 22. In applying and construing this Act, consideration must be given to the need to promote consistency of the law with respect to its subject matter among states that enact it. Section 23.
