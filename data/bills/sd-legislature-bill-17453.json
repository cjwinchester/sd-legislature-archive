For the purposes of this Act, the term, standard guidelines, means the child visitation guidelines established by court rules promulgated by the South Dakota Supreme Court pursuant to section 2 of this Act. Section 2. The South Dakota Supreme Court shall promulgate court rules establishing standard guidelines to be used statewide for child visitation in divorce or separate maintenance actions or any other custody action or proceeding. The standard guidelines shall provide a framework for child visitation including frequency and time for child visitation; hours or days of visitation; definitions for weekends, holidays, birthdays, and other special occasions; and time periods for summer visitations. In establishing the standard guidelines, the court may consider varying ages and circumstances of children and treat varying ages and circumstances differently. Section 3. Upon the filing of a summons and complaint for divorce or separate maintenance or any other custody action or proceeding, the plaintiff shall also file and serve upon the defendant a copy of the standard guidelines. Any minor child of the marriage shall remain in the custody of the parent who has been the primary caregiver for the minor child for the majority of time in the thirty days preceding the filing of the summons and complaint, unless the parties agree otherwise.

The court shall issue its temporary custody and visitation order after considering the best interests of the child consistent with the provisions of \u00a7 25-4-45. Section 6. The standard guidelines are subject to any provision established by a South Dakota state court in the following: a temporary or permanent domestic protection order, an order arising out of an abuse or neglect proceeding, a bond condition arising out of a criminal case, and an order in any other proceeding affecting child custody or support. Section 7. The court may order either party to pay attorney fees and costs in an action filed under this Act in accordance with \u00a7 15-17-38 or any other applicable statute. Section 8.
