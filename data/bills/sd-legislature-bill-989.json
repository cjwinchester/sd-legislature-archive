BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. There is hereby created within the Department of Education the dual credit grant program. Section 2. The secretary of education shall award a dual credit grant to any school district that implements the Governor's High School 2025 Initiative within its schools. Any school district receiving a grant shall then award the grant money to high school students enrolled in courses at either a university or technical school for which they are earning both high school credit and postsecondary credit pursuant to \u00a7 13-28-37. The students shall use the grant money to pay the cost of tuition for the courses. Any school district receiving a grant may award up to two hundred fifty dollars in grant money for each dual credit course in which a student enrolls, and each student is eligible to receive grant money for up to four dual credit courses in any academic year. However, no school district receiving a grant may award grant money for any dual credit course for which the credits earned are not transferable under the terms of an articulation agreement reached pursuant to \u00a7 13-53-44. Section 3. Each school district receiving a dual credit grant shall report to the Department of Education the number of dual credit courses that were taken by students enrolled in the district, the number of students in the school district enrolled in dual credit courses, and the amount of money awarded to each student enrolled in dual credit courses. Section 4. There is hereby appropriated from the general fund the sum of one dollar ($ 1 ), or so much thereof as may be necessary, to the Department of Education for the dual credit grant program. Section 5. The secretary of education shall approve vouchers and the state auditor shall draw warrants to pay expenditures authorized by this Act. Section 6. Any amounts appropriated in this Act not lawfully expended or obligated by June 30, 2010 , shall revert in accordance with the procedures prescribed in chapter 4-8. Section 7. For fiscal years 2011 and 2012, the secretary of education shall, in each year, expend one dollar for the dual credit grant program from funds appropriated through the general appropriations act. Section 8. If, in any of the three years, the total funds available to finance the grant awards are insufficient to provide each eligible public high school student with the full grant award for each eligible dual credit course in which the student enrolls, the secretary of education shall prorate the funds when distributing them to eligible school districts, and the eligible school districts shall prorate the grant awards given to students in the school district for dual credit courses."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 989, "action_date": "2009-01-29T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 6340, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/6340.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 185, "committee_id_action": 56, "committee_id_assigned": 43, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 989, "action_date": "2009-02-09T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 6836, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/6836.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 43, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 989, "action_date": "2009-02-09T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 6996, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/6996.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to the 41st legislative day", "journal_page": 310, "committee_id_action": 43, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 3721, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [720, 688, 708, 712, 724, 652, 714, 736, 728, 658, 723, 684, 696], "Excused": [729, 678]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/989"}
