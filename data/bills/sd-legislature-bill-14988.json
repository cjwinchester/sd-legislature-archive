If the participating unit is the legislative branch of state government, the judicial branch of state government, the executive branch of state government, the Board of Regents, or a constitutional office, the written notice shall be delivered by the Executive Board of the Legislative Research Council, the Chief Justice, the Governor, the executive director of the Board of Regents, or the constitutional officer, respectively.
