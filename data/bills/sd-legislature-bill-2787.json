BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 13-6-97 be repealed. 13-6-97. Any school district that has a fall enrollment, as defined in \u00a7 13-13-10.1, of less than one hundred and is not a sparse school district, as defined in \u00a7 13-13-78, shall reorganize with another school district or school districts to create a newly reorganized school district with a fall enrollment of one hundred or greater. Any school district that is not sparse and has a fall enrollment of one hundred or less on July 1, 2007, shall prepare a plan for reorganization by June 30, 2009. After July 1, 2007, if the fall enrollment of any school district that is not sparse falls to one hundred or below, that school district shall prepare a plan for reorganization within two years. If any such district fails to prepare a plan for reorganization by the deadline, the Board of Education shall prepare a reorganization plan for the district. However, the provisions of this section do not apply to any school district that contracts with a school district in another state pursuant to \u00a7 13-15-11 to provide for the education of children in grades seven through twelve who reside within the district, that receives no foundation program state aid distributed pursuant to chapter 13-13, and that is located at least twenty-five miles from the nearest high school in an adjoining school district in the state. Section 2. That \u00a7 13-15-30 be amended to read as follows: 13-15-30. Notwithstanding the provisions of \u00a7 13-5-1, the school board of any school district that offers an instructional program within the boundaries of the school district may enter into an agreement or contract with one or more school boards of other school districts to provide for the whole-grade sharing of students among the participating school districts if: (1) The school district offers an instructional program within the boundaries of the school district; and (2) The school district meets the minimum fall enrollment requirements pursuant to \u00a7 13-6-97. For purposes of \u00a7\u00a7 13-15-30 to 13-15-32, inclusive, whole-grade sharing is a sharing arrangement for students among participating school districts that allows the resident students at any one or more grade levels within one school district to attend school in one or more of the other participating school districts. The whole-grade sharing may be one-way whereby a participating school district sends all of its students at one or more grade levels to attend school in one or more of the other participating school districts without receiving any students in return. The whole-grade sharing may also be two-way whereby a school district sends all of its students at one or more grade levels to attend school in one or more of the other participating school districts, and in return receives students at one or more grade levels from one or more of the other participating school districts."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 2787, "action_date": "2011-01-31T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 16039, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/16039.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 222, "committee_id_action": 115, "committee_id_assigned": 102, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 2787, "action_date": "2011-02-16T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 16818, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/16818.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 102, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 2787, "action_date": "2011-02-16T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 16939, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/16939.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass", "journal_page": 410, "committee_id_action": 102, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 9088, "president_vote": null, "Excused": [48, 96], "Yea": [94, 11, 62, 28, 102, 99, 86, 74, 29, 101], "Nay": [95, 69, 33]}}, {"bill_id": 2787, "action_date": "2011-02-17T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 17097, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/17097.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to another day", "journal_page": 454, "committee_id_action": 115, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 2787, "action_date": "2011-02-22T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 17213, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/17213.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass", "journal_page": 473, "committee_id_action": 115, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 9329, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [12, 53, 17, 21, 72, 60, 87, 1, 48, 51, 49, 15, 59, 36, 7, 94, 104, 84, 88, 90, 57, 11, 63, 70, 96, 62, 54, 20, 71, 92, 28, 83, 58, 85, 103, 3, 32, 102, 98, 67, 99, 64, 73, 14, 6, 86, 93, 74, 97, 29, 101, 66, 100, 89, 65, 47, 5], "Nay": [56, 33, 105, 23, 39, 37, 95, 68, 69, 50, 35, 91], "Excused": [61]}}, {"bill_id": 2787, "action_date": "2011-02-23T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 17282, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/17282.pdf", "status_text": "First read in Senate and referred to", "journal_page": 501, "committee_id_action": 113, "committee_id_assigned": 91, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 2787, "action_date": "2011-03-01T08:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 17346, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/17346.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 91, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 2787, "action_date": "2011-03-01T08:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 17616, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/17616.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to the 41st legislative day", "journal_page": 567, "committee_id_action": 91, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 9674, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [30, 27, 24], "Yea": [26, 82, 52, 77]}}]}
