BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That chapter 13-55 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: There is established the regents scholarship program to be administered by the Board of Regents. The purpose of the program is to allow South Dakota's most academically accomplished high school graduates to receive an affordable education at any university, college, or technical school that is accredited by the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools and that provides instruction from a campus located in South Dakota. Section 2. In order to be eligible for a regents scholarship award, a student shall: (1) Be a resident of South Dakota at the time of graduation from high school; (2) Have a composite score of 24, or higher, on the test administered by the American College Testing Program or a verbal-mathematics score of 1070-1100, on the Scholastic Assessment Test; (3) Meet the high school course requirements as provided in Board of Regents Policy Number 2:3(2)(F) as in effect on January 1, 2003; (4) Attend a university, college, or technical school that is accredited by the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools and that provides instruction from a campus located in South Dakota; and (5) Enter into the program within one year of graduation from high school. A student is eligible to participate in the regents scholarship program for the equivalent of four academic years (eight consecutive spring and fall terms) or until the attainment of a baccalaureate or technical degree, whichever comes first. However, the executive director of the Board of Regents may grant exceptions to the continuous enrollment requirements for good cause shown. Section 3. If it is determined that a student cannot complete the high school course requirements as provided in Board of Regents Policy Number 2:3(2)(F) as in effect on January 1, 2003, due to the unavailability of the courses of study at the student's high school, the student may be admitted into the regents scholarship program. Section 4. One-half of the annual scholarship award shall be paid to the institutions on behalf of the eligible student at the beginning of the fall or spring semester. The amount of the annual award shall be as follows: (1) One thousand dollars for the first year of attendance; (2) One thousand dollars for the second year of attendance; (3) One thousand five hundred dollars for the third year of attendance; (4) Two thousand five hundred dollars for the fourth year of attendance. The total amount of the scholarship may not exceed six thousand dollars. Section 5. In order to maintain eligibility, a student shall: (1) Maintain a cumulative 3.0 grade point average on a 4.0 scale. Cumulative grade point average shall be calculated after the second semester and every semester thereafter. The student shall complete consecutive spring and fall terms in order to remain eligible for continuation of the scholarship program from term to term. Once a student's cumulative grade point average falls below 3.0 on a 4.0 scale, the student permanently loses eligibility for continuation in the scholarship program; (2) Complete fifteen credit hours of instruction per semester. The student shall enroll in and complete at least fifteen credit hours of instruction in each consecutive spring and fall term. If the executive director of the Board of Regents determines that a student's failure to enroll or to maintain continued enrollment occurred as a direct result of legitimate factors outside the student's control, or has resulted from the student's participation in an activity that in the executive director's judgment provides knowledge or experience that will enhance the student's academic pursuits, the executive director may extend the student's eligibility to participate in the program for up to two additional years, if the student does not enroll in a noneligible institution; (3) Sit for and pass all sections of a college proficiency exam as required by Board of Regents Policy Number 2.28 as in effect on January 1, 2003, at the end of the sophomore year. The Board of regents may review and adjust the proficiency examinations administered in keeping with sound academic practice. If such changes are made, the Board of Regents shall notify all eligible institutions of new testing standards or requirements. If the student fails to pass the proficiency examinations the first time, eligibility is forfeited for continuation in the scholarship program; and (4) Certify not to use tobacco products for the entire term in which the student will be participating in the regents scholarship. Failure to comply with this subdivision shall result in loss of eligibility. Section 6. There is hereby continuously appropriated from the general fund to the Board of Regents such sums as may be necessary to finance the scholarships granted pursuant to this Act. The Legislature may dedicate to the purposes of this Act moneys deposited into the general fund from the education enhancement trust fund created in S.D. Const., Art. XII, \u00a7 6, or as contemplated in \u00a7 5-12-60, from the permanent tobacco settlement development trust fund created by \u00a7 5-12-57, the tobacco settlement residual fund created by \u00a7 5 12-58, and the tobacco development interest fund created by \u00a7 5-12-59, or any replacement or successor funds or accounts created by law.
