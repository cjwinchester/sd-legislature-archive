The Board of Regents shall set a high school dual credit tuition rate equivalent to forty-three percent of the undergraduate off-campus tuition rate. The student taking the course shall pay an amount equal to thirty-three and three tenths percent of the total high school dual credit tuition rate and a school district may pay any portion of the student's share.
