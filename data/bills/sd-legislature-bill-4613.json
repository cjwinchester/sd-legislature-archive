That \u00a7 13-11-10 be amended to read as follows: 13-11-10. In implementing the terms of \u00a7 13-11-9, a separate weighted average tax levy of the receiving districts shall be calculated for agricultural property, nonagricultural acreage property, owner-occupied single-family dwelling property, and for nonagricultural property for each sending school district as follows: (1) The levy per thousand dollars of taxable valuation for agricultural property for each receiving school district shall be multiplied by the number of children from the sending school district to whom the receiving school district is providing educational services; (2) Add together the products from subdivision (1) for each receiving school district; (3) Divide the sum from subdivision (2) by the total number of students that the contracting school district is sending to the receiving school districts pursuant to \u00a7 13-15-1.3.

If the district's levies are less than the maximum levies as stated in this section, the levies shall maintain the same proportion to each other as represented in the mathematical relationship at the maximum levies .

The annual cash rent is the annual cash rent, excluding the per acre tax on agricultural land, determined through an analysis of arms-length rental agreements collected within the county in the three years prior to the year for which the agricultural income value is being determined. The agricultural income value of cropland shall be based on average rents over a three-year period for cropland under natural conditions. The agricultural income value of noncropland shall be based on average rents over a three-year period for noncropland under natural conditions. However, no arms-length rental agreements for irrigated land may be used to determine the annual cash rent pursuant to this section. The annual cash rent shall be capitalized at seven and three-fourths four percent. The secretary of revenue and regulation may enter into a contract for the collection of cash rent information by county. Cash rent information shall be adjusted by soil survey statistics, if available, and pursuant to \u00a7 10-6-33.26. Section 12. Any agricultural land, as defined in \u00a7 10-6-31.3, that is sold and the assessor determines such agricultural land will have a change in use and will be transferred to another classification of property, may not be used for the purpose of valuing agricultural land. The sale of any agricultural land that is not used for purpose of valuing agricultural property pursuant to this section may not be used in any sales ratio study. Section 13.

The proceeds derived from such levy shall constitute a school district special education fund of the district for the payment of costs for the special education of all children in need of special education or special education and related services who reside within the district pursuant to the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 13-37-8.2 to 13-37-8.10, inclusive. The levy in this section shall be based on valuations such that the median level of assessment represents 85% of market value as determined by the Department of Revenue and Regulation. The total amount of taxes that would be generated at the levy pursuant to this section shall be considered local effort.
