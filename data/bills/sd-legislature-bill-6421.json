Any motor vehicle, trailer, or semitrailer whose title has been marked by another state or jurisdiction, shall receive a title, which shall contain the similar damage disclosure information as set forth in \u00a7\u00a7 32-3-51.7 and 32-3-51.8. However, if the title has been branded as salvage or with any other similar brand by another state or jurisdiction the applicant shall receive a salvage title or, at the option of the owner, a junking certificate. Section 2. That \u00a7 32-3-51.7 be repealed. 32-3-51.7. Each certificate of title issued by the department shall contain the following phrase: South Dakota state law requires the disclosure of damage on motor vehicles. This information is available upon written request from the Department of Revenue, Division of Motor Vehicles. Each certificate of title shall also contain on its front a statement as to whether previous damage disclosure statements indicate the motor vehicle had been damaged at one time in excess of five thousand dollars as provided by \u00a7 32-3-51.8. Section 3. That \u00a7 32-3-51.8 be repealed. 32-3-51.8. Upon the sale, transfer, trade-in, or titling of a motor vehicle, the seller, transferor, trader, or person wishing to title in South Dakota shall submit an accurately completed damage disclosure statement. The completed damage disclosure statement may be on the back of the certificate of title or on a separate document that has been approved for use by the department. Except as otherwise provided by this section, no certificate of title may be issued by the department unless the damage disclosure statement accompanies the application. It is a Class 1 misdemeanor to intentionally falsify any information on the damage disclosure statement. No person or dealer is liable to a subsequent owner of a vehicle because a prior owner of the vehicle failed to disclose that the vehicle had previously been damaged and repaired. This section does not apply to any motor vehicle more than six model years old or with a gross vehicle weight rating of more than sixteen thousand pounds and does not apply if a rebuilt title or junking certificate is sought. This section applies to all other motor vehicles, but only damage in excess of five thousand dollars shall be disclosed in the statement. If the motor vehicle has incurred damages more than once, only those damages that occurred at one time are considered in determining whether the damages exceeded five thousand dollars. Section 4. That \u00a7 32-3-51.9 be repealed. 32-3-51.9. For the purposes of the damage disclosure statement provided by \u00a7 32-3-51.8, the term, damage, is damage to the motor vehicle caused by fire, vandalism, collision, weather, submersion in water, or flood, and does not include normal wear and tear, glass damage, mechanical repairs, or electrical repairs that have not been caused by fire, vandalism, collision, weather, submersion in water, or flood.

The department may also approve separate documents on which a damage disclosure statement may be submitted. The damage disclosure statement form shall indicate whether the motor vehicle has been damaged such that it cost more than five thousand dollars to repair to its predamaged condition and any other damage information the department deems appropriate. If a separate document from the certificate of title contains the damage disclosure statement, the document shall also require the following information: year, make, model, and vehicle identification number of the motor vehicle.

Such costs include parts, labor, paint, and frame work done on the damaged motor vehicle. If the retail value of labor has not been determined by a purchase in the ordinary course of business (for example, the labor is performed by the owner of the vehicle), the retail value of the labor is presumed to be the product of the repair time, as provided in a generally accepted autobody repair flat rate manual, multiplied by thirty-five dollars. Section 8. That \u00a7 32-3-51.18 be amended to read as follows: 32-3-51.18.

That \u00a7 32-3-51.21 be amended to read as follows: 32-3-51.21.

The insurer or self insurer shall, in writing, notify the owner of the obligation to obtain a salvage title before the owner sells or transfers the title. If the owner sells or transfers the ownership of the vehicle without first obtaining a salvage title, the owner is guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor. This section does not apply to any motor vehicle more than six ten model years old or with a gross vehicle weight rating of more than sixteen thousand pounds. Section 11. That \u00a7 32-3-51.22 be amended to read as follows: 32-3-51.22.
