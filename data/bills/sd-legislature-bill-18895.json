Local telecommunications traffic also includes any wireless to wireline telecommunications traffic that originates and terminates in the same major trading area as defined in 47 CFR \u00a7 24.202(a) as of January 1, 2004; (3) \"Nonlocal telecommunications traffic,\" any wireline to wireline telecommunications traffic that originates in one wireline local calling area and terminates in another wireline local calling area and wireline to wireless telecommunications traffic that originates in one wireline local calling area and is delivered to an actual point of presence established by a wireless service provider in another wireline local calling area. Nonlocal telecommunications traffic also includes any wireless to wireline telecommunications traffic that originates in one major trading area and terminates in another major trading area; (4) \"Originating carrier,\" a telecommunications carrier whose network or service is used by a customer to originate telecommunications traffic. An originating carrier may be a wireline or wireless carrier transmitting local telecommunications traffic or an interexchange carrier transmitting nonlocal telecommunications traffic; (5) \"Terminating carrier,\" a telecommunications carrier upon whose network telecommunications traffic terminates; (6) \"Transiting carrier,\" a telecommunications carrier that does not originate or terminate telecommunications traffic, but rather transports traffic between an originating carrier and a terminating carrier; (7) \"Transit traffic,\" telecommunications traffic that an originating carrier has delivered to a transiting carrier or carriers for delivery to a terminating carrier.

That chapter 49-31 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: If necessary for the assessment of transport and termination charges pursuant to 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 \u00a7 251(b)(5) and 252(d)(2) as of January 1, 2004, an originating carrier of local telecommunications traffic shall, in delivering its traffic, transmit signaling information in accordance with commonly accepted industry standards giving the terminating carrier information that is sufficient to identify, measure, and appropriately charge the originating carrier for services provided in terminating the local telecommunications traffic. If the originating carrier is delivering both local and nonlocal telecommunications traffic, the originating carrier shall separately provide the terminating carrier with accurate and verifiable information, including percentage measurements that enables the terminating carrier to appropriately classify telecommunications traffic as being either local or nonlocal, and interstate or intrastate, and to assess the appropriate applicable transport and termination or access charges. If accurate and verifiable information allowing appropriate classification of the terminated traffic is not provided by the originating carrier, the terminating carrier may classify all traffic terminated for the originating carrier as nonlocal telecommunications traffic for service billing purposes.

If any transiting carrier fails to deliver telecommunications traffic to another transiting carrier or to the terminating carrier with all of the signaling information transmitted by the originating carrier as required by sections 2 and 3 of this Act, and this results in telecommunications traffic that is not identifiable and therefore not billable by the terminating carrier to the appropriate originating carrier, the transiting carrier is liable to the terminating carrier for the transport and termination or access compensation relating to the traffic that cannot be identified and billed to the appropriate originating carrier. Section 5. That chapter 49-31 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Upon the request of a terminating carrier, the transiting carrier shall provide detailed transit traffic records or billing records related to the telecommunications traffic delivered to the terminating carrier.
