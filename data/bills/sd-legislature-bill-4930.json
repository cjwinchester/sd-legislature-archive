BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. For purposes of this Act, the term, qualified wind energy conversion facility, means a wind energy conversion system in this state that: (1) Produces two megawatts or less of electricity as measured by nameplate rating, and is: (a) Owned by a resident of South Dakota or an entity that is organized under the laws of this state, is not prohibited from owning agricultural land, and owns the land where the facility is sited; (b) Owned by a South Dakota small business that employs no more than twenty-five people; (c) Owned by a South Dakota nonprofit organization; (d) Owned by a tribal council if the facility is located within the boundaries of the reservation; (e) Owned by a South Dakota municipal utility or a South Dakota rural electric cooperative; (f) Owned by a South Dakota county, municipality, school district, or any other political subdivision of the state; or (g) Owned at least fifty-one percent by one or more of any combination of the entities listed in this subdivision. (2) Produces seven megawatts or less of electricity as measured by nameplate rating, and: (a) Is owned by a cooperative other than a rural electric cooperative; and (b) All shares and membership in the cooperative are held by an entity that is not prohibited from owning agricultural land. Section 2. The wind energy incentive payment program is hereby established for qualified wind energy conversion facilities. The program shall be administered by the Public Utilities Commission. Incentive payments shall be made according to this Act to the owner or operator of a qualified wind energy conversion facility for electric energy generated and sold by the facility or energy generated by the facility and consumed by the owner or operator. Any incentive payment shall be based on the number of kilowatt hours of electricity generated. The amount of the incentive payment is one cent per kilowatt hour. Payment may only be made upon receipt by the commission of an incentive payment application that establishes that the applicant is eligible to receive an incentive payment and that satisfies other requirements the commission deems necessary. The application shall be in a form and submitted at a time the commission establishes in rules pursuant to section 11 of this Act. The owner or operator of any facility that receives an incentive payment shall provide reasonable access to the facility to the public schools for education purposes. Section 3. A facility may receive payments under this Act for a five-year period. No payment under this Act may be made for electricity generated by a qualified wind energy conversion facility after December 31, 2015. The payment period begins and runs consecutively from the date the facility begins generating electricity. A subsequent owner of a qualified facility may continue to receive the incentive payment for the duration of the original payment period if the subsequent owner qualifies for the incentive under this Act. Section 4. The total size of a wind energy conversion system under this Act shall be determined according to this section. Unless the systems are interconnected with different distribution systems, the nameplate capacity of one wind energy conversion system shall be combined with the nameplate capacity of any other wind energy conversion system that is: (1) Located within five miles of the wind energy conversion system; (2) Constructed within the same calendar year as the wind energy conversion system; and (3) Under common ownership. In the case of a dispute, the Public Utilities Commission shall determine the total size of the system and shall draw all reasonable inferences in favor of combining the systems. In making a determination under this section, the commission may determine that two wind energy conversion systems are under common ownership if the underlying ownership structure contains similar persons or entities, even if the ownership shares differ between the two systems. Wind energy conversion systems are not under common ownership solely because the same person or entity provided equity financing for the systems. Section 5. The Public Utilities Commission shall authorize renewable energy production incentive payments to wind energy conversion systems not to exceed a total of forty megawatts of nameplate capacity per year. Payment of the incentive shall be made from the renewable energy development fund established pursuant to section 12 of this Act. Section 6. Nothing in this Act denies any incentive payment to an otherwise qualified facility that has obtained debt or equity financing for construction or operation if the ownership requirements of section 1 of this Act are met. If, during the incentive payment period for a qualified facility, the owner of the facility is in default of a lending agreement and the lender takes possession of and operates the facility and makes reasonable efforts to transfer ownership of the facility to an entity other than the lender, the lender may continue to receive the incentive payment for electricity generated and sold by the facility for a period not to exceed eighteen months. A lender who takes possession of a facility shall notify the Public Utilities Commission immediately on taking possession and, at least quarterly, document efforts to transfer ownership of the facility. Section 7. If, during the incentive payment period, a qualified facility loses the right to receive the incentive because of changes in ownership, the facility may regain the right to receive the incentive upon cure of the ownership structure that resulted in the loss of eligibility and may reapply for the incentive, but in no case may the payment period be extended beyond the original five-year limit. Section 8. A subsequent or requalifying owner under section 3 or 7 of this Act retains the facility's original priority order for incentive payments if the ownership structure requalifies within two years from the date the facility became unqualified or two years from the date a lender takes possession. Section 9. A qualifying project is eligible for the incentive on the date the Public Utilities Commission receives: (1) An application for payment of the incentive; (2) One of the following: (a) A copy of a signed power purchase agreement; (b) A copy of a binding agreement other than a power purchase agreement to sell electricity generated by the project to a third person; (c) If the project developer or owner will sell electricity to its own members or customers, a copy of the purchase order for equipment to construct the project with a delivery date and a copy of a signed receipt for a nonrefundable deposit; or (d) Documentation acceptable to the commission that specifies the amount of electricity generated by the facility and consumed by the owner or operator of the facility; and (3) Any other information the commission deems necessary to determine whether the proposed project qualifies for the incentive under this Act. Section 10. The Public Utilities Commission shall determine whether a project qualifies for the incentive and respond in writing to the applicant approving or denying the application within fifteen working days of receipt of the information required in section 9 of this Act. A project that is not operational within eighteen months of receipt of a letter of approval is no longer approved for the incentive. The commission shall notify an applicant of potential loss of approval not less than sixty days before the end of the eighteen-month period. Eligibility for a project that loses approval may be reestablished as of the date the commission receives a new completed application. Section 11. The Public Utilities Commission shall promulgate rules pursuant to chapter 1-26 to specify application, payment, and record keeping requirements, procedures, and forms for the wind energy production incentive payment program. The rules shall include qualifications and criteria for participation in the program, methods to be used in determining the amount of energy produced by a qualified wind energy conversion facility and sold or consumed by the owner or operator of the facility, and other provisions necessary for the administration of the program. Section 12. There is hereby created a special fund in the state treasury known as the renewable energy development fund. Money in the fund may only be used for the purposes provided in this Act. The fund consists of interest on investments, principal and interest on loans made from the fund, and moneys from all legal public and private sources, including legislative appropriations and federal grants. Money in the fund is continuously appropriated for the purposes of this Act. Section 13. There is hereby appropriated from the energy conservation loan special revenue fund established pursuant to \u00a7 1-33B-18 the sum of forty thousand dollars ($ 40,000 ), or so much thereof as may be necessary, to the renewable energy development fund to carry out the purposes of this Act.. Section 14. The executive director of the Public Utilities Commission shall approve vouchers and the state auditor shall draw warrants to pay expenditures authorized by this Act. Section 15. Any amounts appropriated in this Act not lawfully expended or obligated by June 30, 2009 , shall revert in accordance with \u00a7 4-8-21."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 4930, "action_date": "2008-01-16T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 1255, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/1255.pdf", "status_text": "First read in Senate and referred to", "journal_page": 136, "committee_id_action": 28, "committee_id_assigned": 10, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 4930, "action_date": "2008-01-23T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 1291, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/1291.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 10, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 4930, "action_date": "2008-01-25T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 1719, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/1719.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 10, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 4930, "action_date": "2008-01-25T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 1867, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/1867.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to the 36th legislative day", "journal_page": 214, "committee_id_action": 10, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 654, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [557, 569, 629, 588, 553], "Nay": [530, 567, 577], "Excused": [598]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/4930"}
