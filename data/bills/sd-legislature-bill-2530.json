The maximum levies may not be lowered to account for any reduction in the per student allocation for school fiscal year 2012. Section 2. That \u00a7 10-12-42 be amended to read as follows: 10-12-42.

It is the policy of the Legislature that the appropriation for the state aid to education foundation program increase on an annual basis by the percentage increase in local need on an aggregate statewide basis so that the relative proportion of local need paid by local effort and state aid shall remain constant. For school fiscal year 2012, it is the policy of the Legislature that the relative proportion of the total local need paid by state aid shall be amended by adjusting the proportion of state aid to fifty-three and eight-tenths percent of the total local need. However, the increase in the per student allocation on an annual basis that exceeds three percent shall be paid solely by the state and is not a factor in this policy. Section 2.

Any adjustments in the levies specified in \u00a7 10-12-42 made pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 13-13-71 and 13-13-72 shall be based on maintaining the relationship between statewide local effort as a percentage of statewide local need in the fiscal year succeeding the fiscal year in which the adjustment is made. However, for fiscal year 2013 and each year thereafter, if the levies specified in \u00a7 10-12-42 are not adjusted to maintain this relationship, the per student allocation as defined in \u00a7 13-13-10.1(4) shall be reduced to maintain the relationship between statewide local effort as a percentage of statewide local need. Any adjustment to the levy for agricultural property shall be based upon the change in the statewide agricultural taxable valuation and the reclassification of agricultural property to another property classification. Any adjustment to the levies for nonagricultural property and owner-occupied single-family dwellings shall be based upon the change in the statewide nonagricultural property and owner-occupied single-family dwellings taxable valuations. However, if any new project with a total taxable valuation of one hundred fifty million dollars or more is constructed, the levies shall be proportionately decreased for agricultural property, nonagricultural property, and owner-occupied single-family dwellings. In addition to the adjustments in the levies provided by this section, the levies shall also be annually adjusted as necessary to reduce the portion of local need paid by local effort by an amount equal to nine million dollars from those funds transferred into the property tax reduction fund pursuant to \u00a7 10-50-52 subsequent to July 1, 2007. In addition to the adjustments in the levies provided by this section, the levies for nonagricultural property and owner-occupied single-family dwellings shall also be adjusted as necessary to account for the additional increase in the total assessed value for nonagricultural property and owner-occupied single-family dwellings pursuant to the phasing out and repeal of the provisions provided in \u00a7 10-6-74.
