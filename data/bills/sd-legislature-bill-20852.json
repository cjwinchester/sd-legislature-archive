South Dakota's Armed Forces Reserve units include the Navy Operational Support Center in Sioux Falls and four Army Reserve units, including the 323rd Chemical Company in Sioux Falls and Vermillion; the 1041st Training Detachment-Engineer in Sioux Falls; the 2nd Bn. 361st Regiment, 94th Division in Sioux Falls; and the 452nd Ordnance Company in Aberdeen.

In addition, many South Dakotans serve in reserve units in surrounding states; and WHEREAS, South Dakota's Armed Forces Reserve members, like the South Dakota National Guard, serve in a demanding and uncertain environment that frequently separates them for long periods from their families and civilian employment and sometimes involves overseas combat deployments in support of Operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom. All of South Dakota's Armed Forces Reserve units have been called to active duty for extended periods in recent years, including the 323rd Chemical Company, which served for 14 months in Iraq, and the 453nd Ordnance Company, which is currently serving in Iraq; and WHEREAS, the experiences of Army Captain Kelly R. Smidt of Chamberlain, Justin Drey of Colton, Brandon McCoy of Montrose, Dr. Eldon Bell of Rapid City, and many others exemplify the challenges and sacrifices endured by members of the Armed Forces Reserve.

Their active duty service has entailed major sacrifices and disruptions to their personal and professional lives, a situation that is duplicated for countless members of the Armed Forces Reserve: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT COMMEMORATED, by the Eighty-first Legislature of the State of South Dakota, that the South Dakota Legislature recognizes and honors the dedicated service of South Dakota's members of the Armed Forces Reserve and expresses its earnest hope for the safe return of those Armed Forces Reserve members who are currently serving in harm's way."}, {"bill_id": 20852, "bill_version_id": 109499, "bill_version": "Enrolled", "bill_version_date": "2006-02-27T17:10:59-06:00", "bill_text": "A LEGISLATIVE COMMEMORATION, Honoring the service and contributions of South Dakota's citizens who serve in the Armed Forces Reserve.
