Section 23. The board may, in a disciplinary proceeding, order a practitioner to submit to a reasonable physical or mental examination if the practitioner's physical or mental capacity to practice safely is at issue. Failure to comply with a board order to submit to a physical or mental examination renders a practitioner liable to the summary revocation procedures described in section 25 of this Act. Section 24.

The board may withdraw the probation if the board finds the deficiencies that resulted in disciplinary action have been remedied. Certification shall remain in effect during the pendency of an appeal unless suspended under section 25 of this Act. Section 25. The board may summarily suspend a practitioner's certification in advance of a final adjudication or during the appeals process if the board finds that a practitioner would represent a clear and immediate danger to the public health and safety if the practitioner were allowed to continue to practice. A practitioner whose certification is suspended under this section is entitled to a hearing before the board within twenty days after the effective date of the suspension. The practitioner may subsequently appeal the suspension to circuit court in accordance with chapter 1-26. Section 26. Any practitioner whose certification or registration to practice has been suspended or revoked may be reinstated or a new certification or registration may be issued, as the case may be, if in the discretion of the board, such action is warranted. The board may require the applicant to pay all costs of the proceedings resulting in the applicant's suspension or revocation of certification or registration and reinstatement or new certification or registration. In addition, the board may, by rule promulgated pursuant to chapter 1-26, require a fee for reinstatement, not to exceed one hundred fifty dollars. Section 27. In the prosecution of any person for violation of this Act, it is not necessary to allege or prove lack of valid certification. Proof of certification or registration is a matter of defense to be established by the defendant. Section 28. Nothing in this Act may be construed to limit the ongoing certification of any person at the level of certification and for the time period established under the former South Dakota Chemical Dependency Counselor Certification Board."}, {"bill_id": 18713, "bill_version_id": 99484, "bill_version": "Senate Health and Human Services Engrossed", "bill_version_date": "2004-01-21T17:15:16-06:00", "bill_text": "FOR AN ACT ENTITLED, An Act to create the South Dakota Certification Board for Alcohol and Drug Professionals and to provide for its powers and duties.

Section 16.

Section 17. The board may use its own staff or employ certified chemical dependency counselors, certified prevention specialists, agents, or investigators to assist in the enforcement of this Act or any rule promulgated by the board. Any person violating the provisions of this Act may be enjoined from further violations by an action brought by the state's attorney of the county where the violations occurred or by an action brought by any citizen in the state. The attorney general, the board, or the state's attorney may apply to the circuit court for the county in which a violation of this Act is alleged to have occurred for an order enjoining or restraining the commission or continuance of the acts. The board may authorize a hearing examiner to conduct the hearing required to determine a violation of this Act. Section 18. The board may, if it deems best for the enforcement of this Act or in the conduct of its duties, employ an attorney designated by the attorney general and subject to the supervision, control, and direction of the attorney general. The board shall fix and determine the compensation and period of service of the attorney who shall be paid out of the funds of the board. Section 19. The board shall receive complaints from its members, consumers, third party carriers providing financial reimbursement for chemical dependency prevention or counseling services, or the public concerning a practitioner's professional practices. Each complaint received shall be logged by the secretary-treasurer recording the practitioner's name, name of the complaining party, date of the complaint, a brief statement of the complaint, and its ultimate disposition. The board shall investigate each alleged violation of this Act. All disciplinary proceedings held under the authority of this Act shall be conducted in accordance with chapter 1-26. Section 20. The decision of the board to suspend or revoke a certification requires a majority vote of all the board members. Section 21. If the board determines that any complaint is frivolous or clearly unfounded in fact, the board may dismiss the complaint and, by a separate and unanimous vote of the board, may expunge the complaint from the record of the certified practitioner. Section 22. Any practitioner subject to this Act shall practice in accordance with the standards established by the board and is subject to the exercise of the disciplinary sanctions enumerated in section 24 of this Act if, after a hearing in the manner provided in chapter 1-26, the board finds that: (1) A practitioner has employed or knowingly cooperated in fraud or material deception in order to obtain a certification to practice the profession, or has engaged in fraud or material deception in the course of professional services or activities; (2) A practitioner has been convicted in any court of a felony; (3) A practitioner has engaged in or permitted the performance of unacceptable patient care by the practitioner or by auxiliaries working under the practitioner's supervision due to any deliberate or negligent act or failure to act; (4) A practitioner has knowingly violated any provision of this Act or board rules; (5) A practitioner has continued to practice although the practitioner has become unfit to practice due to professional incompetence, failure to keep abreast of current professional theory or practice, physical or mental disability, or addiction or severe dependency upon or use of alcohol or other drugs which endanger the public by impairing a practitioner's ability to practice safely; (6) A practitioner has engaged in lewd or immoral conduct in connection with the delivery of chemical dependency or prevention services to consumers; (7) A practitioner has or is employing or assisting an uncertified person to hold himself or herself out as a certified chemical dependency counselor or certified prevention specialist; or (8) A practitioner has engaged in false or misleading advertising. No suspension or revocation may be based on a judgment as to therapeutic value of any individual treatment rendered, but only upon a repeated pattern or trend of treatment resulting in unacceptable results. Section 23. The board may, in a disciplinary proceeding, order a practitioner to submit to a reasonable physical or mental examination if the practitioner's physical or mental capacity to practice safely is at issue. Failure to comply with a board order to submit to a physical or mental examination renders a practitioner liable to the summary revocation procedures described in section 25 of this Act. Section 24. The board may impose any of the following sanctions, singly or in combination, if the board finds that a practitioner has violated any part of section 22 of this Act: (1) Revoke a practitioner's certification to practice for an indefinite length of time; (2) Suspend a practitioner's certification for a specific or indefinite length of time; (3) Censure a practitioner; (4) Issue a letter of reprimand; (5) Place a practitioner on probationary status and require the practitioner to report regularly to the board on the matters which are the basis for probation; (6) Limit the practitioner's practice to areas prescribed by the board and continue to renew professional education until a satisfactory degree of skill has been attained in those areas which are the basis of the probation; (7) Require the practitioner to reimburse the board in an amount equal to the costs incurred for the investigation and disciplinary hearing. The board may withdraw the probation if the board finds the deficiencies that resulted in disciplinary action have been remedied. Certification shall remain in effect during the pendency of an appeal unless suspended under section 25 of this Act. Section 25. The board may summarily suspend a practitioner's certification in advance of a final adjudication or during the appeals process if the board finds that a practitioner would represent a clear and immediate danger to the public health and safety if the practitioner were allowed to continue to practice. A practitioner whose certification is suspended under this section is entitled to a hearing before the board within twenty days after the effective date of the suspension. The practitioner may subsequently appeal the suspension to circuit court in accordance with chapter 1-26. Section 26. Any practitioner whose certification or registration to practice has been suspended or revoked may be reinstated or a new certification or registration may be issued, as the case may be, if in the discretion of the board, such action is warranted. The board may require the applicant to pay all costs of the proceedings resulting in the applicant's suspension or revocation of certification or registration and reinstatement or new certification or registration. In addition, the board may, by rule promulgated pursuant to chapter 1-26, require a fee for reinstatement, not to exceed one hundred fifty dollars. Section 27. In the prosecution of any person for violation of this Act, it is not necessary to allege or prove lack of valid certification. Proof of certification or registration is a matter of defense to be established by the defendant. Section 28. Nothing in this Act may be construed to limit the ongoing certification of any person at the level of certification and for the time period established under the former South Dakota Chemical Dependency Counselor Certification Board doing business as the Certification Board for Alcohol and Drug Professionals Section 29.
