WHEREAS, Congress passed the Wilderness Act of 1964 \"to establish a National Wilderness Preservation System for the permanent good of the whole people, and for other purposes\"; and WHEREAS, under the Wilderness Act of 1964 and subsequent federal legislation, many areas across the nation have been designated as \"wilderness areas\" or \"roadless areas\"; and WHEREAS, the effect of the designation of wilderness areas in many cases is to hinder or preclude the ability of South Dakota citizens to develop and use the natural resources of this state in a fair and equitable manner; and WHEREAS, many of our rural economies depend on a combination of multiple uses of our public lands, such as agriculture, grazing, timber production, and mineral development, as well as motorized and mechanized recreation, all of which may be prohibited or seriously inhibited by a wilderness management; and WHEREAS, wilderness management designations may limit the land management options available to public land managers to protect forest health and dependent watersheds and other public lands; and WHEREAS, land and resource conservation decisions must consider the relationship between the land and the local economy, because many jobs are tied to activities on public lands such as mining, agriculture, and tourism; and WHEREAS, programs for the designation of wilderness areas in South Dakota must be based upon the principles of balance, stewardship, and collaboration of all affected parties; and WHEREAS, the South Dakota Legislature finds that a regional strategy involving all affected parties is the preferred approach to the management for wilderness areas: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the Senate of the Ninety-Third Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the House of Representatives concurring therein, that the South Dakota Legislature requests the United States Department of the Interior, the United States Department of Agriculture, the Bureau of Land Management, the United States Forest Service, and other federal natural resource and land management agencies to structure their policies so that no area in South Dakota may be designated or managed as a wilderness unless the designation has been approved by a two-thirds majority in each house of the South Dakota Legislature; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the United States Congress enact legislation to release all wilderness study and management areas in order to secure the rights of South Dakota citizens to use these public lands for public purposes, including for purposes of multiple recreation use, unless Congress confirms a study area for inclusion in the National Wilderness Preservation System."}, {"bill_id": 9150, "bill_version_id": 49859, "bill_version": "Enrolled", "bill_version_date": "2018-02-26T11:05:39.437-06:00", "bill_text": ""}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 9150, "action_date": "2018-01-31T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 48333, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/48333.pdf", "status_text": "First Reading", "journal_page": 288, "committee_id_action": 395, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 9150, "action_date": "2018-02-01T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 48504, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/48504.pdf", "status_text": "Adopt Resolution", "journal_page": 317, "committee_id_action": 395, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 25182, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [1239, 1230, 1264, 1231, 1217, 1246, 1219, 1273, 1234, 1278, 1304, 1270, 1224, 1267, 1243, 1218, 1244, 1281, 1221, 1272, 1233, 1245, 1271, 1252, 1237, 1288, 1220, 1242, 1276, 1300], "Nay": [1228, 1262, 1290, 1232, 1289]}}, {"bill_id": 9150, "action_date": "2018-02-02T13:30:00-06:00", "document_id": 48610, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/48610.pdf", "status_text": "First read and referred to", "journal_page": 313, "committee_id_action": 396, "committee_id_assigned": 397, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 9150, "action_date": "2018-02-22T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 49576, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/49576.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 397, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 9150, "action_date": "2018-02-22T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 49631, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/49631.pdf", "status_text": "Adopt Resolution", "journal_page": 545, "committee_id_action": 397, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 26171, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [1268], "Yea": [1307, 1308, 1291, 1306, 1293, 1310, 1280, 1309, 1225, 1241, 1249], "Excused": [1214]}}, {"bill_id": 9150, "action_date": "2018-02-23T13:30:00-06:00", "document_id": 49812, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/49812.pdf", "status_text": "Concurred in Resolution", "journal_page": 573, "committee_id_action": 396, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 26317, "president_vote": null, "Excused": [1313, 1284, 1223, 1260, 1296, 1249, 1261, 1305, 1254], "Yea": [1241, 1269, 1297, 1424, 1279, 1214, 1266, 1307, 1301, 1235, 1294, 1425, 1282, 1311, 1308, 1312, 1291, 1275, 1283, 1250, 1286, 1314, 1222, 1302, 1306, 1265, 1315, 1247, 1316, 1292, 1248, 1293, 1310, 1226, 1280, 1263, 1295, 1277, 1303, 1309, 1259, 1255, 1299, 1225, 1258, 1287, 1236, 1215, 1317, 1216, 1298, 1285, 1253], "Nay": [1213, 1268, 1238, 1274, 1256, 1240, 1257, 1229]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/9150"}
