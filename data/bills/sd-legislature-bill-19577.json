BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. Terms used in this Act mean: (1) \"Employee,\" any person who is employed by, or has a conditional offer of employment with, an employer; (2) \"Employer,\" any adjustment training center; (3) \"Workplace,\" the offices, residential homes, facilities, and surrounding areas on property owned and leased by an employer, property rented or owned by the clients served by the employer, parking lots, and storage areas. The term also includes any vehicle or equipment owned or leased by the employer, wherever located. The employee's personal vehicle is also considered a workplace if being used while on the job. Section 2. No employee may use, possess, sell, trade, offer for sale, or offer to buy illegal drugs or engage in the illegal use of legal drugs or alcohol at the workplace. No employee may report to work while possessing illegal drugs or alcohol or having any detectable amount in his or her body. No employee may report to work while possessing legal drugs that are illegally used or having any detectable amount in his or her body. An employee who violates this section is subject to disciplinary action, which may include termination of employment. Nothing in this section alters or waives the at-will employment relationship. Section 3. An employee shall sign a consent form for alcohol and drug testing. Failure to sign the consent form shall result in termination of employment. Any person with a contingent offer of employment from an employer shall sign the consent form or the offer of employment shall be withdrawn. Section 4. An employee shall immediately report suspected violations of this Act to an immediate supervisor, a member of the administration, or a member of the human resource department. Section 5. An employee shall notify the employee's employer in writing of any conviction of a violation of a criminal drug statute occurring in the workplace no later than five calendar days after such conviction. The employer shall notify any contracting party within ten days of receiving such notification. Section 6. Any employee who is arrested for drug activity shall notify the employee's supervisor or department head within twenty-four hours of such arrest. The employer may require the employee to submit to drug testing or suspend employment in the event of such an arrest. Section 7. An employee convicted of drug use or possession, or the sale or distribution of drugs, shall notify the supervisor or department head within twenty-four hours of the conviction. An employer shall terminate the employment of any employee convicted of any crime listed in this section. Section 8. An employer shall conduct the following types of drug and alcohol tests on each employee, as applicable: (1) Drug and alcohol tests after a conditional offer of employment. Upon a conditional offer, the new employee shall be tested. The new employee may not start employment until the employer has received confirmation of negative test results. The offer of employment shall be withdrawn if the new employee fails to report for testing or has a positive confirmed drug test; (2) Reasonable suspicion drug and alcohol testing. An employer shall require an employee to submit to reasonable suspicion drug or alcohol testing. A written record shall be made of the observations leading up to reasonable suspicion test within twenty-four hours of the observed behavior or before the results of the test are released, whichever is earlier. A copy of the documentation shall be given to the employee upon request, and the original documentation shall be kept confidential by the employer. The employer shall retain the documentation for one year; and (3) Random drug and alcohol testing. An employer shall conduct random tests on no less than ten percent of its employees each year. Each employee shall be in a pool from which random selections are made. Each employee shall have an equal chance of selection and shall remain in the pool even after the employee has been tested. The random selection shall be made using a scientifically valid random generation process. Section 9. Any specimen collection and testing for drugs and alcohol pursuant to this Act shall be performed in accordance with the procedures provided for by the United States Department of Transportation rules for workplace drug and alcohol testing compiled in 49 C.F.R., Part 40. Section 10. Any initial positive test result shall be confirmed by another test, using the original specimen. If a second test is positive, the results shall be reviewed to determine any possible alternative explanation for the positive result. If no other explanation exists, the test shall be considered verified. The employer shall terminate the employment of the employee with the positive confirmed result. Section 11. Any employee who believes that a positive test result was caused by a medication prescribed by a licenced health care professional may give consent to contact the licensed health care professional for purposes of verifying the use of the prescribed medication and its use for a current condition. If an employee fails to give such consent, the employee's belief shall be considered as unsubstantiated. Section 12. Any employee refusing to submit to a drug or alcohol test shall be terminated from employment. An employee has refused testing if the employee: (1) Refuses to sign a drug and alcohol testing consent form; (2) Refuses to be drug tested; (3) Fails to report within the required time period for testing; (4) Gives false information, an altered or substituted specimen, or a specimen that is not within the temperature range required for testing; or (5) Is unable to produce urine, after consumption of forty ounces of fluid and three hours are allowed, with an absence of a valid medical explanation. Section 13. The employer shall pay for the costs of any tests, both initial tests and tests for verification, that the employer requires of the employee. Section 14. An employer shall provide to each employee a written policy statement that contains the contents of this Act and any procedures used by the employer in implementing this Act."}, {"bill_id": 19577, "bill_version_id": 103912, "bill_version": "House Health and Human Services Engrossed", "bill_version_date": "2005-02-02T13:54:56-06:00", "bill_text": "FOR AN ACT ENTITLED, An Act to provide for a drug screening program for certain facilities providing patient or resident care or supervision.
