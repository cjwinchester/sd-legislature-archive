BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 32-27-1 be amended to read as follows: 32-27-1. The driver of any vehicle upon a highway within a business or residence district shall yield the right-of-way to shall bring the vehicle to a complete stop for a pedestrian crossing the highway entering or within any clearly marked crosswalk or any regular pedestrian crossing included in the prolongation of the lateral boundary lines of the adjacent sidewalk at the end of a block, except at intersections where the movement of traffic is being regulated by traffic officers or traffic direction devices until the pedestrian has completed crossing. If there is a divided highway with a median, the driver may proceed once the pedestrian has proceeded through the driver's lane and has reached the median. If any vehicle is stopped at a crosswalk, or other pedestrian crossing to permit a pedestrian to cross, the driver of any other vehicle approaching from the rear shall also stop until the pedestrian has completed crossing. However, no pedestrian may suddenly leave a curb or other place of safety and walk or run into the path of a vehicle which is so close as to constitute an immediate hazard. A violation of this section by a driver is a petty offense Class 2 misdemeanor. This section does not apply if the movement of traffic is being regulated by a traffic officer or traffic direction device."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 6416, "action_date": "2015-01-13T12:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 33112, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/33112.pdf", "status_text": "First Reading House", "journal_page": 28, "committee_id_action": 286, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 6416, "action_date": "2015-01-14T13:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 33159, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/33159.pdf", "status_text": "Referred to", "journal_page": 38, "committee_id_action": 286, "committee_id_assigned": 281, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 6416, "action_date": "2015-01-22T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 33271, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/33271.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 281, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 6416, "action_date": "2015-01-22T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 33474, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/33474.pdf", "status_text": "Tabled", "journal_page": 79, "committee_id_action": 281, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 17637, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [884, 946, 857, 921], "Yea": [859, 905, 911, 864, 865, 933, 867, 950, 918]}}, {"bill_id": 6416, "action_date": "2015-01-27T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 33830, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/33830.pdf", "status_text": "Removed from table", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 281, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 18177, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [884, 859, 946, 865, 918, 857, 921], "Nay": [905, 911, 864, 933, 950], "Excused": [867]}}, {"bill_id": 6416, "action_date": "2015-02-10T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 34534, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/34534.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 281, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 6416, "action_date": "2015-02-10T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 34796, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/34796.pdf", "status_text": "Tabled", "journal_page": 360, "committee_id_action": 281, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 18464, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [884, 859, 946, 905, 911, 864, 865, 933, 867, 950, 918, 857], "Excused": [921]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/6416"}
