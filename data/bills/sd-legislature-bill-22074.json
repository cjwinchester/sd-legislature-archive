Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of South Dakota: Section 1. That a NEW SECTION be added: 12-20-39.1. Municipal elections--Ranked-choice voting. A municipality may adopt ordinances that provide for a ranked-choice voting process for electing officers under the municipality's jurisdiction. If a municipality adopts an ordinance under this section, a person may only be deemed elected with the most votes under \u00a7 12-20-39 after the ranked-choice voting process has been completed. For the purpose of this section, ranked-choice voting process means an electoral system in which voters rank candidates by preference on their ballots. If any candidate receives a majority of the vote, that candidate wins. If not, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated, with the votes going to that candidate being redistributed to the next choice indicated on those voters' ballots. The process is repeated, having the candidate with the fewest votes after redistribution be eliminated, until a candidate receives an outright majority."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 22074, "action_date": "2021-01-22T13:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 212442, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/212442.pdf", "status_text": "First read in Senate and referred to", "journal_page": 95, "committee_id_action": 514, "committee_id_assigned": 511, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 22074, "action_date": "2021-01-27T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 212645, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/212645.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 511, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 22074, "action_date": "2021-01-27T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 213191, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/213191.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 511, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "D", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 22074, "action_date": "2021-01-27T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 213191, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/213191.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to the 41st legislative day", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 511, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 67937, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [1771, 1775, 1783, 1790, 1811, 1831], "Nay": [1789]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/22074"}
