BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 13-26-2 be amended to read as follows: 13-26-2. The school board or governing body shall operate grades one through twelve in its schools for at least a nine-month regular term in any one school year. The regular school term shall be for a term as specified in section 2 of this Act and may be conducted on a year-round basis, but for grades one through twelve shall consist of school actually in session for at least one hundred seventy-five days and shall begin on a date established by the school board. The State Board of Education shall promulgate rules pursuant to chapter 1-26 governing the operation and scheduling of year-round schools. The rules may allow deviations from the one hundred seventy-five day requirement in this section 2 of this Act and from the five and one-half hour per day requirement in \u00a7 13-26-1 if the total school term hours requirement in \u00a7 13-26-2.1 is met. The local school board or governing body may establish the school term for kindergarten programs. Any school board or governing body may release graduating high school seniors from school before the end of the regular term if the release is for no more than three days. Make up days for school closing because of weather, disease or emergency need not exceed ten days. Graduating seniors are excused from make up days if the make up days occur after the students have graduated or after graduation exercises have been held. If classes have been convened and then are dismissed because of inclement weather, that day constitutes a day in session. School boards are encouraged to provide days within the regular school term for curriculum and staff development which shall be in addition to the one hundred seventy-five days required in this section requirement in section 2 of this Act . Each school board shall determine the appropriate number of days for this activity and how best to use the time based on local needs for program development, increased parent participation, student contact, teachers' preparation, or other needs of the schools in the district. School shall be in session only when classes are held and as provided in \u00a7 \u00a7 13-26-4 and 13-26-4.1. A school board may operate a special term during the summer months. Section 2.
