Section 2. That chapter 62-8 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: For purposes of this Act, any occupational exposure occurring on or after July 1, 2004, shall be deemed documented if the person covered under this Act gave notice, written or otherwise, of the occupational exposure to the person's employer.

For purposes of potential transmission of hepatitis, meningococcal meningitis, tuberculosis, or HIV, the term, blood or body fluids, includes respiratory, salivary, and sinus fluids, including droplets, sputum, saliva, mucous, and any other fluid through which infectious airborne or blood-borne organisms can be transmitted between persons. Section 4.

Section 7. That chapter 62-8 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Any person covered under the provisions of this Act who tests positive for exposure to an enumerated occupational disease, but has not yet incurred the requisite total or partial disability, is entitled to make a claim for medical benefits pursuant to this chapter, including entitlement to an annual medical examination to measure the progress of the condition, if any, and any other medical treatment, prophylactic, or otherwise. Section 8. That chapter 62-8 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: If any standard, medically-recognized vaccine or other form of immunization or prophylaxis exists for the prevention of a communicable disease for which a presumption is established under this Act and if medically indicated by the given circumstances pursuant to immunization policies established by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the United States Public Health Service, any person subject to the provisions of this Act may be required by the person's employer to undergo the immunization or prophylaxis unless the person's physician determines in writing that the immunization or prophylaxis would pose a significant risk to the person's health. Section 9. That chapter 62-8 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: The presumptions provided for in section 1 of this Act only apply if the person entitled to invoke the presumption has, if requested by the person's employer, undergone a preemployment physical examination that: (1) Was conducted prior to the making of any claim under this title that relies on such presumptions; (2) Was performed by a physician whose qualifications are as prescribed by the employer; (3) Included such appropriate laboratory and other diagnostic studies as the employer may have prescribed; and (4) Found the person free of hepatitis, meningococcal meningitis, tuberculosis, or HIV at the time of the examination."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 18422, "action_date": "2004-01-23T12:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 99770, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/99770.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 184, "committee_id_action": 831, "committee_id_assigned": 829, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 18422, "action_date": "2004-02-06T07:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 100777, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/100777.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 829, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 18422, "action_date": "2004-02-06T07:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 100777, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/100777.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass Amended,", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 829, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "F", "vote": {"vote_id": 57090, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [3057, 3060, 3075, 3080, 3084, 3106, 3114, 3119, 3133, 3107], "Yea": [3070, 3125], "Excused": [3111]}}, {"bill_id": 18422, "action_date": "2004-02-06T07:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 100777, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/100777.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass Amended,", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 829, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "F", "vote": {"vote_id": 57090, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [3057, 3060, 3075, 3080, 3084, 3106, 3114, 3119, 3133, 3107], "Yea": [3070, 3125], "Excused": [3111]}}, {"bill_id": 18422, "action_date": "2004-02-06T07:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 100777, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/100777.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to 36th legislative day", "journal_page": 431, "committee_id_action": 829, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 57091, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [3057, 3060, 3075, 3080, 3084, 3106, 3114, 3119, 3133, 3107], "Nay": [3070, 3125], "Excused": [3111]}}]}
