BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. The Public Utilities Commission, by rules promulgate pursuant to chapter 1-26, may establish or participate in a program to track, record, and verify electricity generated from renewable sources and recycled heat sources. The program shall track, record, and verify the trading of credits for electricity generated from renewable sources and recycled heat sources among electric generators, utilities, and other interested entities within this state and with similar entities in other states. This section applies to all public utilities, electric cooperatives, and municipal electric utilities. For purposes of qualifying for credits for electricity generated from renewable and recycled energy sources, electricity must be generated from a source identified in section 2 of this Act. Section 2. As used in section 1 of this Act, renewable sources and recycled heat sources include the following sources for producing energy: (1) Solar, using the sun as the source of energy for producing electricity; (2) Wind, using the wind as the source of energy for producing electricity; (3) Biomass, using agricultural crops and agricultural wastes and residues, wood and wood wastes and residues, animal wastes, and landfill gas as the fuel to produce electricity; (4) Hydroelectric, using water as the source of energy to produce electricity; (5) Geothermal, using energy contained in heat that continuously flows outward from the earth as the source of energy to produce electricity; (6) Hydrogen, provided that the hydrogen is generated from a source listed in this section; and (7) Recycled energy systems producing electricity from currently unused waste heat resulting from combustion or other processes into electricity and which do not use an additional combustion process. The term does not include any system whose primary purpose is the generation of electricity."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 19813, "action_date": "2005-01-26T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 103314, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/103314.pdf", "status_text": "First read in Senate and referred to", "journal_page": 188, "committee_id_action": 861, "committee_id_assigned": 843, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 19813, "action_date": "2005-02-09T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 104391, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/104391.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 843, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 19813, "action_date": "2005-02-09T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 104391, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/104391.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to 41st legislative day", "journal_page": 401, "committee_id_action": 843, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 59764, "president_vote": null, "Excused": [3150, 3217], "Yea": [3212, 3214, 3224, 3236, 3241, 3205, 3154]}}]}
