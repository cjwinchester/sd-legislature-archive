Sediment from these tributaries creates deltas in the river channel, causing damage under certain conditions: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the Senate of the Seventy-seventh Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the House of Representatives concurring therein, that the United States Congress and the appropriate federal agencies are urged to address and solve the urgent problems created by sedimentation in the Missouri River Main Stem Reservoir System. 350 copies of this document were printed by the South Dakota Legislative Research Council at a cost of $.027 per page. .
