Section 17. That chapter 10-50 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Any cigarettes that have been sold, offered for sale, or possessed for sale in violation of this Act are contraband goods and may be legally seized, without a warrant, by the secretary, the secretary's agents or employees, or by any law enforcement officer of this state if directed by the secretary to do so. Any cigarettes seized and forfeited under this section shall be destroyed. Section 18. That chapter 10-50 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: The secretary, for purposes of this Act, may promulgate rules pursuant to chapter 1-26 concerning the procedures, forms, and contents for: (1) The certification process for tobacco product manufacturers; (2) The reporting requirements for distributors and wholesalers; and (3) The directory of tobacco product manufacturers that have complied with the requirements of this Act. Section 19. That chapter 10-50 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: The attorney general may seek an injunction to restrain a threatened or actual violation of this Act.

Section 23. That \u00a7 10-50-69 be repealed. 10-50-69. The secretary of revenue shall annually, no later than May fifteenth, transmit to all licensed distributors and wholesalers, and post on the Department of Revenue's website, a directory of nonparticipating tobacco product manufacturers determined by the secretary to be in compliance with subdivision 10-50B-7(2).

The secretary of revenue may require distributors, wholesalers, and nonparticipating tobacco product manufacturers to submit such information as the secretary may determine is necessary to enable the secretary to determine whether a nonparticipating tobacco product manufacturer is in compliance with subdivision 10-50B-7(2). Section 24. That \u00a7 10-50-70 be repealed. 10-50-70.
