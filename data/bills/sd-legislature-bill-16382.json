WHEREAS, Terminator gene technology, the genetic engineering process that renders a seed incapable of naturally producing second generation seed, threatens the ability of nations to feed themselves as over 1.4 billion people depend on farm-saved seeds developed over hundreds of years to meet the climatic and soil variables for their particular country; and WHEREAS, the publicly-funded United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), through contractual arrangements with private corporate entities, has helped develop and promote this dangerous technology that has no agronomic benefits and solely enhances seed industry profits; and WHEREAS, the USDA's role in the commercialization of Terminator technology is a threat to our environment, biodiversity, and food security and is morally unacceptable; and WHEREAS, this technology promotes global consolidation and control through the restricted ownership by a few giant seed and germ plasm companies thus endangering independent farming operations and food security worldwide: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the House of Representatives of the Seventy- sixth Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the Senate concurring therein, that the South Dakota Legislature urges the United States Congress to enact legislation prohibiting the sale, distribution, or use of nongerminating genetically engineered seed rendered incapable of producing second generation seed by terminator gene technology, and authorizing the Secretary of Agriculture to impose a civil penalty for violating the prohibition on the sale, distribution, or use of nongerminating genetically engineered seed."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 16382, "action_date": "2001-02-12T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 89839, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/89839.pdf", "status_text": "Adopt Resolution", "journal_page": 447, "committee_id_action": 712, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "F", "vote": {"vote_id": 51497, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [2514, 2515, 2522, 2526, 2528, 2533, 2537, 2538, 2544, 2546, 2553, 2556, 2557, 2558, 2559, 2561, 2563, 2564, 2565, 2570, 2571, 2575, 2577, 2578, 2579, 2582, 2583, 2588, 2592, 2593, 2595, 2596, 2599, 2600, 2601, 2603, 2604, 2605, 2608, 2610, 2612, 2613, 2618, 2540], "Yea": [2518, 2519, 2521, 2525, 2527, 2530, 2541, 2543, 2545, 2548, 2554, 2555, 2560, 2566, 2568, 2572, 2574, 2586, 2587, 2589, 2591, 2594, 2602, 2611, 2614], "Excused": [2547]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/16382"}
