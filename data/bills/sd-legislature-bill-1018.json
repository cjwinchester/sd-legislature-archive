BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. Any electric customer who has an interconnection agreement with an electric utility for a customer-owned wind generation facility or has a customer-owned wind generation facility connected to the utility's system may submit a request to the utility and the utility shall transport that electricity to any customer owned or controlled property that is within ten miles of the wind generation facility. If the customer's interconnection agreement is with another electric utility that serves a customer-owned wind generation facility within the ten-mile limit, the customer's electric utility shall make an arrangement on the customer's behalf with the utility serving the generation site to have the power transported to the customer's serving electric utility. This section only applies to a customer-owned wind generation facility that has a nameplate rating of one hundred kilowatts or less. The maximum the utility may charge for transporting the electricity for the customer shall be one-tenth of one cent per kilowatt hour unless the utility determines this charge is insufficient. The utility may choose to perform a cost study which shall be filed with the Public Utilities Commission for review and approval or disapproval subject to chapter 49-34A. The Public Utilities Commission has three months from the date of filing to issue a final decision."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 1018, "action_date": "2009-02-03T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 6759, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/6759.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 269, "committee_id_action": 56, "committee_id_assigned": 49, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 1018, "action_date": "2009-02-20T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 7497, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/7497.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 49, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 1018, "action_date": "2009-02-20T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 7908, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/7908.pdf", "status_text": "Motion to amend", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 49, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 1018, "action_date": "2009-02-20T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 7908, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/7908.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to the 41st legislative day", "journal_page": 460, "committee_id_action": 49, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 4423, "president_vote": null, "Excused": [666, 721, 695], "Yea": [651, 660, 693, 683, 639, 681, 657, 691, 643], "Nay": [645]}}]}
