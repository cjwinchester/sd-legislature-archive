The amount of bail, if any, shall be fixed by the court and endorsed on the warrant. Section 4. That \u00a7 23A-6-28 be amended to read as follows: 23A-6-28. A summons shall be in the same form as a warrant except that it shall summon the defendant to appear before a circuit court judge or magistrate judge, as the case may be, at a stated time and place. The time stated shall may not be more than ten days from the date the indictment was presented to the court. The summons shall be signed by a circuit the judge. Section 5.
