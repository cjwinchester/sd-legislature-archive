BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That chapter 2-6 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Terms used in this Act mean: (1) \"Committee,\" the Government Operations and Audit Committee; (2) \"Incentive,\" a state program, statutory provision, or tax expenditure, including tax credits, tax exemptions, tax deductions, grants, or loans, that are intended to encourage businesses to locate, expand, invest, or remain in South Dakota or to hire or retain employees in South Dakota. Section 2. That chapter 2-6 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: During each interim, the executive board shall direct the committee, pursuant to \u00a7 2-9-4, to analyze incentives and report the committee's findings and any associated recommended legislation to the executive board. By July 1, 2016, and by July first each year thereafter, the committee shall develop a four-year schedule for evaluating each economic development incentive program. Each schedule shall include a list of incentives in the state. In developing the schedule, the committee shall ensure that each incentive is evaluated at least once every four years, except any incentive the committee exempts from evaluation pursuant to this section. To the extent practicable, the committee shall schedule incentives with similar goals to be evaluated in the same year to facilitate a comparison between the effectiveness of each incentive. If the committee determines that the Department of Legislative Audit has inadequate staffing to evaluate each incentive on a four-year schedule, the committee may exempt certain incentives from evaluation. The committee shall prioritize for evaluation incentives that currently cost state and local government the most money in terms of government spending or foregone revenue or which are projected to cost the most in the future. Section 3. That chapter 2-6 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: By October 1, 2016, and by October first each year thereafter, the committee shall evaluate each incentive scheduled for review that year and shall hold public hearings to receive information concerning the incentives. The committee shall provide the results of the evaluations to the executive board in a written report by November 1, 2016, and by November first each year thereafter. The committee shall hold a public hearing on the evaluation results before it submits the evaluation results to the executive board. Section 4. That chapter 2-6 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Each evaluation of an incentive shall include the following: (1) A statement of the goals of the incentive; (2) An assessment of whether the incentive is being administered effectively; (3) An estimate of the economic and fiscal impact of the incentive. This estimate shall take into account the following considerations in addition to other relevant factors: (a) The extent to which the incentive changes business behavior in a beneficial way; (b) The results of the incentive for the economy of South Dakota as a whole. This consideration includes both positive direct and indirect impacts and any negative effects on other South Dakota businesses; and (c) The net results relative to alternative uses of the state's resources. This consideration may include comparisons to the results of other incentives or other economic development strategies with similar goals; (4) An assessment of whether adequate protections are in place to ensure the cost of the incentive does not increase substantially beyond the state's expectations in future years; (5) An assessment of the fiscal impact of the incentive on the budgets of local governments, if applicable; (6) An assessment of whether the incentive is achieving its goals; (7) A determination of whether the effectiveness of the tax incentive could be ascertained more definitively if the Legislature were to clarify or modify the incentive's goals and intended purpose; (8) Recommendations for how South Dakota can most effectively achieve the incentive's goals, including recommendations for whether the incentive should be continued or modified, or whether the state may be better served by using other incentives or strategies to achieve the incentive's goals; and (9) Recommendations for any changes to state policy, laws, or rules that would allow the committee to more easily or conclusively evaluate the incentive in the future. These recommendations may include changes to data collection, reporting, and sharing, and clarifications to the goal of the incentive. Section 5. That chapter 2-6 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: At the request of the Department of Legislative Audit or the committee, state agencies shall provide any records, information, data, or data analysis necessary for the committee to fulfill its responsibilities pursuant to this Act.
