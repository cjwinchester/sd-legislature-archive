BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 4-5-29.1 be amended to read as follows: 4-5-29.1. Pursuant to S.D. Const., Art. XII, \u00a7 5, the state investment officer shall determine the market value of the health care trust fund as of December 31, 2003, and each calendar year thereafter less the investment expenses transferred pursuant to \u00a7 4-5-30.

Upon notice of that amount by the state investment officer, the state treasurer shall transfer the amount from the health care trust fund to the state general fund as soon as practicable after July first of the next fiscal year.
