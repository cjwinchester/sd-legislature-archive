BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 58-41-2 be amended to read: 58-41-2. As used in this chapter a health maintenance organization is a corporation organized under Title 47, controlled and operated as provided in this chapter, which provides, either directly or through arrangements with providers or other persons, comprehensive health maintenance services, or arranges for the provision of such the services, to enrollees on the basis of a fixed prepaid sum without regard to the frequency or extent of services furnished to any particular enrollee.
