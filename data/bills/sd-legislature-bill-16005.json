BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. Any person confined in the state penitentiary for a conviction of murder or any felony under chapter 22-22 may petition a circuit court to order deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) testing on evidence relevant to that person's case and on a sample drawn from that person if the evidence in question has not already been subjected to DNA testing which was introduced at a prior proceeding. For the purposes of this petition, the petitioner is not entitled to court- appointed counsel. The court shall schedule a hearing on the petition within one hundred eighty days. The court on hearing the petition shall consider: (1) The likelihood of sufficient DNA being recovered from the evidence to generate a sufficient sample for testing; and (2) The likelihood that the results of DNA testing, if results do not match the DNA of the petitioner, would, if introduced at trial, produce sufficient reasonable doubt to prevent conviction. If the court finds sufficient evidence, it shall order DNA testing to be done at the state's expense. The sample from the petitioner shall be collected by a health professional licensed or certified to do so. The sample from the evidence shall be collected by a competent professional. If the court determines that the results of testing, if introduced at trial, might reasonably produce sufficient doubt regarding the petitioner's guilt or result in a reversal of the petitioner's conviction, the court shall immediately order a trial de novo. If the test results do not result in a new trial or if the petitioner is reconvicted and that conviction, if appealed, is upheld, the petitioner shall reimburse the state for the costs of the testing. Section 2. Any law enforcement agency of the state shall preserve any DNA evidence in its possession that it knows or should know exists, if that evidence is relevant to any conviction of murder or of any felony under chapter 22-22. No law enforcement agency needs to preserve DNA evidence if the conviction has been overturned and the state has exhausted its appeals or declined to appeal, the convicted person has completed the sentence and has not indicated any intention to appeal, or the convicted person has died without filing an appeal. Section 3. This Act is effective on January 1, 2002."}, {"bill_id": 16005, "bill_version_id": 89834, "bill_version": "Senate Judiciary Engrossed", "bill_version_date": "2001-02-12T16:32:52-06:00", "bill_text": "FOR AN ACT ENTITLED, An Act to provide for DNA testing for certain inmates for the purposes of determining whether they may have been wrongfully convicted.

The petition shall be served on the state's attorney in the county of conviction. Any response shall be filed within sixty days of the date on which the state's attorney was served with the petition. Section 2. Before the court may grant the petition, the petitioner shall demonstrate that post- conviction DNA analysis will: (1) Meet the current test for scientific reliability; (2) Show that the petitioner would be entitled to the testing and that the results would be admissible if the case were being presently tried; (3) Show that a favorable test result would most likely produce an acquittal in a new trial; and (4) Show that the testing will not impose an unreasonable burden on the state. Section 3. The court, in its discretion, may order a hearing on the petition. The court may appoint legal counsel for the petitioner if the court determines that person is indigent and that appointment is in the best interests of justice. Any legal fees and expenses shall be paid by the county from which the person was convicted. Section 4. The court may grant the petition for DNA testing if it determines that petitioner has met the four factors to test set out in section 2 of this Act and that DNA testing is suitable under the circumstances. If the court grants the petition for DNA testing, the court order shall identify the specific evidence to be tested and the DNA technology to be used. The testing shall be conducted by a laboratory mutually agreed upon by the state and the person filing the petition. If the parties cannot agree, the court's order shall designate the laboratory to conduct the testing. DNA testing expenses shall be paid by the county from which the person was convicted. Section 5. The result of any testing ordered under this Act shall be fully disclosed to the person filing the petition and the state's attorney. If the test results do not result in a new trial, the petitioner shall reimburse the county for the costs of the testing. Section 6. Any law enforcement agency of the state shall retain any biological material secured in connection with a criminal case for the period of time that any person remains incarcerated in connection with that case. The agency may determine how the evidence is retained.
