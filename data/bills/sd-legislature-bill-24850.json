The fall enrollment used for the determination of the target teacher ratio for a school district may not include any students residing in a residential treatment facility when the education program is operated by the school district; (4) \"English learner (EL) adjustment,\" is calculated by multiplying 0.25 times the number of kindergarten through twelfth grade students who, in the prior school year, scored below level four on the state-administered language proficiency assessment as required in the state's consolidated state application pursuant to \u00a7 1111(b)(2)(G) of the Every Student Succeeds Act of 2015. For the 2021-2022 calculation only, the EL adjustment is calculated by multiplying 0.25 times the number of kindergarten through twelfth grade students who scored below level four on the state-administered language proficiency assessment in school year 2019-2020 or 2020-2021, whichever is greater; (5) \"Index factor,\" is the annual percentage change in the consumer price index for urban wage earners and clerical workers as computed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States Department of Labor for the year before the year immediately preceding the year of adjustment or three percent, whichever is less; (6) \"Target teacher salary,\" for the school fiscal year beginning July 1, 2023, is $59,659.25.

At that time, the other revenue base amount is calculated as defined above. For a school district created or reorganized after July 1, 2016, the other revenue base amount is the sum of the other revenue base amount for each district before reorganization, and the new school district may not utilize the alternative local need calculation. In the case of the dissolution and annexation of a district, the other revenue base amount of the dissolved school district will be prorated based on the total number of students in the fall enrollment as defined in subdivision (2) who attend each district to which area of the dissolved district were annexed to in the first year of reorganization.

When determining the general fund base percentage, the secretary of the Department of Education shall use the lesser of the school district's fall enrollment as defined in subdivision (2) for the current school year or the school district's fall enrollment from the previous two years; and (19) \"Allowable general fund cash balance,\" the general fund base percentage multiplied by the district's general fund expenditures in the previous school year; and (20) \"Benchmark teacher salary,\" is calculated as follows: (a) For fiscal year 2025, multiply the district's average teacher salary by the percentage adjusted in the target teacher salary as adopted annually by the legislature, for each fiscal year 2018 to 2024, inclusive; or (b) For fiscal year 2026 and every year thereafter, multiply the district's average teacher salary for the previous fiscal year by the percentage adjusted in the target teacher salary as adopted annually by the legislature.

Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of South Dakota: Section 1. That \u00a7 1-45-38 be AMENDED: 1-45-38. There is hereby created the School Finance Accountability Board within the Department of Education. The board shall consist of five members appointed by the Governor. The members shall serve a term of four years. The board may recommend that the provisions of \u00a7 13-13-73.5 be waived for a school district if the district can demonstrate that its lowest monthly general cash fund cash balance percentage is the result of special circumstances. The board may recommend that a penalty against a school district imposed under \u00a7 13-13-73.6 section 5 of this Act be waived, in whole or in part, if the district can demonstrate that its failure to comply with \u00a7 13-13-73.6 or section 4 of this Act is due to special circumstances. The board may recommend the Department of Education review the accreditation of a school district that is found not to be complying with \u00a7\u00a7 13-13-73.5, 13-13-73.6, or section 4 of this Act.

For a waiver recommended by the board under this section, the committee may provide any suggested change to the waiver. Not more than thirty days following receipt of a suggested change from the committee, the board may amend the recommended waiver in accordance with the suggested change and shall resubmit the recommended waiver. The Joint Committee on Appropriations or the Interim Committee on Appropriations shall approve, amend, or deny any waiver recommended by the board. The Department of Education shall annually report to the Governor and the Legislature the information collected pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 13-8-47 and 13-13-73.6. Section 2. That \u00a7 13-8-47 be AMENDED: 13-8-47. Before the first day of August first, every school board shall file an annual report with the Department of Education. The report shall must contain all the educational and financial information and statistics of the school district as requested in a format established by the Department of Education. The report shall must also contain, for each month of the fiscal year, the month-end cash balances of the school district's general fund, capital outlay fund, pension fund, and special education fund. The report shall must also contain the following information for the district from the preceding fiscal year: (1) Total teacher compensation, which is defined as the total amount spent on instructional salaries and benefits for certified instructional staff; (2) Average teacher compensation, which is calculated by dividing the total teacher compensation by the total full-time equivalence of certified instructional staff employed by the school district; (3) The total amount spent on instructional salaries for certified instructional staff; (3)(4) The total amount spent on benefits for certified instructional staff; (4)(5) The total number full-time equivalence of certified instructional staff employed by the school district; and (5)(6) Any other information necessary to comply with the provisions of SL 2016, ch 83.

The division department shall audit the report and return one copy to the school district. Reports not filed prior to August thirtieth are considered past due and are subject to the past-due provisions of \u00a7 13-13-38. Section 3. That \u00a7 13-13-73.6 be AMENDED: 13-13-73.6. The Department of Education shall calculate the following for each school district: (1) The average teacher salary for each school district, based on data collected pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 13-3-51 and 13-8-47; (2) The increase in local need pursuant to \u00a7 13-13-10.1, excluding any effect due to change in the school district's fall enrollment and less the amount of revenue generated in school fiscal year 2016 as a percentage increase, from fiscal year 2016 to fiscal year 2017; and (3) The increase in average teacher compensation as a percentage increase, as defined in \u00a7 13-8-47, from fiscal year 2016 to fiscal year 2017. For each fiscal year from 2019 to 2024, inclusive, if a district's average teacher compensation is less than the district's average teacher compensation in fiscal year 2017, state aid to general education funding to the district in the following fiscal year must be reduced by an amount equal to five hundred dollars for each teacher employed in the school district. A school district may request a waiver from any penalty imposed under this section from the School Finance Accountability Board. Beginning with fiscal year 2025 and every fiscal year thereafter, each school district must increase its average teacher compensation, as referenced in \u00a7 13-8-47, so that cumulative increase in the average teacher compensation since fiscal year 2024 is greater than or equal to fifty percent of the cumulative percentage change in the target teacher salary since fiscal year 2024.

For the purposes of this section, the term \"state minimum salary\" is forty-five thousand dollars for fiscal year 2025. For fiscal year 2026 and thereafter, the state minimum salary is calculated by increasing the previous year's state minimum salary by the percentage change in the target teacher salary from the previous fiscal year to the current fiscal year as adopted by the legislature. Section 5. That a NEW SECTION be added to chapter 13-13: The Department of Education must decrease state aid to general education funding to the school district in the following fiscal year by five hundred dollars for each full-time equivalent teacher employed in the school district if: (1) The school district does not increase the school district's average teacher compensation in accordance with \u00a7 13-13-73.6; or (2) The school district does not pay each full-time equivalent teacher a salary at least equal to the state minimum salary as defined in section 4 of this Act.
