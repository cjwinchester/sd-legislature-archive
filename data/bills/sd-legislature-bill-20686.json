BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. The role and mission of the South Dakota technical institutes is to prepare a well- educated, technically trained, and highly competitive workforce for a rapidly changing world economy. It is the intent of the Legislature that the technical institutes shall provide for a comprehensive program of career, occupational, and technical education for traditional and non- traditional students. Section 2. The technical institutes may provide general academic transfer programs at the following campuses: Lake Area Technical Institute located in Watertown; Mitchell Technical Institute located in Mitchell; Southeast Technical Institute located in Sioux Falls; and Western Dakota Technical Institute located in Rapid City. Section 3. The technical institutes are encouraged to work in cooperation with the South Dakota Board of Regents system for the articulation of all general academic programs. Section 4. The technical institutes may provide such academic course instruction as may be necessary to support applied technology education and academic transfer programs. Section 5. Any technical institute may contract to provide for the delivery of education programs within institutions operated by any state agency or within any geographic area administered by a federal agency or tribal authority. Section 6. The Legislature hereby declares that for a technical institute to be responsible to the people it serves, primary control of such institutes shall be placed in the citizens within the local area so served subject to approval by the South Dakota State Board of Education. It is the intent and purpose of this act to create locally governed and locally supported postsecondary technical institute areas. Each technical institute area is intended to be an independent, local, unique, and vital segment of postsecondary education separate from both the established elementary and secondary school system and from other institutions of postsecondary education and is not to be converted into a four-year, baccalaureate-degree-granting institution. Section 7. It is the intent of the Legislature that a clear distinction between area governance and statewide coordination for the postsecondary technical institute areas be recognized and that such coordination is appropriate in order to provide the most cost-effective programs for residents of this state. It is further the intent of the Legislature that coordination of the technical institutes by the South Dakota Coordinating Commission for Postsecondary Education be conducted through an association of the boards. All of the boards shall be a part of and shall be represented by such association. Coordination services provided by such association shall include: (1) Preparation of a system strategic plan; (2) Coordination of the annual budget request; (3) Facilitation of program-needs assessment and articulation; (4) Recommendation and facilitation of the appointment of representatives to committees, boards, commissions, task forces, and any other state-level bodies requesting or requiring participation form the technical institute system; and (5) Facilitation of responses to data and information requests for the system. Nothing in this section may be construed to require or provide for state control of the operations of any technical institute area or to abridge the governance ability, rights, or responsibilities of any board. Nothing in this section may be construed to limit the ability or authority of the commission to fulfill its responsibilities and duties regarding the individual technical institute areas and the individual technical institute area campuses.
