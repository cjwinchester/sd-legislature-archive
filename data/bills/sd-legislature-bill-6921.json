BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 3-12-55 be amended to read as follows: 3-12-55. The Board of Trustees shall appoint an administrator, qualified by training and experience, to serve at the pleasure of the Board of Trustees. The annual salary of the administrator may be adjusted annually by the same rate appropriated as the across-the-board increase to base salaries of state employees under the General Appropriations Act in each corresponding year. Before May first of each year, the board shall recommend any additional salary adjustment above the across-the-board increase for the administrator for the upcoming fiscal year. This salary adjustment is not effective unless it is approved by a majority vote of the members of the Retirement Laws Committee Executive Board of the Legislative Research Council. The administrator may hire additional employees as may be required to transact the business of the retirement system and shall fix the remuneration for such services. The board shall require the bonding of the administrator in an amount set by the board which shall be included under the state employees' blanket bond. The premium may be charged to the fund."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 6921, "action_date": "2016-01-21T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 37869, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/37869.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 134, "committee_id_action": 325, "committee_id_assigned": 317, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 6921, "action_date": "2016-01-27T08:30:00-06:00", "document_id": 38012, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/38012.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 317, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 6921, "action_date": "2016-01-27T08:30:00-06:00", "document_id": 38205, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/38205.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to the 41st legislative day", "journal_page": 192, "committee_id_action": 317, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 20296, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [1042, 983, 1022, 1002, 1044, 1024, 1003, 981, 1029, 990, 1025, 976], "Nay": [989]}}]}
