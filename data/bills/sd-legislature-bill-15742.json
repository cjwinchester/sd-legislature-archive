BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. Except as provided for in sections 2 and 3 of this Act, a school district is eligible for transportation aid to be calculated according to the following steps: Step 1. For each school district determine the total number of regular bus route miles for buses owned by the district plus the total number of regular bus route miles for buses contracted by the district. Step 2. For each school district determine the daily average number of students transported to and from school by district owned buses or contracted buses. Step 3. For each school district determine the number of days bus service is provided by district owned buses or contracted buses. Step 4. Divide the result of step 1 by the result of step 2. Step 5. Divide the result of step 4 by the result of step 3. Step 6. Divide the result of step 5 by 2. Step 7. Subtract 0.3 from the result of step 6. Step 8. Subtract 0.3 from the result of step 7. Step 9. Raise the result of step 8 to the 1.25 power. Step 10. Multiply the result of step 9 times the result of step 2. Step 11. Multiply the result of step 10 times 175. Step 12.
