No person may engage in the practice of radiologic technology unless licensed or exempted from licensure pursuant to this Act. A violation of this section is a Class 2 misdemeanor. The board may file a civil action to enjoin any person engaging in the practice of radiologic technology without a license. Section 10. The board shall issue a license to practice radiologic technology to any person who meets the requirements of this Act. The classifications of licensing are radiologic technologist or limited X ray machine operators. Section 11. An applicant for licensure as a radiologic technologist or a limited X ray machine operator shall meet the following requirements: (1) Be at least eighteen years of age; (2) Be of good moral character; and (3) Meet the education and certification requirements as provided by this Act. The applicant shall submit an application in a form prescribed by the board and pay a fee as established by the board in rules promulgated pursuant to chapter 1-26. Section 12. The board shall license any person as a radiologic technologist if the person meets one of the following requirements: (1) Board-certified or eligible for certification by the American Registry of Radiologic Technologists; or (2) Board-certified or eligible for certification by the Nuclear Medicine Technology Certification Board. However, the board may deny a license of a person certified as required by this section for good cause. Section 13. No person, except as provided by section 14 of this Act, may be licensed as a limited X ray machine operator unless the person has attained a passing score, as established by the board in rules promulgated pursuant to chapter 1-26, of the limited X ray machine operator examination developed by the American Registry of Radiologic Technologists. Section 14. No person may practice as a limited operator after June 30, 2007, unless the person has met the requirements for licensure as provided in this Act. Any person who has actively practiced as a limited X ray machine operator for at least six months but less than two years prior to June 30, 2007, shall complete fifteen hundred hours of X ray training or provide documentation of fifteen hundred hours of X ray training and successfully complete the limited X ray machine operator examination developed by the American Registry of Radiologic Technologists. The board shall, in rules promulgated pursuant to chapter 1-26, establish the requirements of training and the minimum score required for successful completion of the examination. Any person who has been actively practicing as a limited X ray operator for more than two years prior to June 30, 2007, is exempt from the training requirements but shall demonstrate competence, as required by rules promulgated by the board pursuant to chapter 1-26, and successfully complete the limited X ray machine operator examination as developed by the American Registry of Radiologic Technologists. After June 30, 2010, the board may only license applicants who have met the requirements for a radiologic technologist license in section 12 of this Act. Section 15.

The licensee shall return the application with the required fee to the board before the expiration date. Upon receipt of the application and fee, the board shall review the application and issue the licensee a certificate of renewal. Failure to receive the application for renewal of license does not relieve the licensee of the responsibility for renewing the license and paying the renewal fee within the prescribed time. Failure of a licensee to renew the license constitutes a forfeiture of the license. However, any person who has forfeited a license may have it restored by submitting a written application and paying the biennial renewal fee and the late renewal fee. Late renewal of a license may not be granted more than one year after its expiration. The board shall establish, by rule promulgated pursuant to chapter 1-26, requirements for continuing education or retesting for any person who has not been licensed for a continuous period of time greater than one year.

Section 21. A proceeding for cancellation, suspension, or revocation of a license may be initiated if the board has evidence that any person may have been guilty of any misconduct or gross incompetence or unprofessional or dishonorable conduct. Section 22. Any proceeding relative to the cancellation, suspension, or revocation of a license shall conform to the procedures set forth in chapter 1-26. Section 23.
