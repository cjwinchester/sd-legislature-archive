WHEREAS, the Missouri River is the lifeblood of the State of South Dakota, providing fresh potable water for dozens of rural water systems and municipalities within the state; and WHEREAS, from these water systems, tens of thousands of South Dakotans and hundreds of thousands of domestic livestock and wildlife receive their life-sustaining clean water; and WHEREAS, the Missouri River is also the foundation of a thriving outdoor recreational economy for the state, providing a haven for abundant fish and wildlife resources that attract fisherman and hunters from throughout the country; and WHEREAS, the Missouri River is one of the last pristine bodies of water in the United States, serving as a testament to a strong state environmental policy that preserves and protects clean, fresh water; and WHEREAS, with the proposal of the Dakota Access Pipeline, the increasing hunger for the fossil fuels being extracted in western North Dakota is now encroaching into South Dakota's Missouri River water supply; and WHEREAS, the Dakota Access Pipeline, if built, would cross the Missouri River at Lake Oahe less than forty miles from South Dakota's northern border; and WHEREAS, the pipeline, as proposed, would be the longest crude oil pipeline ever built under a freshwater body in the world; and WHEREAS, in order to lay a pipeline such as the one proposed under the Missouri River at Lake Oahe, the contractor must ream out a 48-inch hole down vertically for 92 feet, then horizontally for approximately 1.5 miles, and then pull a 30-inch diameter pipe around two corners (at the entry and exit points) and all the way through the bore hole; and WHEREAS, by its very nature, this process creates a real risk of stress fractures on the pipe under the surface of the earth because the 7,800 feet of steel pipeline will literally be stretched like an elastic rubber band; and WHEREAS, it is inevitable that some of this pipeline will be damaged, which means that damaged pipeline will be installed 92 feet under the fresh waters of the Missouri River at Lake Oahe; and WHEREAS, once installed, and despite the use of best available technology, it will be nearly impossible to detect or remedy a leak from the damaged pipe; and WHEREAS, subsurface pipeline leaks 92 feet under the bed of the Missouri River would be complicated if not impossible to clean up and would likely have significant impacts on the soils and on the Hall Creek and Fox Hills aquifers underlying Lake Oahe; and WHEREAS, because of the costs and effort that would be needed to repair or replace a ruptured or damaged pipeline section, it is likely that any spill would be allowed to remain, and the pipeline would simply be abandoned in place, leaving any remaining crude oil to leak into the pristine waters of Lake Oahe on the Missouri River; and WHEREAS, Lake Oahe on the Missouri River has a freshwater treatment plant, but the plant has no ability to treat benzene originated from a crude oil spill; and WHEREAS, over the last twenty years, (1995-2014) there were 10,884 pipeline incidents in the United States, or an average of 1.5 incidents per day. This included 5,599 \"significant\" pipeline incidents or leaks, which equals two serious events every three days. Based on historical facts, the likelihood of the Dakota Access Pipeline rupturing sometime in the future is almost certain; and WHEREAS, any leakage of crude oil into a large body of water such as the Missouri River and its underlying soils and aquifers would have catastrophic effects on the nature and environment downstream from the spill, including human consumption, agricultural use, domestic and wildlife animal consumption, and recreational use: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the Senate of the Ninety-Second Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the House of Representatives concurring therein, that the Legislature recognizes the entire state's dependence on the Missouri River for clean drinking water, for the economic benefits of its recreational use, and for the healthy natural ecosystem it supports; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Legislature needs to ensure that the waters of the Missouri forever remain pristine and free from pollutants, including those that may happen upstream in other states; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that because of the threat to the Missouri River posed by the construction and operation of one of the largest and longest crude oil pipelines under a fresh water body in the world, the Legislature hereby declares its opposition to the Dakota Access Pipeline; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the secretary of state transmit duly authenticated copies of this resolution to the speaker and clerk of the United States House of Representatives, to the president pro tempore and secretary of the United States Senate, and to the members of the South Dakota Congressional delegation."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 8188, "action_date": "2017-02-02T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 43748, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/43748.pdf", "status_text": "First read and referred to", "journal_page": 269, "committee_id_action": 360, "committee_id_assigned": 340, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 8188, "action_date": "2017-02-08T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 43926, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/43926.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 340, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 8188, "action_date": "2017-02-08T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 44099, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/44099.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to the 41st legislative day", "journal_page": 337, "committee_id_action": 340, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 23022, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [1154, 1148, 1169, 1131, 1144, 1108], "Nay": [1105, 1107, 1102]}}]}
