That chapter 1-8 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: The Office of the Secretary of State may neither make nor enforce any rule, policy, protocol, or practice that would prevent any persons from filing hard copy or paper copy in fulfilling an obligation to provide any document, data, information, or other material to the Office of the Secretary of State if the filer elects to do so. However, nothing in this Act prohibits the Office of the Secretary of State from converting any hard copy or paper copy filing to some other form for storage or retrieval. However, the costs of the conversion may not be assessed to the hard copy or paper copy filer. 170 copies were printed on recycled paper by the South Dakota Legislative Research Council at a cost of $.093 per page. . Insertions into existing statutes are indicated by underscores. Deletions from existing statutes are indicated by overstrikes."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 38, "action_date": "2013-01-18T13:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 24090, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/24090.pdf", "status_text": "First read in Senate and referred to", "journal_page": 145, "committee_id_action": 200, "committee_id_assigned": 185, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 38, "action_date": "2013-01-28T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 24640, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/24640.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 185, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 38, "action_date": "2013-01-28T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 24778, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/24778.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to the 41st legislative day", "journal_page": 232, "committee_id_action": 185, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 13013, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [337, 340, 364, 345, 329, 320, 328, 333, 339]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/38"}
