BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. An employer shall grant an employee leave not to exceed sixteen hours during any twelve-month period to attend school conferences or school-related activities involving the employee's child if the conferences or school-related activities cannot be scheduled during nonwork hours. If the employee's child receives child care services provided in family day care homes as defined in \u00a7 \u00a7 26-6-14 and 26-6-14.1, group day care homes, nursery schools, day nurseries, child day care centers, head start, or extended day school age child care programs in or out of the child's home, or attends a prekindergarten regular or special education program, the employee may use the leave time provided in this section to attend a conference or activity related to the employee's child, or to observe and monitor the services or program, if the conference, activity, or observation cannot be scheduled during nonwork hours. If the leave cannot be scheduled during nonwork hours and the need for the leave is foreseeable, the employee shall provide reasonable prior notice of the leave and make a reasonable effort to schedule the leave so as not to unduly disrupt the operations of the employer. Any leave granted pursuant to this Act may be paid or unpaid leave, at the discretion of the employer."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 14206, "action_date": "1999-01-29T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 81759, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/81759.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 267, "committee_id_action": 628, "committee_id_assigned": 623, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 14206, "action_date": "1999-02-05T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 81960, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/81960.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 623, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 14206, "action_date": "1999-02-05T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 81960, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/81960.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to 41st legislative day", "journal_page": 390, "committee_id_action": 623, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 40984, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [2208, 2228, 2245, 2247, 2257, 2282, 2287, 2266, 2214], "Nay": [2232, 2240, 2254, 2262]}}, {"bill_id": 14206, "action_date": "1999-02-05T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 81960, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/81960.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to 41st legislative day", "journal_page": 390, "committee_id_action": 623, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 40984, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [2208, 2228, 2245, 2247, 2257, 2282, 2287, 2266, 2214], "Nay": [2232, 2240, 2254, 2262]}}]}
