Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a law enforcement agency may shall provide notice, in writing, of an incident within its jurisdiction to public or nonpublic school officials and to the parent or guardian of a school student if the incident is one in which the agency has probable cause to believe the school student has violated any provision of state law involving alcohol, illegal drugs, firearms, or bomb threats, or has made any threat of violence relating to any school or its students, employees, or property. However, if there is a prolonged criminal investigation and revealing information would jeopardize a successful conclusion to the case, the law enforcement agency may provide the notice at some later appropriate time. The notice shall be in writing. 180 copies of this document were printed by the South Dakota Legislative Research Council at a cost of $.052 per page. .
