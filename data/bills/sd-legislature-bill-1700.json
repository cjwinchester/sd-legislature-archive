BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 3-6-7 be amended to read as follows: 3-6-7. In addition to the leave of absence for vacation as provided in \u00a7 3-6-6, each employee of the state, except temporary and emergency employees as defined by Career Service Commission rules, and patient, inmate, and student employees, is entitled to fourteen days leave of absence for sickness without loss of pay, exclusive of Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays, for each year the employee is in the employment of the state. Leave of absence for sickness shall be accrued on an hourly, biweekly, semimonthly, or monthly basis as determined by the commissioner of personnel and shall accumulate without limit as to the number of days of such accumulation. All leave of absence for sickness shall be supported by a medical certificate upon the request of the commissioner of personnel. No employee is entitled to more than his or her accrued and earned leave of absence for sickness without first using up any and all of his or her accumulated and earned leave of absence for vacation. An employee may use up to five days of his or her sick leave in each calendar year for personal emergency reasons. Leave for personal emergencies may not be accrued from year to year. The Career Service Commission, pursuant to chapter 1-26, shall adopt rules defining the term, personal emergency, to implement this provision. An employee may use up to twelve weeks of accumulated sick leave to care for a spouse, child, or parent of the employee if the spouse, child, or parent has a serious health condition as defined under the federal Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993. Adoption of a child by any state employee is treated as natural childbirth for leave purposes."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 1700, "action_date": "2010-01-28T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 11385, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/11385.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 223, "committee_id_action": 86, "committee_id_assigned": 79, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 1700, "action_date": "2010-02-10T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 11853, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/11853.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 79, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 1700, "action_date": "2010-02-10T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 12022, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/12022.pdf", "status_text": "Referred to", "journal_page": 346, "committee_id_action": 79, "committee_id_assigned": 75, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 6266, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [771, 756, 765, 798, 826, 788, 800, 744, 786, 796, 750, 748], "Excused": [762]}}, {"bill_id": 1700, "action_date": "2010-02-18T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 12310, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/12310.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 75, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 1700, "action_date": "2010-02-18T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 12510, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/12510.pdf", "status_text": "Tabled", "journal_page": 458, "committee_id_action": 75, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 6697, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [821, 771, 844, 820, 835, 842, 788, 827, 770, 840, 823, 786, 751]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/1700"}
