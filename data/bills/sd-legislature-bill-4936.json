No court may order the release of abuse or neglect information pertaining to any report which has not been substantiated by a Department of Social Services investigation or prior to a court finding of abuse or neglect. No court may order release of information revealing the identity of a party reporting abuse or neglect. The department may not release information subject to the Health Information Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended to January 1, 2008, the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, as amended to January 1, 2008, or the federal rules governing confidentiality of alcohol and drug abuse patient records pursuant to 42 C.F.R.

All investigative case records and files relating to reports of child abuse or neglect are confidential, and no disclosure of any such records, files, or other information may be made except as authorized in chapter 26-7A or this chapter. Any person who knowingly violates the confidential nature of the records, files, or information is guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor. The Department of Social Services may release records, files, or other information to the following parties upon the receipt by the department of a request showing that it is necessary for the parties to have such information in the performance of official functions relating to child abuse or neglect: (1) The attorney general, the state's attorneys, law enforcement agencies, protective services workers, and judges of the courts investigating reports of known or suspected child abuse or neglect; (2) The attorney or guardian ad litem of the child who is the subject of the information; (3) Public officials or their authorized representatives who require the information in connection with the discharge of official duties; (4) Institutions and agencies that have legal responsibility or authorization to care for, treat, or supervise a child who is the subject of the information or report; (5) An adoptive or foster parent of the child who is the subject of the information or report; (6) A state, regional, or national registry of child abuse and neglect cases and courts of record of other states; (7) A validly appointed and registered child protection team under \u00a7 26-8A-17; (8) A physician who is caring for a child whom the physician reasonably suspects may be abused or neglected; (9) State hearing examiners and any person who is the subject of the report for purposes directly related to review under \u00a7 26-8A-11; and (10) A person eligible to submit an adoptive home study report under \u00a7 25-6-9.1 or 26-4- 15.

However, the court may order the authorized receiving party to release of the information or any portion of it necessary for determination of an issue before the court. However, the Department of Social Services may release information and findings to the media regarding the abuse or neglect of a child that resulted in a fatality or near fatality of the child if the release of the information has been approved by the prosecutor who has commenced or who has authority to commence legal action, and, if such disclosure has been authorized by the court and is not contrary to the best interests of the child, the child's siblings, or other children in the household. The information to be released shall relate to the acts of child abuse or neglect that caused the fatality or near fatality of the child. However, the identity of the child may never be released. For the purpose of this chapter, near fatality means an act that, as certified by a physician, places the child in serious or critical condition."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 4936, "action_date": "2008-01-08T12:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 563, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/563.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 29, "committee_id_action": 27, "committee_id_assigned": 25, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 4936, "action_date": "2008-01-23T07:30:00-06:00", "document_id": 1212, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/1212.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 25, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 4936, "action_date": "2008-01-25T07:30:00-06:00", "document_id": 1713, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/1713.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 25, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 4936, "action_date": "2008-01-28T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 1859, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/1859.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 25, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 4936, "action_date": "2008-01-28T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 1961, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/1961.pdf", "status_text": "Tabled", "journal_page": 278, "committee_id_action": 25, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 746, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [625, 555, 568, 580, 556, 628, 581, 554, 606, 587, 561, 570], "Excused": [575]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/4936"}
