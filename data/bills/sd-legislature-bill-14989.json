BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That chapter 10-6 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Notwithstanding the provisions of \u00a7 10-6-33, agricultural land shall be assessed based on its agricultural income value. The agricultural income value of agricultural land shall be determined on the basis of productivity and the annual earnings capacity of the agricultural land if the land is used for agricultural purposes. The productivity of land and its annual earning capacity shall be based on data collected and analyzed pursuant to sections 2 to 5, inclusive, of this Act. Section 2. That chapter 10-6 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Agricultural income value is defined as the capitalized average annual earning capacity. The annual earning capacity shall be determined from crop share rent, cash rent, or a combination thereof, reduced by the estimated property taxes and crop marketing expenses incurred by agricultural land owners renting agricultural land on a crop share or cash basis. For the purpose of this section, annual earning capacity for: (1) Cropland is thirty percent of the annual gross income produced; (2) Noncropland is twenty-five percent of the annual gross income capacity of the land based upon the animal carrying capacity of the land. The economics department of South Dakota State University shall annually compute the average annual earning capacity of cropland and noncropland for each county using the data base defined in section 4 of this Act. The average annual earning capacity shall be capitalized at a rate of six percent to determine the capitalized average annual earning capacity. The economics department shall annually provide the secretary of revenue this information by June first. Section 3. That chapter 10-6 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Before July first, the secretary of revenue shall annually provide each director of equalization the agricultural income value for each county as computed pursuant to section 2 of this Act. Before November first the director of equalization shall annually determine the assessed value of agricultural land. Agricultural land shall be assessed based on its agricultural income value and adjusted by the following factors: (1) The capacity of the land to produce agricultural products as defined in \u00a7 10-6-33.2; and (2) The soil survey statistics, terrain, and topographical condition of the land including the climate, accessibility, and surface obstructions which can be documented.

A data base for an identifiable region within a county may be created if the director of equalization shows a need for establishing identifiable regions within a county. The secretary shall collect such data for 1993, which will serve as the first year of the data base, and each year thereafter. The data base shall consist of the most recent eight years of data that have been collected and the years representing the highest and lowest agricultural income value shall be discarded from the data base. The data base for the 2002 assessment year shall consist of data from 1993 to 2000, inclusive, and the data base for each assessment year thereafter shall be adjusted accordingly. Section 5. That chapter 10-6 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Agricultural land shall be divided into categories, including cropland and noncropland, so that the categories reflect uses appropriate for the valuation of such land.
