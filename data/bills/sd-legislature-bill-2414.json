BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 55-1B-2 be amended to read as follows: 55-1B-2. An excluded fiduciary is not liable, either individually or as a fiduciary, for any of the following: (1) Any loss that results from compliance with a direction of the trust advisor, custodial account owner, or authorized designee of a custodial account owner; (2) Any loss that results from a failure to take any action proposed by an excluded fiduciary that requires a prior authorization of the trust advisor if that excluded fiduciary timely sought but failed to obtain that authorization; (3) Any loss that results from any action or inaction, except for gross negligence or willful misconduct, when an excluded fiduciary is required, pursuant to the trust agreement or any other reason, to assume the role of trust advisor, trust protector, investment trust advisor, or distribution trust advisor. Any excluded fiduciary is also relieved from any obligation to perform investment or suitability reviews, inquiries, or investigations or to make recommendations or evaluations with respect to any investments to the extent the trust advisor, custodial account owner, or authorized designee of a custodial account owner had authority to direct the acquisition, disposition, or retention of any such investment. If the excluded fiduciary offers such communication to the trust advisor, trust protector, investment trust advisor, or distribution trust advisor or any investment person selected by the investment trust advisor, such action may not be deemed to constitute an undertaking by the excluded fiduciary to monitor or otherwise participate in actions within the scope of the advisor's authority or to constitute any duty to do so. Any excluded fiduciary is also relieved of any duty to communicate with or warn or apprise any beneficiary or third party concerning instances in which the excluded fiduciary would or might have exercised the excluded fiduciary's own discretion in a manner different from the manner directed by the trust advisor, trust protector, investment trust advisor, or distribution trust advisor. Absent clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, the actions of the excluded fiduciary pertaining to matters within the scope of authority of the trust advisor, trust protector, investment trust advisor, or distribution trust advisor (such as confirming that the advisor's directions have been carried out and recording and reporting actions taken at the advisor's direction) shall be presumed to be administrative actions taken by the excluded fiduciary solely to allow the excluded fiduciary to perform those duties assigned to the excluded fiduciary under the governing instrument, and such administrative actions may not be deemed to constitute an undertaking by the excluded fiduciary to monitor or otherwise participate in actions within the scope of authority of the trust advisor, trust protector, investment trust advisor, or distribution trust advisor. Nothing in subdivision (2) imposes an obligation or liability with respect to a custodian of a custodial account. Section 2. That \u00a7 55-5-16 be amended to read as follows: 55-5-16. A trustee has a duty to personally perform the responsibilities of the trusteeship except as a prudent person might delegate those responsibilities to others. In deciding whether, to whom, and in what manner to delegate fiduciary authority in the administration of a trust, and thereafter in monitoring agents, the trustee may seek the prior approval for the delegation from all known beneficiaries of the trust or from the court. If such approval is given in writing by all known beneficiaries or by the court, the trustee is not liable for the acts of the person to whom the authority is delegated except in the cases of gross willful misconduct or gross negligence by the delegating trustee in the selection or monitoring of the agent. Section 3. That \u00a7 55-1B-1 be amended to read as follows: 55-1B-1.

Unless the terms of the document provide otherwise, the distribution trust advisor shall direct the trustee with regard to all discretionary distributions to beneficiaries and may direct appointments pursuant to \u00a7 55-2-15. The distribution trust advisor may also provide direction regarding notification of qualified beneficiaries pursuant to \u00a7 55-2-13. Section 6. That \u00a7 55-16-4 be amended to read as follows: 55-16-4. Neither the transferor nor any other natural person who is a nonresident of this state nor an entity that is not authorized by the law of this state to act as a trustee or whose activities are not subject to supervision as provided in \u00a7 55-16-3 may be considered a qualified person. However, nothing in this chapter precludes a transferor from appointing, removing, or replacing one or more co-trustees, trust advisors, or trust protectors, or other fiduciaries as defined in subdivision 55-1B-1(4), including: (1) A fiduciary who has authority under the terms of the trust instrument to remove and appoint qualified persons or trust advisors; (2) A fiduciary who has authority under the terms of the trust instrument to direct, consent to, or disapprove distribution from the trust; and (3) A fiduciary whether or not such fiduciary would meet the requirements imposed by \u00a7 55-16-3 regardless of whether or not such trust advisor or trust protector is a fiduciary. Section 7. That chapter 51A-6A be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: An entity may be excluded from the provisions of chapters 51A-5, 51A-6, and 51A-6A if: (1) The entity is established for the exclusive purpose of acting as a trust protector, investment trust advisor, or distribution trust advisor, as defined by \u00a7 55-1B-1; (2) The entity is acting in such capacity under a trust instrument which names a South Dakota trust company, a South Dakota bank with trust powers, or a national bank with trust powers as trustee; (3) The entity is not engaged in trust company business with the general public as a public trust company or with any family as a private trust company; (4) The entity does not hold itself out as being in the business of acting as a fiduciary for hire as either a public or private trust company; (5) The entity files an annual report with the South Dakota secretary of state and provides a copy to the Division of Banking; and (6) The entity agrees to be subject to examination by the Division of Banking at the discretion of the director. The governing documents of any such excluded entity shall limit its authorized activities to the functions permitted to a trust protector, investment trust advisor, or distribution trust advisor pursuant to chapter 55-1B and limit the performance of those functions with respect to a specifically named trust or family of trusts. An entity complying with this section shall notify the director of its existence, capacity to act, and the name of the trustee for the trust or family of trusts. Section 8. That \u00a7 55-2-13 be amended to read as follows: 55-2-13. For purposes of this section, the term, qualified beneficiary, means a beneficiary that is an entity then in existence or an individual who is twenty-one years of age or older and who, on the date the beneficiary's qualification is determined: (1) Is a distributee or permissible distributee of trust income or principal; (2) Would be a distributee or permissible distributee of trust income or principal if the interests of the distributees terminated on that date; or (3) Would be a distributee or permissible distributee of trust income or principal if the trust terminated on that date. However, if the distributee is then unknown because a person holds a power to change the distributee, the trustee shall give notice only to the holder of the power. Except as otherwise provided by the terms of a revocable trust, a trustee has no duty to notify the qualified beneficiaries of the trust's existence. Except as otherwise provided by the terms of an irrevocable trust or otherwise directed in writing by the settlor, distribution trust advisor, or trust protector, the trustee shall, within sixty days after the trustee has accepted trusteeship of the trust, or within sixty days after the date the trustee acquires knowledge that a formerly revocable trust has become irrevocable, notify the qualified beneficiaries of the trust's existence and of the right of the beneficiary to request a copy of the trust instrument pertaining to the beneficiary's interest in the trust. Subject to the previous provision Except as otherwise provided by the terms of an irrevocable trust or otherwise directed in writing by the settlor, trust advisor, or trust protector, a trustee of an irrevocable trust: (1) Upon request of a qualified beneficiary, shall promptly furnish to the qualified beneficiary a copy of the trust instrument; (2) If notification of the trust has not been accomplished pursuant to this section within sixty days after accepting a trusteeship, shall notify the qualified beneficiaries of the acceptance and of the trustee's name, address, and telephone number; (3) Shall promptly respond to a qualified beneficiary's request for information related to the administration of the trust, unless the request is unreasonable under the circumstances. The settlor, trust advisor, or trust protector, may, by the terms of the governing instrument, or in writing delivered to the trustee, expand, restrict, eliminate, or otherwise modify the rights of beneficiaries to information relating to a trust. A beneficiary may waive the right to the notice or information otherwise required to be furnished under this section and, with respect to future reports and other information, may withdraw a waiver previously given. The change in the identity of a trustee, occurring as the result of a mere name change or a merger, consolidation, combination, or reorganization of a trustee, does not require notice. If a fiduciary is bound by a duty of confidentiality with respect to a trust or its assets, a fiduciary may require that any beneficiary who is eligible to receive information pursuant to this section be bound by the duty of confidentiality that binds the trustee before receiving such information from the trustee. A trust advisor, trust protector, or other fiduciary designated by the terms of the trust shall keep each excluded fiduciary designated by the terms of the trust reasonably informed about: (1) The administration of the trust with respect to any specific duty or function being performed by the trust advisor, trust protector, or other fiduciary to the extent that the duty or function would normally be performed by the excluded fiduciary or to the extent that providing such information to the excluded fiduciary is reasonably necessary for the excluded fiduciary to perform its duties; and (2) Any other material information that the excluded fiduciary would be required to disclose to the qualified beneficiaries under this section regardless of whether the terms of the trust relieve the excluded fiduciary from providing such information to qualified beneficiaries. Neither the performance nor the failure to perform of a trust advisor, trust protector, or other fiduciary designated by the terms of the trust as provided in this subdivision shall affect the limitation on the liability of the excluded fiduciary. The provisions of this section are effective for trusts created after June 30, 2002, except as otherwise directed by the settlor, trust protector, or distribution trust advisor, or other fiduciary designated by the terms of the trust. For trusts created before July 1, 2002, a trustee has no duty at common law or otherwise to notify a qualified beneficiary of the trust's existence unless otherwise directed by the settlor.

A beneficial interest specifically excludes a power of appointment or a power reserved by the settlor; (2) \"Beneficiary,\" a person that has a present or future beneficial interest in a trust, vested or contingent. The holder of a power of appointment is not a beneficiary; (3) \"Distribution beneficiary,\" a beneficiary who is an eligible distributee or permissible distributee of trust income or principal; (4) \"Distribution interest,\" a distribution interest held by a distribution beneficiary. A distribution interest may be a current distribution interest or a future distribution interest. A distribution interest may be classified as a mandatory interest, a support interest, or a discretionary interest; (5) \"Power of appointment,\" an inter-vivos or testamentary power to direct the disposition of trust property, other than a distribution decision by a trustee to a beneficiary. Powers of appointment are held by a person to whom a power has been given, not the settlor; (6) \"Reach,\" with respect to a distribution interest or power, to subject the distribution interest or power to a judgment, decree, garnishment, attachment, execution, levy, creditor's bill or other legal, equitable, or administrative process, relief, or control of any court, tribunal, agency, or other entity as provided by law; (7) \"Remainder interest,\" an interest where a trust beneficiary will receive the property outright at some time during the future; (8) \"Reserved power,\" a power held by the settlor.

That \u00a7 55-1-31 be amended to read as follows: 55-1-31. Unless otherwise provided in the trust, if the settlor's spouse is named as beneficiary, the settlor's spouse is still living, and the trust is classified as a support trust, then the trustee shall consider the beneficiary's resources of the settlor's spouse, including the settlor's obligation of support, prior to making a distribution. In all other cases, unless otherwise provided in the trust, the trustee need not consider the beneficiary's resources in determining whether a distribution should be made. Section 34. That \u00a7 55-1-35 be amended to read as follows: 55-1-35. A declaration in a trust that the interest of a beneficiary shall be held subject to a spendthrift trust is sufficient to restrain voluntary or involuntary alienation of a beneficial interest by a beneficiary to the maximum extent provided by law. Regardless of whether a beneficiary has any outstanding creditor, a trustee of a spendthrift trust may directly pay any expense on behalf of such beneficiary and may exhaust the income and principal of the trust for the benefit of such beneficiary. No trustee is liable to any creditor for paying the expenses of a beneficiary of a spendthrift trust. Section 35. That \u00a7 55-1-36 be amended to read as follows: 55-1-36. If a settlor is also a beneficiary of the trust, and the transfer is a qualified transfer under chapter 55-16, the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 55-1-24 to 55-1-43, inclusive, also apply. Conversely, if the settlor is a beneficiary of the trust and the transfer is not a qualified transfer under chapter 55-16, a provision restraining the voluntary or involuntary transfer of the settlor's beneficial interest does not prevent the settlor's creditors from satisfying claims from the settlor's interest in the trust estate, unless the transfer specifically references and is qualified as a transfer under chapter 55-16. However, regardless of whether the transfer is a qualified transfer under chapter 55-16, a settlor's creditors may not satisfy claims from either assets of the trust because of the existence of a discretionary power granted to the trustee by the terms of the trust instrument creating the trust, or any other provisions of law, to pay directly to the taxing authorities or to reimburse the settlor for any tax on trust income or principal which is payable by the settlor under the law imposing such tax; or reimbursements made to the settlor or direct tax payments made to a taxing authority for the settlor's benefit for any tax or trust income or principal which is payable by the trustor under the law imposing such tax. Section 36. That chapter 55-1 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no action of any kind, including an action to enforce a judgement entered by a court or other body having adjudicative authority, may be brought at law or in equity for an attachment or other provisional remedy against property that is the subject of a South Dakota trust or for avoidance of a transfer to a South Dakota trust unless the settlor's transfer of property was made with the intent to defraud that specific creditor. Section 37. That chapter 55-1 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: A cause of action or claim for relief with respect to a fraudulent transfer of a settlor's assets pursuant to \u00a7 55-1-44 is extinguished unless the action under \u00a7 55-1-44 is brought by a creditor of the settlor who meets one of the following requirements: (1) Is a creditor of the settlor before the settlor's assets are transferred to the trust, and the action under \u00a7 55-1-44 is brought within the later of: (a) Three years after the transfer is made; or (b) One year after the transfer is or reasonably could have been discovered by the creditor if the creditor: (i) Can demonstrate that the creditor asserted a specific claim against the settlor before the transfer; or (ii) Files another action, other than an action under \u00a755-1-44, against the settlor that asserts a claim based on an act or omission of the settlor that occurred before the transfer, and the action described in this subsection is filed within three years after the transfer; or (2) Becomes a creditor subsequent to the transfer into trust, and the action under \u00a7 55-1-44 is brought within three years after the transfer is made. Section 38. That \u00a7 51A-6A-7 be amended to read as follows: 51A-6A-7. Any three or more persons may organize a trust company and make and file articles as provided by the laws of this state. No trust company may be organized or incorporated to engage in business as such until the articles have been submitted and approved in accordance with \u00a7 51A-6A-4. The name selected for the trust company may not be the name of any other trust company doing business in the state, and the director shall accept or reject the name. However, the approval of a trust company name by the director may not supersede any person's rights pursuant to state or federal trademark law. The articles, in addition to any other information required by law, shall state: (1) That the corporation or limited liability company is formed for the purpose of engaging in the trust company business; and (2) The period for which such corporation or limited liability company is organized, not exceeding twenty years which may be perpetual. The articles may contain any other provisions as are consistent with law. The articles shall be subscribed by one or more of the organizers of the proposed trust company and shall be acknowledged by them. The full amount of the capital required by \u00a7 51A-6A-19 shall be subscribed before the articles are filed. Section 39. That \u00a7 51A-6A-8 be amended to read as follows: 51A-6A-8. Within one year prior Prior to the expiration of the period for which it was incorporated or organized a trust company may, with the approval of at least a majority of the capital stock or ownership units of such trust company, amend its articles to extend its existence for an additional period, not to exceed twenty years which may be perpetual. Section 40. That \u00a7 55-1-20 be amended to read as follows: 55-1-20. Subject to the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 55-1-21 and 55-1-22, a trust may be performed if the trust is for a specific lawful noncharitable purpose or for lawful noncharitable purposes to be selected by the trustee. Neither the common law rule against perpetuities nor any common law rule limiting the duration of noncharitable purpose trusts is in force in this state. Section 41. That \u00a7 55-1-23 be repealed. 55-1-23. Nothing in \u00a7\u00a7 55-1-20 to 55-1-22, inclusive, may be construed to reinstate the rule against perpetuities in South Dakota as to any trust except trusts specifically defined in \u00a7\u00a7 55-1-20 to 55-1-22, inclusive, as honorary trusts or trusts for the care of specific animals."}, {"bill_id": 2414, "bill_version_id": 16819, "bill_version": "House Judiciary Engrossed", "bill_version_date": "2011-02-14T14:22:40.473-06:00", "bill_text": "FOR AN ACT ENTITLED, An Act to revise various trust provisions. BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 55-1B-2 be amended to read as follows: 55-1B-2. An excluded fiduciary is not liable, either individually or as a fiduciary, for any of the following: (1) Any loss that results from compliance with a direction of the trust advisor, custodial account owner, or authorized designee of a custodial account owner; (2) Any loss that results from a failure to take any action proposed by an excluded fiduciary that requires a prior authorization of the trust advisor if that excluded fiduciary timely sought but failed to obtain that authorization; (3) Any loss that results from any action or inaction, except for gross negligence or willful misconduct, when an excluded fiduciary is required, pursuant to the trust agreement or any other reason, to assume the role of trust advisor, trust protector, investment trust advisor, or distribution trust advisor. Any excluded fiduciary is also relieved from any obligation to perform investment or suitability reviews, inquiries, or investigations or to make recommendations or evaluations with respect to any investments to the extent the trust advisor, custodial account owner, or authorized designee of a custodial account owner had authority to direct the acquisition, disposition, or retention of any such investment. If the excluded fiduciary offers such communication to the trust advisor, trust protector, investment trust advisor, or distribution trust advisor or any investment person selected by the investment trust advisor, such action may not be deemed to constitute an undertaking by the excluded fiduciary to monitor or otherwise participate in actions within the scope of the advisor's authority or to constitute any duty to do so. Any excluded fiduciary is also relieved of any duty to communicate with or warn or apprise any beneficiary or third party concerning instances in which the excluded fiduciary would or might have exercised the excluded fiduciary's own discretion in a manner different from the manner directed by the trust advisor, trust protector, investment trust advisor, or distribution trust advisor. Absent clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, the actions of the excluded fiduciary pertaining to matters within the scope of authority of the trust advisor, trust protector, investment trust advisor, or distribution trust advisor (such as confirming that the advisor's directions have been carried out and recording and reporting actions taken at the advisor's direction) shall be presumed to be administrative actions taken by the excluded fiduciary solely to allow the excluded fiduciary to perform those duties assigned to the excluded fiduciary under the governing instrument, and such administrative actions may not be deemed to constitute an undertaking by the excluded fiduciary to monitor or otherwise participate in actions within the scope of authority of the trust advisor, trust protector, investment trust advisor, or distribution trust advisor. Nothing in subdivision (2) imposes an obligation or liability with respect to a custodian of a custodial account. Section 2. That \u00a7 55-5-16 be amended to read as follows: 55-5-16. A trustee has a duty to personally perform the responsibilities of the trusteeship except as a prudent person might delegate those responsibilities to others. In deciding whether, to whom, and in what manner to delegate fiduciary authority in the administration of a trust, and thereafter in monitoring agents, the trustee may seek the prior approval for the delegation from all known beneficiaries of the trust or from the court. If such approval is given in writing by all known beneficiaries or by the court, the trustee is not liable for the acts of the person to whom the authority is delegated except in the cases of gross willful misconduct or gross negligence by the delegating trustee in the selection or monitoring of the agent.

That chapter 55-1B be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Any governing instrument providing for a trust advisor or trust protector may also provide such trust advisor or trust protector with some, none, or all of the rights, powers, privileges, benefits, immunities, or authorities available to a trustee under South Dakota law or under the governing instrument. Unless the governing instrument provides otherwise, a trust advisor or trust protector has no greater liability to any person than would a trustee holding or benefiting from the rights, powers, privileges, benefits, immunities, or authority provided or allowed by the governing instrument to such trust advisor or trust protector.

The governing documents of any such excluded entity shall limit its authorized activities to the functions permitted to a trust protector, investment trust advisor, or distribution trust advisor pursuant to chapter 55-1B and limit the performance of those functions with respect to a specifically named trust or family of trusts. An entity complying with this section shall notify the director of its existence, capacity to act, and the name of the trustee for the trust or family of trusts. Section 8. That \u00a7 55-2-13 be amended to read as follows: 55-2-13. For purposes of this section, the term, qualified beneficiary, means a beneficiary that is an entity then in existence or an individual who is twenty-one years of age or older and who, on the date the beneficiary's qualification is determined: (1) Is a distributee or permissible distributee of trust income or principal; (2) Would be a distributee or permissible distributee of trust income or principal if the interests of the distributees terminated on that date; or (3) Would be a distributee or permissible distributee of trust income or principal if the trust terminated on that date. However, if the distributee is then unknown because a person holds a power to change the distributee, the trustee shall give notice only to the holder of the power. Except as otherwise provided by the terms of a revocable trust, a trustee has no duty to notify the qualified beneficiaries of the trust's existence. Except as otherwise provided by the terms of an irrevocable trust or otherwise directed in writing by the settlor, distribution trust advisor, or trust protector, the trustee shall, within sixty days after the trustee has accepted trusteeship of the trust, or within sixty days after the date the trustee acquires knowledge that a formerly revocable trust has become irrevocable, notify the qualified beneficiaries of the trust's existence and of the right of the beneficiary to request a copy of the trust instrument pertaining to the beneficiary's interest in the trust. Subject to the previous provision Except as otherwise provided by the terms of an irrevocable trust or otherwise directed in writing by the settlor, trust advisor, or trust protector, a trustee of an irrevocable trust: (1) Upon request of a qualified beneficiary, shall promptly furnish to the qualified beneficiary a copy of the trust instrument; (2) If notification of the trust has not been accomplished pursuant to this section within sixty days after accepting a trusteeship, shall notify the qualified beneficiaries of the acceptance and of the trustee's name, address, and telephone number; (3) Shall promptly respond to a qualified beneficiary's request for information related to the administration of the trust, unless the request is unreasonable under the circumstances. The settlor, trust advisor, or trust protector, may, by the terms of the governing instrument, or in writing delivered to the trustee, expand, restrict, eliminate, or otherwise modify the rights of beneficiaries to information relating to a trust.

For trusts created before July 1, 2002, a trustee has no duty at common law or otherwise to notify a qualified beneficiary of the trust's existence unless otherwise directed by the settlor.

A beneficial interest specifically excludes a power of appointment or a power reserved by the settlor; (2) \"Beneficiary,\" a person that has a present or future beneficial interest in a trust, vested or contingent. The holder of a power of appointment is not a beneficiary; (3) \"Distribution beneficiary,\" a beneficiary who is an eligible distributee or permissible distributee of trust income or principal; (4) \"Distribution interest,\" a distribution interest held by a distribution beneficiary. A distribution interest may be a current distribution interest or a future distribution interest. A distribution interest may be classified as a mandatory interest, a support interest, or a discretionary interest; (5) \"Power of appointment,\" an inter-vivos or testamentary power to direct the disposition of trust property, other than a distribution decision by a trustee to a beneficiary.

Section 32. That chapter 55-1 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: A withdrawal power allows a beneficiary a right to withdraw some part of the trust income or principal.

That \u00a7 55-1-31 be amended to read as follows: 55-1-31. Unless otherwise provided in the trust, if the settlor's spouse is named as beneficiary, the settlor's spouse is still living, and the trust is classified as a support trust, then the trustee shall consider the beneficiary's resources of the settlor's spouse, including the settlor's obligation of support, prior to making a distribution. In all other cases, unless otherwise provided in the trust, the trustee need not consider the beneficiary's resources in determining whether a distribution should be made. Section 34. That \u00a7 55-1-35 be amended to read as follows: 55-1-35. A declaration in a trust that the interest of a beneficiary shall be held subject to a spendthrift trust is sufficient to restrain voluntary or involuntary alienation of a beneficial interest by a beneficiary to the maximum extent provided by law. Regardless of whether a beneficiary has any outstanding creditor, a trustee of a spendthrift trust may directly pay any expense on behalf of such beneficiary and may exhaust the income and principal of the trust for the benefit of such beneficiary. No trustee is liable to any creditor for paying the expenses of a beneficiary of a spendthrift trust. Section 35. That \u00a7 55-1-36 be amended to read as follows: 55-1-36. If a settlor is also a beneficiary of the trust, and the transfer is a qualified transfer under chapter 55-16, the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 55-1-24 to 55-1-43, inclusive, also apply. Conversely, if the settlor is a beneficiary of the trust and the transfer is not a qualified transfer under chapter 55-16, a provision restraining the voluntary or involuntary transfer of the settlor's beneficial interest does not prevent the settlor's creditors from satisfying claims from the settlor's interest in the trust estate, unless the transfer specifically references and is qualified as a transfer under chapter 55-16. However, regardless of whether the transfer is a qualified transfer under chapter 55-16, a settlor's creditors may not satisfy claims from either assets of the trust because of the existence of a discretionary power granted to the trustee by the terms of the trust instrument creating the trust, or any other provisions of law, to pay directly to the taxing authorities or to reimburse the settlor for any tax on trust income or principal which is payable by the settlor under the law imposing such tax; or reimbursements made to the settlor or direct tax payments made to a taxing authority for the settlor's benefit for any tax or trust income or principal which is payable by the trustor under the law imposing such tax. Section 36. That chapter 55-1 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no action of any kind, including an action to enforce a judgement entered by a court or other body having adjudicative authority, may be brought at law or in equity for an attachment or other provisional remedy against property that is the subject of a South Dakota trust or for avoidance of a transfer to a South Dakota trust unless the settlor's transfer of property was made with the intent to defraud that specific creditor. Section 37. That chapter 55-1 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: A cause of action or claim for relief with respect to a fraudulent transfer of a settlor's assets pursuant to \u00a7 55-1-44 is extinguished unless the action under \u00a7 55-1-44 is brought by a creditor of the settlor who meets one of the following requirements: (1) Is a creditor of the settlor before the settlor's assets are transferred to the trust, and the action under \u00a7 55-1-44 is brought within the later of: (a) Three years after the transfer is made; or (b) One year after the transfer is or reasonably could have been discovered by the creditor if the creditor: (i) Can demonstrate that the creditor asserted a specific claim against the settlor before the transfer; or (ii) Files another action, other than an action under \u00a755-1-44, against the settlor that asserts a claim based on an act or omission of the settlor that occurred before the transfer, and the action described in this subsection is filed within three years after the transfer; or (2) Becomes a creditor subsequent to the transfer into trust, and the action under \u00a7 55-1-44 is brought within three years after the transfer is made. Section 38. That \u00a7 51A-6A-7 be amended to read as follows: 51A-6A-7. Any three or more persons may organize a trust company and make and file articles as provided by the laws of this state. No trust company may be organized or incorporated to engage in business as such until the articles have been submitted and approved in accordance with \u00a7 51A-6A-4. The name selected for the trust company may not be the name of any other trust company doing business in the state, and the director shall accept or reject the name. However, the approval of a trust company name by the director may not supersede any person's rights pursuant to state or federal trademark law. The articles, in addition to any other information required by law, shall state: (1) That the corporation or limited liability company is formed for the purpose of engaging in the trust company business; and (2) The period for which such corporation or limited liability company is organized, not exceeding twenty years which may be perpetual. The articles may contain any other provisions as are consistent with law. The articles shall be subscribed by one or more of the organizers of the proposed trust company and shall be acknowledged by them. The full amount of the capital required by \u00a7 51A-6A-19 shall be subscribed before the articles are filed. Section 39. That \u00a7 51A-6A-8 be amended to read as follows: 51A-6A-8. Within one year prior Prior to the expiration of the period for which it was incorporated or organized a trust company may, with the approval of at least a majority of the capital stock or ownership units of such trust company, amend its articles to extend its existence for an additional period, not to exceed twenty years which may be perpetual. Section 40. That \u00a7 55-1-20 be amended to read as follows: 55-1-20. Subject to the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 55-1-21 and 55-1-22, a trust may be performed if the trust is for a specific lawful noncharitable purpose or for lawful noncharitable purposes to be selected by the trustee. Neither the common law rule against perpetuities nor any common law rule limiting the duration of noncharitable purpose trusts is in force in this state. Section 41. That \u00a7 55-1-23 be repealed. 55-1-23. Nothing in \u00a7\u00a7 55-1-20 to 55-1-22, inclusive, may be construed to reinstate the rule against perpetuities in South Dakota as to any trust except trusts specifically defined in \u00a7\u00a7 55-1-20 to 55-1-22, inclusive, as honorary trusts or trusts for the care of specific animals. Section 42. That \u00a7 10-40A-11 be amended to read as follows: 10-40A-11. A will or, trust, or other instrument of a decedent who dies after December 31, 2009, and before January 1, 2011, that contains a formula referring to the unified credit, estate tax exemption, applicable exemption amount, applicable credit amount, applicable exclusion amount, generation-skipping transfer tax exemption, GST exemption, marital deduction, maximum marital deduction, unlimited marital deduction, inclusion ratio, applicable fraction, or any section of the Internal Revenue Code relating to the federal estate tax or generation-skipping transfer tax, or that measures a share of an estate or trust based on the amount that can pass free of federal estate taxes or the amount that can pass free of federal generation-skipping transfer taxes, or that is otherwise based on a similar provision of federal estate tax or generation-skipping transfer tax law, shall be deemed to refer to the federal estate tax and generation-skipping transfer tax laws as they applied with respect to estates of decedents dying on December 31, 2009 in 2010 regardless of whether the decedent's personal representative or other fiduciary elects not to have the estate tax apply with respect to the estate. This provision does not apply with respect to a will or, trust, or other instrument that is executed or amended after December 31, 2009, or that manifests an intent that a contrary rule applies if the decedent dies on a date on which there is no then-applicable federal estate or generation-skipping transfer tax. If the federal estate or generation-skipping transfer tax becomes effective before that date, the reference to January 1, 2011, in this section refers instead to the first date on which such tax becomes legally effective. Section 43. That chapter 10-40A be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: The personal representative, trustee, other fiduciary, or any affected beneficiary under the will, trust, or other instrument may bring a proceeding to determine whether the decedent intended that the will, trust, or other instrument be construed in a manner other than as provided in \u00a7 10-40A-11. Any proceeding pursuant to \u00a7 10-40A-11 and sections 43 and 44 of this Act shall be commenced prior to January 1, 2012. In such a proceeding, the court may consider extrinsic evidence that contradicts the plain meaning of the will, trust, or other instrument. The court has the power to modify a provision of a will, trust, or other instrument that refers to the federal estate tax or generation skipping transfer tax laws as described in \u00a7 10-40A-11 to conform the terms to the decedent's intention or achieve the decedent's tax objectives in a manner that is not contrary to the decedent's probable intention. The court may provide that its decision, including any decision to modify a provision of a will, trust, or other instrument shall be effective as of the date of the decedent's death. Any person who commences a proceeding pursuant to \u00a7 10-40A-11 and section 43 and 44 of this Act has the burden of proof, by clear and convincing evidence, and persuasion in establishing the decedent's intention that the will, trust, or other instrument be construed in a manner other than as provided in \u00a7 10-40A-11. Section 44. That chapter 10-40A be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: For purposes of \u00a7 10-40A-11, any interested person may enter into a binding agreement to determine whether the decedent intended that the will, trust, or other instrument shall be construed in a manner other than as provided in \u00a7 10-40A-11, and to conform the terms of the will, trust, or other instrument to the decedent's intention without court approval as provided in section 43 of this Act. Any interested person may petition the court to approve the agreement or to determine whether all interested persons are parties to the agreement, either in person or by adequate representation where permitted by law, and whether the agreement contains terms the court could have properly approved. In the case of a trust, the agreement may be by nonjudicial settlement agreement. For the purposes of this section, an interested person means any person whose consent is required in order to achieve a binding settlement were the settlement to be approved by the court. Section 45. That \u00a7 10-40A-13 be amended to read as follows: 10-40A-13. The provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 10-40A-11 and 10-40A-12 and sections 43 and 44 of this Act apply to decedents dying after December 31, 2009, and before January 1, 2011."}, {"bill_id": 2414,
