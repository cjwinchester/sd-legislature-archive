Each person , over eighteen years of age, hired by a school district who has regularly scheduled, unsupervised, individual contact with children shall submit to a criminal background investigation, by means of fingerprint checks by the Division of Criminal Investigation and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The school district shall submit completed fingerprint cards to the Division of Criminal Investigation before the prospective new employee enters into service. If no disqualifying record is identified at the state level, the fingerprints shall be forwarded by the Division of Criminal Investigation to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for a national criminal history record check. Any person whose employment is subject to the requirements of this section may enter into service on a temporary basis pending receipt of results of the criminal background investigation. The employing school district may, without liability, withdraw its offer of employment or terminate the temporary employment without notice if the report reveals a disqualifying record. Any person whose employment is subject to the requirements of this section shall pay any fees charged for the criminal record check. However, the school board or governing body may reimburse the person for the fees. Any person hired to officiate, judge, adjudicate, or referee an event conducted under the authority of the South Dakota High School Activities Association is not required to submit to a criminal background investigation as required in this section. Section 2. That chapter 13-10 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Each school district shall require any organization or person providing services to the district which involve employees of the service provider having regularly scheduled, individual, unsupervised contact with children to subject such employee to the same criminal background investigation as provided for in \u00a7 13-10-12.
