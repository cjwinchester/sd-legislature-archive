Section 14. The director may, after consultation with the secretary, promulgate rules pursuant to chapter 1-26 to carry out the provisions of the Act.

Section 16. Nothing in this Act applies to health carrier's plans that do not directly or indirectly engage in utilization review or to dental only, vision only, accident only, school accident, travel, or specified disease plans or plans that primarily provide a fixed daily, fixed occurrence, or fixed per procedure benefit without regard to expenses incurred."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 14825, "action_date": "1999-02-01T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 82147, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/82147.pdf", "status_text": "First read in Senate and referred to", "journal_page": 278, "committee_id_action": 629, "committee_id_assigned": 611, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 14825, "action_date": "1999-02-08T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 82086, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/82086.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 611, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 14825, "action_date": "1999-02-08T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 82086, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/82086.pdf", "status_text": "Tabled", "journal_page": 364, "committee_id_action": 611, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 40997, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [2224, 2270, 2246, 2259, 2299, 2283, 2241], "Excused": [2292, 2230]}}, {"bill_id": 14825, "action_date": "1999-02-08T19:30:00-06:00", "document_id": 82087, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/82087.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 611, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}]}
