Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of South Dakota: Section 1. The excise tax collected under chapter 10-46A from projects on Ellsworth Air Force Base must be deposited into a special revenue fund. Moneys in the special revenue fund are continuously appropriated for the purpose of providing grants for the construction of an elementary school within the Douglas School District. Beginning on July 1, 2025, and annually on July first thereafter, the Department of Revenue must provide a grant for the total amount then in the special revenue fund to the Douglas School District for the construction of an elementary school within the district. Upon the department granting fifteen million dollars pursuant to this Act, all moneys remaining in the special revenue fund must be reverted to the general fund. Once the moneys are reverted, this section expires. Section 2. Whereas, this Act is necessary for the support of the state government and its existing public institutions, an emergency is hereby declared to exist, and this Act shall be in full force and effect from and after its passage and approval."}], "amendments": [{"bill_id": 25179, "document_id": 264512, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/264512.pdf", "legislator_profile_id": 4527, "document_id_instructions": 264513, "document_id_instructions_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/264513.pdf"}], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 25179, "action_date": "2024-01-30T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 263279, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/263279.pdf", "status_text": "First Reading House", "journal_page": 198, "committee_id_action": 1197, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 25179, "action_date": "2024-01-31T14:30:00-06:00", "document_id": 263721, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/263721.pdf", "status_text": "Referred to", "journal_page": 216, "committee_id_action": 1197, "committee_id_assigned": 1203, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 25179, "action_date": "2024-02-05T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 264412, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/264412.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 1, "committee_id_action": 1203, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}]}
