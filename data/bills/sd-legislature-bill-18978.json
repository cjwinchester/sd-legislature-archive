BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 34A-15-6 be amended to read as follows: 34A-15-6. Sections 34A-15-3 to 34A-15-5, inclusive, do not affect any liability expressly created under federal or state health or environmental statutes, regulations, rules, permits, or orders. A lender-owner is not liable for environmental cleanup or remediation costs unless: (1) The lender-owner, its employees, or agents directly cause an immediate release or directly exacerbate a release of the regulated substances on or from the property; or (2) The lender-owner, its employees, or agents knowingly and willfully compelled the borrower to: (a) Perform an action that caused an immediate release of regulated substances in excess of reportable quantities; or (b) Violate any environmental statute or regulation. Liability pursuant to this section is limited to the cost for a response action or remediation that is directly attributable to the lender-owner's activities set forth in subdivisions (1) and (2) of this section. Liability arises only if the lender-owner's actions were the proximate and efficient cause of the release or violation. Ownership or control of the property pursuant to a security interest during or after foreclosure does not by itself trigger liability. No lender-owner is liable for any response action or remediation if the response action or remediation arises solely from a release of regulated substances in excess of reportable quantities that occurred before or commences before and continues after foreclosure. However, the lender-owner is responsible for the portion of the response action or remediation that is directly attributable to the lender-owner's exacerbation of a release. A release of regulated substances in excess of reportable quantities discovered in the course of conducting environmental due diligence is presumed to be a prior or continuing release on the property."}, {"bill_id": 18978, "bill_version_id": 100619, "bill_version": "House Judiciary Engrossed", "bill_version_date": "2004-02-04T13:58:32-06:00", "bill_text": "FOR AN ACT ENTITLED, An Act to provide a limitation of lender environmental liability for cleanup and remediation costs if providing financing for a site participating in a brownfields revitalization and economic development program.
