Nothing in this chapter limits the powers of the commission, or precludes the pursuit of any other administrative, civil, injunctive, or criminal remedies by the commission or any other person. Administrative remedies need not be exhausted in order to proceed under this chapter. The remedies provided by this chapter are in addition to those provided under existing statutory or common law.
