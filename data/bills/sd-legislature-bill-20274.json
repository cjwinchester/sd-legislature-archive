BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 12-16-16 be amended to read as follows: 12-16-16. The county auditor shall publish , in each official newspaper of the county, facsimiles of the official ballots of each election in which the voters of the entire county participate. The facsimile shall be published once in each legal newspaper in the calendar week prior to each election. The newspaper shall receive for the publications, compensation at the same rate as the general display rate for the newspaper. The published facsimile may be reduced in size proportionately up to fifty percent but in no case may the ballot wording be in a type less than eight point. If a portion of a candidate ballot is not voted on in the entire county, a facsimile of that portion of the ballot may be published simultaneously but separate from the candidate ballot and shall contain a description of who will vote on that portion of the ballot. If at least fifty percent of a ballot is blank, the blank portion does not need to be printed. Section 2. That chapter 12-16 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: This section applies when a facsimile ballot is published. The newspaper shall be compensated for publication of the facsimile ballot at the same rate as the general display rate or the qualifying contract rate, whichever is less, for the newspaper. The published facsimile may be reduced in size proportionately up to fifty percent but in no case may the ballot wording be in a type less than eight point.
