Section 13. That \u00a7 10-6-31.3 be AMENDED: 10-6-31.3. Criteria for classification of land as agricultural.

Agricultural land also includes woodland, wasteland, and pasture land, but only if the land is held and operated in conjunction with agricultural land and is under the same ownership. In addition, to be classified as agricultural land for tax purposes, the land must meet one of the following criteria: (1) In three of the previous five years, a gross income is derived from the pursuit of agriculture from the land that is at least ten percent of the taxable valuation of the bare land assessed as agricultural property, excluding any improvements. If there is a crop share arrangement or cash rent agreement, the gross income from the land of both the landlord and tenant must be combined and used to meet this requirement. Alternatively, at least two thousand five hundred dollars of the owner's gross income is annually derived from the pursuit of agriculture; or (2) The land consists of not less than twenty acres of unplatted land or is a part of a management unit of not less than eighty acres of unplatted land. The same acreage specifications apply to platted land, excluding land platted as a subdivision, that is in an unincorporated area. However, the board of county commissioners may increase the minimum acre requirement up to one hundred sixty acres. For the purposes of this section, the term, management unit, means any two or more parcels of land, whether adjoining or not, under common ownership located within this state and managed and operated as a unit for one or more of the principal uses listed in this section. No parcel of land within a management unit may be more than twenty air miles from the nearest other parcel within the management unit.

For the purposes of this section, the measurement along a river or stream begins at the top of the bank or where the upland or terrestrial vegetation begins, whichever is closer to the water channel, and extends landward from the beginning measuring point. The measurement along a lake begins where upland or terrestrial vegetation begins and extends landward from the beginning measuring point. A riparian buffer strip may vary along the riparian area if the strip is at least fifty to one hundred twenty feet in width and is mapped to calculate the taxable area involved; (3) The perennial vegetation is not harvested or mowed before July tenth. However, a minimum of four inches of vegetative cover shall be maintained at all times; (4) The perennial vegetation is not grazed during the months of May to September, inclusive; and (5) The landowner files a verified application with the director of equalization of the county where the agricultural property is located, verifying that the criteria of this section has been met. The landowner shall include in the application a legal description of the parcel where the riparian buffer strip is located, all necessary documentation including maps and acre totals, and any other information required by the director to determine eligibility. The application must be filed annually with the director before October sixteenth.
