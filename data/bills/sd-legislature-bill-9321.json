If it is determined by the governing body to be necessary or expedient for any public body to issue its bonds the governing body at a regular meeting thereof or a special meeting duly called may by resolution or ordinance declare the necessity thereof of the issuance of bonds and may submit the question of the issuance of bonds to the voters of the public body. In any odd-numbered year the question of the issuance of bonds may be submitted to the voters at any annual election or at a special election called for that purpose. In any even-numbered year, the question may only be submitted to the voters at the primary or general election. The resolution or ordinance shall set forth clearly the purpose for which the bonds are to be issued and the maximum amount of the bonds. The resolution or ordinance may also include the maximum rate of interest which they the bonds draw, and the maximum time within which they the bonds shall become due and payable or other matters the governing body determines relevant to the bond issue."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 9321, "action_date": "2019-01-30T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 52893, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/52893.pdf", "status_text": "First read in Senate and referred to", "journal_page": 228, "committee_id_action": 409, "committee_id_assigned": 411, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 9321, "action_date": "2019-02-11T08:30:00-06:00", "document_id": 53311, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/53311.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 411, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 9321, "action_date": "2019-02-11T08:30:00-06:00", "document_id": 53402, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/53402.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 411, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "F", "vote": {"vote_id": 28063, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [1582, 1606, 1426, 1565], "Yea": [1595, 1608], "Excused": [1442]}}, {"bill_id": 9321, "action_date": "2019-02-11T08:30:00-06:00", "document_id": 53402, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/53402.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to the 41st legislative day", "journal_page": 326, "committee_id_action": 411, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 28070, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [1582, 1606, 1426, 1565], "Nay": [1595, 1608], "Excused": [1442]}}]}
