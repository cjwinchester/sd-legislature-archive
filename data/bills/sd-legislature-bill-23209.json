Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of South Dakota: Section 1. That chapter 2-6 be amended with a NEW SECTION: The State-Tribal Relations Committee may examine all records and summon witnesses by request or by issuing a subpoena whenever a record or witness is necessary for the committee to fulfill its responsibility to study the relationship between the state and its political subdivisions and the tribes and their tribal governments. The committee may issue a subpoena for a person, documents, or both, and use the procedure provided in chapter 21-34 to enforce its subpoena when the subject of the subpoena refuses to comply with the command to appear and testify before the committee. The committee may not issue a subpoena until the decision to issue the subpoena is ratified by the Executive Board of the Legislative Research Council. Section 2. That chapter 2-6 be amended with a NEW SECTION: Before a subpoena may issue from the State-Tribal Relations Committee, the committee must affirmatively find: (1) A legislative purpose exists pursuant to \u00a7 2-6-23 and section 1 of this Act; (2) The subpoenaed person or documents are relevant and material to accomplish the legislative purpose; and (3) The information sought is not otherwise practically available. It is not a legislative purpose to subpoena a person or documents to collect information that may be used for a criminal proceeding or to legislatively determine guilt or inflict punishment upon an identifiable person."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 23209, "action_date": "2022-01-26T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 229686, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/229686.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 127, "committee_id_action": 1008, "committee_id_assigned": 1016, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 23209, "action_date": "2022-02-04T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 232301, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/232301.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 1016, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 23209, "action_date": "2022-02-04T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 232302, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/232302.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to the 41st legislative day", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 1016, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 72564, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [3912, 3916, 3923, 3941, 3942, 3946, 3954, 3965, 3995, 4011, 3957], "Excused": [3989, 3982]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/23209"}
