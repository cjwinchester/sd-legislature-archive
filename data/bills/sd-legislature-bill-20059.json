BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That chapter 7-8 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Notwithstanding the provisions of \u00a7 7-8-10, if a majority of the board of county commissioners of any county become aware of facts that call into question whether the county's commissioner districts comply with state or federal law, the board of county commissioners may request that the Governor and secretary of state grant the board permission to revise the boundaries of the county commissioner districts. Section 2. That chapter 7-8 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: The Governor and secretary of state, after consultation with the board of county commissioners, may jointly issue to the board of county commissioners a written order affirming that good cause exists for redistricting and authorizing the board of county commissioners to revise the county's commission districts based on information from the last preceding federal decennial census. Section 3. That chapter 7-8 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: The board of county commissioners may, within one hundred eighty days of receipt of such written order, redistrict the county's commission districts once to avoid any perceived or potential violation of state or federal law. The commissioners may change the boundaries of the commissioner districts in order that each district shall be as regular and compact in form as practicable and shall redistrict the county so that each commission district contains an appropriate number of residents, as determined by the last preceding federal decennial census; or the board of county commissioners may, at its discretion, choose to have all of its commissioners run at large. Such redistricting shall occur only after giving notice by publication for at least one week in the official newspapers of the county. Section 4. Whereas, this Act is necessary for the support of the state government and its existing public institutions, an emergency is hereby declared to exist, and this Act shall be in full force and effect from and after its passage and approval."}, {"bill_id": 20059, "bill_version_id": 105723, "bill_version": "Enrolled", "bill_version_date": "2005-03-02T09:09:40-06:00", "bill_text": ""}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 20059, "action_date": "2005-02-23T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 105301, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/105301.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass,", "journal_page": 611, "committee_id_action": 860, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 62093, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [3155, 3158, 3159, 3160, 3161, 3162, 3164, 3167, 3169, 3170, 3171, 3172, 3174, 3175, 3176, 3177, 3178, 3181, 3182, 3183, 3184, 3187, 3188, 3189, 3190, 3191, 3192, 3195, 3196, 3197, 3199, 3203, 3206, 3207, 3208, 3209, 3211, 3213, 3216, 3218, 3220, 3222, 3223, 3225, 3226, 3227, 3229, 3230, 3231, 3232, 3233, 3234, 3235, 3237, 3238, 3240, 3243, 3244, 3245, 3246, 3248, 3249, 3251, 3252, 3253, 3254, 3255, 3215], "Excused": [3156, 3194]}}, {"bill_id": 20059, "action_date": "2005-02-24T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 105389, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/105389.pdf", "status_text": "First read in Senate and referred to", "journal_page": 630, "committee_id_action": 861, "committee_id_assigned": 843, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 20059, "action_date": "2005-02-28T08:30:00-06:00", "document_id": 105521, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/105521.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 843, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 20059, "action_date": "2005-02-28T08:30:00-06:00", "document_id": 105521, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/105521.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass,", "journal_page": 661, "committee_id_action": 843, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 60635, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [3150, 3212, 3214, 3217, 3224, 3236, 3241, 3205, 3154]}}, {"bill_id": 20059, "action_date": "2005-03-01T11:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 105704, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/105704.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass,", "journal_page": 717, "committee_id_action": 861, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 60725, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [3150, 3151, 3152, 3153, 3154, 3157, 3163, 3165, 3166, 3168, 3173, 3179, 3180, 3185, 3198, 3201, 3202, 3210, 3212, 3214, 3217, 3219, 3224, 3236, 3239, 3241, 3242], "Nay": [3186, 3193, 3204, 3221, 3228, 3247], "Excused": [3200, 3205]}}, {"bill_id": 20059, "action_date": "2005-03-02T11:30:00-06:00", "document_id": 105772, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/105772.pdf", "status_text": "Signed by Speaker", "journal_page": 760, "committee_id_action": 860, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 20059, "action_date": "2005-03-03T09:30:00-06:00", "document_id": 105846, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/105846.pdf", "status_text": "Signed by President", "journal_page": 760, "committee_id_action": 861, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 20059, "action_date": "2005-03-03T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 105859, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/105859.pdf", "status_text": "Delivered to the Governor", "journal_page": 780, "committee_id_action": 860, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 20059, "action_date": "2005-03-22T11:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 105977, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/105977.pdf", "status_text": "Signed by Governor", "journal_page": 826, "committee_id_action": 860, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}], "session_law": 2958, "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/20059"}
