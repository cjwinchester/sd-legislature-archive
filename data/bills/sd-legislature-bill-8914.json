WHEREAS, the Charter of the United Nations recognizes the continued validity of rights granted by the League of Nations in 1922 to states or peoples that already existed under international instruments and this action was affirmed by both Houses of the United States Congress; and WHEREAS, the State of Israel declared its independence and statehood on May 14, 1948, and the United States immediately recognized the State of Israel's independence and was the first country to do so; and WHEREAS, the establishment of the State of Israel as a modern homeland for the Jewish people followed the extermination of more than six million European Jews during the early to mid-twentieth century; and WHEREAS, the Israeli people have built one of the world's most dynamic cultural, economic, agricultural, and intellectual societies while confronting constant terrorism, the immense pressures of imminent war, constant missile barrages, economic boycotts, and ostracism from much of the international community; and WHEREAS, in spite of these adversities, the State of Israel has established a strong democratic political system that guarantees its people freedom of speech, freedom of the press, fair and open elections, and respect for the rule of law for Jews and Arabs alike; and WHEREAS, at great financial and social cost, the State of Israel has welcomed millions of immigrants from around the world and has made great strides in assimilating these immigrants into Israeli life and society; and WHEREAS, the United States and the citizens of South Dakota share democratic values, common strategic interests, bonds of friendship, and mutual respect with the State of Israel; and WHEREAS, the four thousand year history of the Jewish people and their land is documented in great detail in the Jewish Torah and throughout the Christian Bible: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the Senate of the Ninety-Third Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the House of Representatives concurring therein, that the Legislature reaffirms the strong bonds that connect the people of South Dakota and the United States to the people and State of Israel; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, the Legislature expresses its outrage regarding all terrorist acts perpetrated against the Israeli people, especially the bold and blatant declaration by the enemies of the State of Israel to destroy their small country, the same enemies who declare they will destroy the United States; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, the Legislature expresses strong support and a steadfast commitment to the security, welfare and survival of the sovereign State of Israel and recognizes its right to secure its borders and to act in self-defense to protect its citizens from acts of terrorism;
