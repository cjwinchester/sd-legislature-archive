The board may not order such commitment unless it determines that the proposed facility is able to provide adequate and appropriate treatment and the treatment is likely to be beneficial. Section 19.

However, no person may be detained at the program's or the physician's office for more than one hour unless the person consents, or may be physically coerced or required to take prescribed medications unless the outpatient commitment or treatment order contains a specific authorization for the nonconsensual delivery of prescribed medication, pursuant to \u00a7 27A-12-3.15.
