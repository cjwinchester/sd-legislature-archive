BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 41-6-75 be amended to read as follows: 41-6-75. Any person hunting, fishing , or trapping during any period when that privilege has been revoked pursuant to \u00a7 41-6-74 or who purchases or attempts to purchase a license to which he that person is not entitled while under revocation is guilty of a Class 2 Class 1 misdemeanor. Section 2. That \u00a7 41-8-39 be amended to read as follows: 41-8-39. No person shall may intentionally kill or attempt to kill any wild bird or animal from any aircraft while in flight within this state nor shall may any person use any aircraft for the purpose of hunting, taking, concentrating, driving, rallying, stirring up, locating, or spotting for any persons. Any person who, while in flight in an aircraft of any type, kills or attempts to kill any game bird or game animal or uses such aircraft for the purpose of hunting, taking, concentrating, driving, rallying, stirring up, spotting, or locating game birds or game animals for any persons, is guilty of a Class 2 Class 1 misdemeanor. Section 3. That chapter 41-1 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: If a person has taken or is in possession of more than two times the lawful daily or possession limit of a regulated wild animal, the liquidated damages as determined and provided for in \u00a7 \u00a7 41-1-5.1 and 41-1-5.3 to 41-1-5.5, inclusive, shall be doubled. Section 4. That \u00a7 41-1-5.2 be amended to read as follows: 41-1-5.2. The liquidated damages provided for in \u00a7 \u00a7 41-1-5.1 and 41-1-5.3 to 41-1-5.5, inclusive, this chapter and taxable costs may be collected by the Department of Game, Fish and Parks in a civil suit brought by it, in the name of the State of South Dakota, against the person claimed to be liable therefor. Conviction of a criminal offense for the same incident leading to the charges specified in \u00a7 \u00a7 41-1-5.1 and 41-1-5.3 to 41-1-5.5, inclusive, is prima facie evidence of the defendant's civil liability. Failure to obtain conviction on a criminal charge is not a bar to a separate civil action for such liquidated damages. The department, collecting such liquidated damages and taxable costs, shall deposit them in the Department of Game, Fish and Parks fund. Any other public agency or department of the state, collecting liquidated damages and taxable costs, shall remit the moneys collected, less the agreed collection fee, to the state treasurer who shall deposit them in the Department of Game, Fish, and Parks fund. The judgment and liquidated damages may be collected by an agent. Fees to agents authorized to collect on a judgment under this section may not exceed fifty percent of the total amount collected. With approval of the department, agreed collection fees may be deducted from the moneys collected when remitted or may be paid on warrants drawn by the state auditor on itemized vouchers approved by the secretary of game, fish and parks and submitted simultaneously with the moneys collected."}, {"bill_id": 13093, "bill_version_id": 74013, "bill_version": "Enrolled", "bill_version_date":
