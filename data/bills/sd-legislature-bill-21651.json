BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. There is hereby created a special high school district known as the Prairie High School District. The primary purpose of the special high school district is to provide a high school education to students located in rural areas of the state through the use of technology, teachers, and tutors. The Prairie High School District shall meet the following requirements: (1) The special high school district shall educate, primarily through the use of technology, any South Dakota student in grades nine through twelve who chooses to enroll; (2) The special high school district may have no physical boundaries and may not contain any real property subject to ad valorem taxes pursuant to chapter 10-4; and (3) The special high school district shall have attendance centers that are equipped with the technology necessary to provide distance learning as defined in \u00a7 13-33-20 to high school students, and are located in or adjacent to existing public attendance centers that serve students in kindergarten through eighth grade. Section 2. Any student attending an attendance center operated by the Prairie High School District shall be accounted for and identified in the same manner as any other student attending a public school in South Dakota. Section 3. The Prairie High School District is entitled to receive foundation program state aid distributed to school districts in accordance with the provisions of chapter 13-13, and state aid for special education distributed to school districts in accordance with the provisions of chapter 13-37. For the purposes of calculating foundation program state aid pursuant to chapter 13-13, the adjusted average daily membership of the Prairie High School District is equal to its average daily membership. Section 4. The Prairie High School District is not entitled to receive funds from any county general school fund distributed pursuant to \u00a7 13-13-5, the net proceeds of any fines and pecuniary penalties distributed pursuant to \u00a7 23A-27-25, the proceeds from any gross receipts taxes distributed pursuant to \u00a7 10-33-24 or 10-36-10, the proceeds from any bank franchise taxes distributed pursuant to \u00a7 10-43-77, or the net proceeds from any mobile home taxes distributed pursuant to \u00a7 10-9-14. For purposes of distributing funds pursuant to S.D. Const., Art. VIII, Sect. 3, the Prairie High School District is not a public school corporation. Section 5. Notwithstanding the provisions of chapters 13-7 and 13-8, the secretary of education shall appoint the president of the school board of the Prairie High School District, and the president shall appoint at least four, but no more than eight, additional school board members. Section 6. Notwithstanding the provisions of \u00a7 13-36-7, no student enrolled in the Prairie High School District is eligible to participate in any interscholastic activity sponsored by the South Dakota High School Activities Association. Section 7. Since the Prairie High School District may not levy taxes to establish any special funds, the special high school district may use general funds to pay for expenses that in other school districts are paid from the special education fund pursuant to \u00a7 13-37-16 or the capital outlay fund pursuant to \u00a7 13-16-6. Section 8. Except as provided in this Act, the Prairie High School District is subject to all laws under Title 13 and all rules authorized under Title 13 that govern public high schools and school districts in the state.

The South Dakota Board of Education shall promulgate rules, pursuant to chapter 1-26, to define the technological needs of each of the attendance centers, to establish the procedures and timelines for the selection of the school board president and the other school board members, and to establish other policies and procedures necessary to allow the special high school district to fulfill its intended purpose."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 21651, "action_date": "2007-01-30T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 111185, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/111185.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 260, "committee_id_action": 923, "committee_id_assigned": 912, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 21651, "action_date": "2007-02-06T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 111644, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/111644.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 912, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 21651, "action_date": "2007-02-08T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 111835, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/111835.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 912, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 21651, "action_date": "2007-02-13T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 112161, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/112161.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 912, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 21651, "action_date": "2007-02-15T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 112374, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/112374.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 912, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 21651, "action_date": "2007-02-15T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 112374, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/112374.pdf", "status_text": "Hog Housed", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 912, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 21651, "action_date": "2007-02-15T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 112374, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/112374.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass Amended,", "journal_page": 557, "committee_id_action": 912, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 65307, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [3577, 3591, 3604, 3614, 3635, 3643, 3649, 3671, 3674, 3675, 3613], "Nay": [3579, 3587, 3599, 3665]}}, {"bill_id": 21651, "action_date": "2007-02-15T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 112374, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/112374.pdf", "status_text": "Title Amended", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 912, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 21651, "action_date": "2007-02-20T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 112514, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/112514.pdf", "status_text": "Motion to Amend,", "journal_page": 581, "committee_id_action": 923, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 21651, "action_date": "2007-02-20T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 112514, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/112514.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass Amended,", "journal_page": 581, "committee_id_action": 923, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "F", "vote": {"vote_id": 67158, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [3572, 3576, 3579, 3580, 3581, 3582, 3583, 3586, 3590, 3592, 3594, 3597, 3598, 3599, 3605, 3606, 3609, 3611, 3614, 3619, 3624, 3628, 3629, 3631, 3635, 3637, 3638, 3640, 3642, 3645, 3649, 3650, 3651, 3653, 3655, 3660, 3663, 3665, 3666, 3668, 3670, 3671, 3672, 3673, 3676], "Yea": [3577, 3578, 3587, 3588, 3591, 3593, 3600, 3604, 3613, 3616, 3620, 3622, 3632, 3643, 3644, 3646, 3648, 3654, 3656, 3657, 3658, 3662, 3674, 3675, 3584]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/21651"}
