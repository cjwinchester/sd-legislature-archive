(e) Except as otherwise provided in \u00a7 57A-9-320 and 57A-9-321, if a person files a financing statement with respect to a purchase-money security interest before or within 20 days after the debtor receives delivery of the collateral, the security interest takes priority over the rights of a buyer, lessee, or lien creditor which arise between the time the security interest attaches and the time of filing. Section 7. That \u00a7 57A-9-326 be amended to read as follows: 57A-9-326. (a) Subject to subsection (b), a security interest that is created by a new debtor which is in collateral in which the new debtor has or acquires rights and is perfected by a filed financing statement that is effective solely under \u00a7 57A-9-508 in collateral in which a new debtor has or acquires rights would be ineffective to perfect the security interest but for the application of \u00a7 57A-9-508 or \u00a7\u00a7 57A-9-508 and 57A-9-316(i)(1) is subordinate to a security interest in the same collateral which is perfected other than by a filed financing statement that is effective solely under \u00a7 57A-9-508. (b) The other provisions of this part determine the priority among conflicting security interests in the same collateral perfected by filed financing statements that are effective solely under \u00a7 57A-9-508 described in subsection (a). However, if the security agreements to which a new debtor became bound as debtor were not entered into by the same original debtor, the conflicting security interests rank according to priority in time of the new debtor's having become bound.

After receipt of the notification, the account debtor may discharge its obligation by paying the assignee and may not discharge the obligation by paying the assignor.

(c) Subject to subsection (h), if requested by the account debtor, an assignee shall seasonably furnish reasonable proof that the assignment has been made.

(f) Except as otherwise provided in \u00a7\u00a7 57A-2A-303 and 57A-9-407 and subject to subsections (h) and (i), a rule of law, statute, or regulation that prohibits, restricts, or requires the consent of a government, governmental body or official, or account debtor to the assignment or transfer of, or creation of a security interest in, an account or chattel paper is ineffective to the extent that the rule of law, statute, or regulation: (1) Prohibits, restricts, or requires the consent of the government, governmental body or official, or account debtor to the assignment or transfer of, or the creation, attachment, perfection, or enforcement of a security interest in the account or chattel paper; or (2) Provides that the assignment or transfer or the creation, attachment, perfection, or enforcement of the security interest may give rise to a default, breach, right of recoupment, claim, defense, termination, right of termination, or remedy under the account or chattel paper. (g) Subject to subsection (h), an account debtor may not waive or vary its option under subsection (b)(3). (h) This section is subject to law other than this article which establishes a different rule for an account debtor who is an individual and who incurred the obligation primarily for personal, family, or household purposes. (i) This section does not apply to an assignment of a health-care-insurance receivable. (j) This section prevails over any inconsistent statute. Section 9.

(b) Subsection (a) applies to a security interest in a payment intangible or promissory note only if the security interest arises out of a sale of the payment intangible or promissory note, other than a sale pursuant to a disposition under \u00a7 57A-9-610 or an acceptance of collateral under \u00a7 57A-9-620. (c) A rule of law, statute, or regulation that prohibits, restricts, or requires the consent of a government, governmental body or official, person obligated on a promissory note, or account debtor to the assignment or transfer of, or creation of a security interest in, a promissory note, health-care-insurance receivable, or general intangible, including a contract, permit, license, or franchise between an account debtor and a debtor, is ineffective to the extent that the rule of law, statute, or regulation: (1) Would impair the creation, attachment, or perfection of a security interest; or (2) Provides that the assignment or transfer or the creation, attachment, or perfection of the security interest may give rise to a default, breach, right of recoupment, claim, defense, termination, right of termination, or remedy under the promissory note, health-care-insurance receivable, or general intangible.

Section 12. That \u00a7 57A-9-507 be amended to read as follows: 57A-9-507.

(c) If a debtor so changes its the name that a filed financing statement provides for a debtor becomes insufficient as the name of the debtor under \u00a7 57A-9-503(a) so that the financing statement becomes seriously misleading under \u00a7 57A-9-506: (1) The financing statement is effective to perfect a security interest in collateral acquired by the debtor before, or within four months after, the change filed financing statement becomes seriously misleading; and (2) The financing statement is not effective to perfect a security interest in collateral acquired by the debtor more than four months after the change filed financing statement becomes seriously misleading, unless an amendment to the financing statement which renders the financing statement not seriously misleading is filed within four months after the change that event.

Financing statements filed before July 1, 1997, are effective for a period of five years from the date of filing and thereafter for a period of sixty days. The expiration date established by a financing statement filed prior to July 1, 1997, whether or not continued by a continuation statement shall remain in full force and effect and is not diminished by any subsequent amendments to this chapter. (b) Except as otherwise provided in subsections (e), (f), and (g), an initial financing statement filed in connection with a manufactured-home transaction is effective for a period of thirty years after the date of filing if it indicates that it is filed in connection with a manufactured-home transaction. (c) The effectiveness of a filed financing statement lapses on the expiration of the period of its effectiveness unless before the lapse a continuation statement is filed pursuant to subsection (d). Upon lapse, a financing statement ceases to be effective and any security interest or agricultural lien that was perfected by the financing statement becomes unperfected, unless the security interest is perfected otherwise. If the security interest or agricultural lien becomes unperfected upon lapse, it is deemed never to have been perfected as against a purchaser of the collateral for value. (d) A continuation statement may be filed only within six months before the expiration of the five-year period specified in subsection (a) or the thirty-year period specified in subsection (b), whichever is applicable. However, for financing statements filed before July 1, 1997, a continuation statement may be filed within six months before and sixty days after the expiration of the five-year period.

Succeeding continuation statements may be filed in the same manner to continue the effectiveness of the initial financing statement. (f) If a debtor is a transmitting utility and a filed initial financing statement so indicates, the financing statement is effective until a termination statement is filed. (g) A record of a mortgage that is effective as a financing statement filed as a fixture filing under \u00a7 57A-9-502(c) remains effective as a financing statement filed as a fixture filing until the mortgage is released or satisfied of record or its effectiveness otherwise terminates as to the real property. Section 14. That \u00a7 57A-9-516 be amended to read as follows: 57A-9-516.

(g) If this state has issued to an individual more than one driver license of a kind described in subsection (a)(4), the one that was issued most recently is the one to which subsection (a)(4) refers. (h) In this section, the \"name of the settlor or testator\" means: (1) If the settlor is a registered organization, the name of the registered organization indicated on the public organic record filed with or enacted by the registered organization; or (2) In other cases, the name of the settlor or testator indicated in the trust's organic record. Section 12. That \u00a7 57A-9-507 be amended to read as follows: 57A-9-507. (a) A filed financing statement remains effective with respect to collateral that is sold, exchanged, leased, licensed, or otherwise disposed of and in which a security interest or agricultural lien continues, even if the secured party knows of or consents to the disposition. (b) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c) and \u00a7 57A-9-508, a financing statement is not rendered ineffective if, after the financing statement is filed, the information provided in the financing statement becomes seriously misleading under \u00a7 57A-9-506. (c) If a debtor so changes its the name that a filed financing statement provides for a debtor becomes insufficient as the name of the debtor under \u00a7 57A-9-503(a) so that the financing statement becomes seriously misleading under \u00a7 57A-9-506: (1) The financing statement is effective to perfect a security interest in collateral acquired by the debtor before, or within four months after, the change filed financing statement becomes seriously misleading; and (2) The financing statement is not effective to perfect a security interest in collateral acquired by the debtor more than four months after the change filed financing statement becomes seriously misleading, unless an amendment to the financing statement which renders the financing statement not seriously misleading is filed within four months after the change that event. Section 13. That \u00a7 57A-9-515 be amended to read as follows: 57A-9-515. (a) Except as otherwise provided in subsections (b), (e), (f), and (g), a filed financing statement is effective for a period of five years after the date of filing. Financing statements filed before July 1, 1997, are effective for a period of five years from the date of filing and thereafter for a period of sixty days. The expiration date established by a financing statement filed prior to July 1, 1997, whether or not continued by a continuation statement shall remain in full force and effect and is not diminished by any subsequent amendments to this chapter. (b) Except as otherwise provided in subsections (e), (f), and (g), an initial financing statement filed in connection with a manufactured-home transaction is effective for a period of thirty years after the date of filing if it indicates that it is filed in connection with a manufactured-home transaction. (c) The effectiveness of a filed financing statement lapses on the expiration of the period of its effectiveness unless before the lapse a continuation statement is filed pursuant to subsection (d). Upon lapse, a financing statement ceases to be effective and any security interest or agricultural lien that was perfected by the financing statement becomes unperfected, unless the security interest is perfected otherwise. If the security interest or agricultural lien becomes unperfected upon lapse, it is deemed never to have been perfected as against a purchaser of the collateral for value. (d) A continuation statement may be filed only within six months before the expiration of the five-year period specified in subsection (a) or the thirty-year period specified in subsection (b), whichever is applicable. However, for financing statements filed before July 1, 1997, a continuation statement may be filed within six months before and sixty days after the expiration of the five-year period. (e) Except as otherwise provided in \u00a7 57A-9-510, upon timely filing of a continuation statement, the effectiveness of the initial financing statement continues for a period of five years and, for initial financing statements filed before July 1, 1997, the effectiveness of the initial financing statement continues for a period of five years and sixty days, commencing on the day on which the financing statement would have become ineffective in the absence of the filing. Upon the expiration of the five-year period, the financing statement lapses in the same manner as provided in subsection (c), unless, before the lapse, another continuation statement is filed pursuant to subsection (d). Succeeding continuation statements may be filed in the same manner to continue the effectiveness of the initial financing statement. (f) If a debtor is a transmitting utility and a filed initial financing statement so indicates, the financing statement is effective until a termination statement is filed. (g) A record of a mortgage that is effective as a financing statement filed as a fixture filing under \u00a7 57A-9-502(c) remains effective as a financing statement filed as a fixture filing until the mortgage is released or satisfied of record or its effectiveness otherwise terminates as to the real property. Section 14. That \u00a7 57A-9-516 be amended to read as follows: 57A-9-516. (a) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b), communication of a record to a filing office and tender of the filing fee or acceptance of the record by the filing office constitutes filing. (b) Filing does not occur with respect to a record that a filing office refuses to accept because: (1) The record is not communicated by a method or medium of communication authorized by the filing office; (2) An amount equal to or greater than the applicable filing fee is not tendered; (3) The filing office is unable to index the record because: (A) In the case of an initial financing statement, the record does not provide a name for the debtor; (B) In the case of an amendment or correction information statement, the record: (i) Does not identify the initial financing statement as required by \u00a7 57A-9-512 or 57A-9-518, as applicable; or (ii) Identifies an initial financing statement whose effectiveness has lapsed under \u00a7 57A-9-515; (C) In the case of an initial financing statement that provides the name of a debtor identified as an individual or an amendment that provides a name of a debtor identified as an individual which was not previously provided in the financing statement to which the record relates, the record does not identify the debtor's last name surname; or (D) In the case of a record filed or recorded in the filing office described in \u00a7 57A-9-501(a)(1), the record does not provide a sufficient description of the real property to which it relates; (4) In the case of an initial financing statement or an amendment that adds a secured party of record, the record does not provide a name and mailing address for the secured party of record; (5) In the case of an initial financing statement or an amendment that provides a name of a debtor which was not previously provided in the financing statement to which the amendment relates, the record does not: (A) Provide a mailing address for the debtor; or (B) Indicate whether the name provided as the name of the debtor is the name of an individual or an organization; or (C) If the financing statement indicates that the debtor is an organization, provide: (i) A type of organization for the debtor; (ii) A jurisdiction of organization for the debtor; or (iii) An organizational identification number for the debtor or indicate that the debtor has none; (6) In the case of an assignment reflected in an initial financing statement under \u00a7 57A-9-514(a) or an amendment filed under \u00a7 57A-9-514(b), the record does not provide a name and mailing address for the assignee; or (7) In the case of a continuation statement, the record is not filed within the six-month period prescribed by \u00a7 57A-9-515(d). (c) For purposes of subsection (b): (1) A record does not provide information if the filing office is unable to read or decipher the information; and (2) A record that does not indicate that it is an amendment or identify an initial financing statement to which it relates, as required by \u00a7 57A-9-512, 57A-9-514, or 57A-9-518, is an initial financing statement. (d) A record that is communicated to the filing office with tender of the filing fee, but which the filing office refuses to accept for a reason other than one set forth in subsection (b), is effective as a filed record except as against a purchaser of the collateral which gives value in reasonable reliance upon the absence of the record from the files. Section 15. That \u00a7 57A-9-518 be amended to read as follows: 57A-9-518. (a) A person may file in the filing office a correction an information statement with respect to a record indexed there under the person's name if the person believes that the record is inaccurate or was wrongfully filed. (b) A correction An information statement under subsection (a) must: (1) Identify the record to which it relates by: (A) The file number assigned to the initial financing statement to which the record relates; and (B) If the correction information statement relates to a record filed or recorded in a filing office described in \u00a7 57A-9-501(a)(1), the date and time that the initial financing statement was filed or recorded and the information specified in \u00a7 57A-9-502(b); (2) Indicate that it is a correction an information statement; and (3) Provide the basis for the person's belief that the record is inaccurate and indicate the manner in which the person believes the record should be amended to cure any inaccuracy or provide the basis for the person's belief that the record was wrongfully filed. (c) A person may file in the filing office an information statement with respect to a record filed there if the person is a secured party of record with respect to the financing statement to which the record relates and believes that the person that filed the record was not entitled to do so under \u00a7 57A-9-509(d). (d) An information statement under subsection (c) must: (1) Identify the record to which it relates by: (a) The file number assigned to the initial financing statement to which the record relates; and (b) If the statement relates to a record filed or recorded in a filing office described in \u00a7 57A-9-501(a)(1), the date and time that the initial financing statement was filed or recorded and the information specified in \u00a7 57A-9-502(b); (2) Indicate that it is an information statement; and (3) Provide the basis for the person's belief that the person that filed the record was not entitled to do so under \u00a7 57A-9-509(d).

(a) A filing office that accepts written records may not refuse to accept a written initial financing statement in the following form and format except for a reason set forth in \u00a7 57A-9-516(b). (b) A filing office that accepts written records may not refuse to accept a written record in the following form and format except for a reason set forth in \u00a7 57A-9-516(b). Section 17.

Section 9-801. This Act takes effect on July 1, 2013. Section 9-802. That chapter 57A-9 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: (a) Except as otherwise provided in this part, this Act applies to a transaction or lien within its scope, even if the transaction or lien was entered into or created before July 1, 2013. (b) This Act does not affect an action, case, or proceeding commenced before July 1, 2013. Section 9-803. That chapter 57A-9 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: (a) A security interest that is a perfected security interest immediately before this Act takes effect is a perfected security interest under chapter 57A-9 as amended by this Act if, when this Act takes effect, the applicable requirements for attachment and perfection under chapter 57A-9 as amended by this Act are satisfied without further action. (b) Except as otherwise provided in section 9-805 of this Act, if, immediately before this Act takes effect, a security interest is a perfected security interest, but the applicable requirements for perfection under chapter 57A-9 as amended by this Act are not satisfied when this Act takes effect, the security interest remains perfected thereafter only if the applicable requirements for perfection under chapter 57A-9 as amended by this Act are satisfied within one year after this Act takes effect. Section 9-804. That chapter 57A-9 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: A security interest that is an unperfected security interest immediately before this Act takes effect becomes a perfected security interest: (1) Without further action, when this Act takes effect if the applicable requirements for perfection under chapter-57A-9 as amended by this Act are satisfied before or at that time; or (2) When the applicable requirements for perfection are satisfied if the requirements are satisfied after that time. Section 9-805. That chapter 57A-9 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: (a) The filing of a financing statement before this Act takes effect is effective to perfect a security interest to the extent the filing would satisfy the applicable requirements for perfection under chapter 57A-9 as amended by this Act. (b) This Act does not render ineffective an effective financing statement that, before this Act takes effect, is filed and satisfies the applicable requirements for perfection under the law of the jurisdiction governing perfection as provided in chapter 57A-9 as it existed before the effective date of this Act. However, except as otherwise provided in subsections (c) and (d) and section 9-806 of this Act, the financing statement ceases to be effective: (1) If the financing statement is filed in this state, at the time the financing statement would have ceased to be effective had this Act not taken effect; or (2) If the financing statement is filed in another jurisdiction, at the earlier of: (A) The time the financing statement would have ceased to be effective under the law of that jurisdiction; or (B) June 30, 2018.

Section 9-806. That chapter 57A-9 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: (a) The filing of an initial financing statement in the office specified in \u00a7 57A-9-501 continues the effectiveness of a financing statement filed before this Act takes effect if: (1) The filing of an initial financing statement in that office would be effective to perfect a security interest under chapter 57A-9 as amended by this Act; (2) The pre-effective-date financing statement was filed in an office in another state; and (3) The initial financing statement satisfies subsection (c).

Section 9-807. That chapter 57A-9 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: (a) In this section, \"pre-effective-date financing statement\" means a financing statement filed before this Act takes effect. (b) After this Act takes effect, a person may add or delete collateral covered by, continue or terminate the effectiveness of, or otherwise amend the information provided in, a pre-effective-date financing statement only in accordance with the law of the jurisdiction governing perfection as provided in chapter 57A-9 as amended by this Act. However, the effectiveness of a pre-effective-date financing statement also may be terminated in accordance with the law of the jurisdiction in which the financing statement is filed. (c) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (d), if the law of this state governs perfection of a security interest, the information in a pre-effective-date financing statement may be amended after this Act takes effect only if: (1) The pre-effective-date financing statement and an amendment are filed in the office specified in \u00a7 57A-9-501; (2) An amendment is filed in the office specified in \u00a7 57A-9-501 concurrently with, or after the filing in that office of, an initial financing statement that satisfies section 9-806(c) of this Act; or (3) An initial financing statement that provides the information as amended and satisfies section 9-806(c) of this Act is filed in the office specified in \u00a7 57A-9-501. (d) If the law of this state governs perfection of a security interest, the effectiveness of a pre-effective-date financing statement may be continued only under section 9-805(c) and ( e) of this Act or section 9-806 of this Act.

Section 9-809. That chapter 57A-9 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: This Act determines the priority of conflicting claims to collateral. However, if the relative priorities of the claims were established before this Act takes effect, chapter 57A-9-as it existed before July 1, 2013 determines priority."}, {"bill_id": 3099,
