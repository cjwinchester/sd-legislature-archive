Section 2. That \u00a7 13-13-72 be amended to read: 13-13-72. It is the policy of the Legislature that the appropriation for state aid to education increase on an annual basis by the percentage increase in local need on an aggregate statewide basis so that the relative proportion of local need paid by local effort and state aid shall remain constant. For school fiscal years 2017 to 2022, inclusive, the proportion of local need paid by local effort and state aid shall be adjusted annually to maintain the proportion between state aid and local property taxes and to reflect adjustments in local effort due to the implementation of the other revenue base amount as defined in \u00a7 13-13-10.1. Section 3. That \u00a7 13-13-72.1 be amended to read: 13-13-72.1. Any adjustments in the levies specified in \u00a7 10-12-42 made pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 13-13-71 and 13-13-72 shall be based on maintaining the relationship between statewide local effort as a percentage of statewide local need in the fiscal year succeeding the fiscal year in which the adjustment is made. For school fiscal years 2017 to 2022, inclusive, the proportion of local need paid by local effort and state aid shall be adjusted annually to reflect adjustments in local effort due to the implementation of the other revenue base amount as defined in \u00a7 13-13-10.1. However, if the levies specified in \u00a7 10-12-42 are not adjusted to maintain this relationship, the target teacher salary as defined in \u00a7 13-13-10.1 shall be reduced to maintain the relationship between statewide local effort as a percentage of statewide local need."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [53478], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 9914, "action_date": "2019-01-25T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 52449, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/52449.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 193, "committee_id_action": 408, "committee_id_assigned": 427, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 9914, "action_date": "2019-02-06T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 52894, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/52894.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 427, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 9914, "action_date": "2019-02-06T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 53116, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/53116.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass", "journal_page": 321, "committee_id_action": 427, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 27879, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [1578, 1613, 1556, 1590, 1647, 1626, 1622, 1564, 1634, 1573], "Nay": [1436, 1644, 1637, 1624, 1627]}}, {"bill_id": 9914, "action_date": "2019-02-08T13:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 53351, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/53351.pdf", "status_text": "Fiscal Note Requested", "journal_page": 343, "committee_id_action": 408, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 9914, "action_date": "2019-02-08T13:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 53351, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/53351.pdf", "status_text": "Referred to", "journal_page": 343, "committee_id_action": 408, "committee_id_assigned": 440, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 9914, "action_date": "2019-02-08T13:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 53351, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/53351.pdf", "status_text": "Referred to", "journal_page": 345, "committee_id_action": 408, "committee_id_assigned": 438, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 9914, "action_date": "2019-02-20T08:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 53751, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/53751.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 438, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 9914, "action_date": "2019-02-20T08:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 53909, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/53909.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to the 41st legislative day", "journal_page": 446, "committee_id_action": 438, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 28467, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [1614, 1616, 1557, 1631, 1431, 1615, 1628, 1620], "Nay": [1618]}}]}
