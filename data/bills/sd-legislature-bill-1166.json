Section 18. If a corporation subject to the gross receipts tax under this Act fails for any reason to file the required returns or to pay the tax due, any of its officers having control, or supervision of, or charged with the responsibility for making such returns and payments are personally liable for such failure. The dissolution of a corporation does not discharge an officer's liability for a prior failure of the corporation to make a return or remit the tax due. The sum due for such a liability may be assessed and collected as provided by law. If any responsible corporate officer elects not to be personally liable for the failure to file the required returns or to pay the tax due, the corporation shall provide the department with a surety bond or certificate of deposit as security for payment of any tax that may become due. The bond or certificate of deposit provided for in this section shall be in an amount equal to the estimated annual gross receipts multiplied by the applicable gross receipts tax rate."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 1166, "action_date": "2009-02-03T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 6759, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/6759.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 265, "committee_id_action": 56, "committee_id_assigned": 50, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 1166, "action_date": "2009-02-17T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 7301, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/7301.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 50, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 1166, "action_date": "2009-02-19T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 7522, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/7522.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 50, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 1166, "action_date": "2009-02-19T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 7767, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/7767.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to the 41st legislative day", "journal_page": 434, "committee_id_action": 50, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 4290, "president_vote": null, "Excused": [699], "Yea": [709, 725, 721, 717, 645, 734, 710, 658, 678], "Nay": [644, 672, 698, 711, 719]}}]}
