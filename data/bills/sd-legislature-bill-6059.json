WHEREAS, the construction of railroads was a key part of the history and heritage of the State of South Dakota; and WHEREAS, the construction of railroads keeps heavy trucks off the roads of the state and saves us from excessive new gas taxes for the average consumer; and WHEREAS, in 2006, $38 million was removed from the railroad trust fund and placed in the property tax reduction fund; and WHEREAS, restoring money taken from dedicated funds is in keeping with South Dakota values; and WHEREAS, the state has received a very large windfall of resources in the current fiscal year which could be used to restore these funds; and WHEREAS, President Ronald Reagan, when running for president in 1980, said repeatedly, \"If not us, who? If not now, when?\"; and WHEREAS, this statement by Ronald Reagan should reflect our attitude towards the replacement of dedicated funds to their rightful place: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the House of Representatives of the Eighty-Ninth Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the Senate concurring therein, that the Legislature resolves to begin a deliberate and ongoing effort to restore dedicated funds to their original location in the accounting system of South Dakota, to urge the executive branch to do the same, and to resolve to refuse to engage in this practice in the future."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 6059, "action_date": "2014-02-25T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 31052, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/31052.pdf", "status_text": "First Reading", "journal_page": 524, "committee_id_action": 231, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 6059, "action_date": "2014-02-26T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 31117, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/31117.pdf", "status_text": "Adopt Resolution", "journal_page": 568, "committee_id_action": 231, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 16681, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [528, 527, 453, 525, 467, 524, 489, 517, 519, 505, 431, 425, 504, 481, 509, 503, 501, 479, 454, 496, 458, 451, 466, 845, 499, 476, 521, 507, 478, 487, 423, 439, 500, 515, 511, 518, 462, 514, 459, 450, 506, 430, 468, 498, 461, 516, 480, 460, 441], "Nay": [522, 456, 455, 457, 523, 442, 502, 497, 512, 484, 464, 510, 513, 508, 448], "Excused": [433, 449, 477, 520, 463, 485]}}, {"bill_id": 6059, "action_date": "2014-02-27T13:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 31212, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/31212.pdf", "status_text": "First read and referred to", "journal_page": 497, "committee_id_action": 229, "committee_id_assigned": 216, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 6059, "action_date": "2014-03-03T09:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 31196, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/31196.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 216, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": null, "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 6059, "action_date": "2014-03-03T09:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 31279, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/31279.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to the 41st legislative day", "journal_page": 507, "committee_id_action": 216, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 16784, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [429, 436, 526, 492, 491, 495, 434]}}]}
