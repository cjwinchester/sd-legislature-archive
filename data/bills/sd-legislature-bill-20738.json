The debtor shall give the title lender possession of the certificate of title to such motor vehicle. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, the provisions of chapter 57A-9 apply to title loans and to persons engaged in the business of making title loans. Section 13. That chapter 54-4 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Any title loan shall be for an initial term of no more than one month but may be renewed for additional one-month periods. No title loan may be renewed more than four times except as provided in this section. Upon the fifth renewal of a title loan, and through the eighth renewal, the debtor shall make payment of at least ten percent of the original principal amount of the title loan, in addition to any finance charges that are due. If at any renewal requiring a principal reduction, the debtor has not made previous principal reductions adequate to satisfy the current required principal reduction, and the debtor does not pay at least ten percent of the original loan amount, the title lender may either declare the debtor in default or renew the title loan and defer the required principal payment for an additional period. However, no further finance charges may accrue or be earned against the principal amount so deferred. For purposes of this section, a renewal is any extension or continuation of a title loan for an additional period without any change to the title loan or its terms other than a reduction in principal. After the eighth renewal the title loan is due in full and no further finance charges or fees may accrue or be earned. Section 14. That chapter 54-4 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: If a debtor defaults in the repayment of a title loan, the title lender's sole remedy is to seek possession and sale of the motor vehicle securing the loan, and the title lender may not pursue the debtor personally in any action or proceeding for repayment of the loan or for any deficiency after the sale. The title lender shall return to the debtor any surplus obtained after the sale that is in excess of the amount owed on the loan after any reasonable expenses of repossession, storage, and sale, including court costs and attorney's fees have been deducted. The remedy limitation provided in this section does not apply in the following circumstances: (1) If a debtor obtains a title loan from a title lender under false pretenses by not disclosing the existence of a valid prior lien or security interest affecting the motor vehicle; or (2) If the debtor intentionally conceals, impairs, or destroys the collateral."}, {"bill_id": 20738,
