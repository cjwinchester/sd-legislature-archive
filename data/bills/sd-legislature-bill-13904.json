BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 32-12-12 be amended to read as follows: 32-12-12. A restricted minor's permit may be issued, upon application and payment of the proper fee as provided for in \u00a7 32-12-16, successful completion of a driver education class which has been approved by the Division of Education Services and Resources, and passage of all driver's license examination tests, to any minor between the ages of fourteen and sixteen years. A restricted minor's permit entitles the permit holder, while having the permit in his immediate physical possession, to operate a motor vehicle during the hours of 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. standard time if the motor vehicle is being operated with the permission of the minor's parents or guardian and during the hours of 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. if the motor vehicle is being operated under the direction of the minor's parent or guardian who is occupying a seat beside the driver. The restrictions as to time of operation and operation under the direction of a parent or guardian do not apply to the permit holder of a valid restricted minor's permit operating a self-propelled agricultural machine which is not subject to registration under chapter 32-5. 750 copies of this document were printed by the South Dakota Legislative Research Council at a cost of $.016 per page. .
