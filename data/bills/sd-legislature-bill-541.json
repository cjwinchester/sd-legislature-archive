Notwithstanding the provisions of \u00a7 10-6-33, beginning on July 1, 2009, agricultural land shall be assessed based on its agricultural income value on a per acre basis. The agricultural income value of agricultural land shall be determined on the basis of productivity and the annual earnings capacity of the agricultural land. The productivity of agricultural land and its annual earning capacity shall be based on data collected and analyzed pursuant to this section and \u00a7\u00a7 10-6-33.29 to 10-6-33.33, inclusive. Agricultural income value is defined as the capitalized average annual earning capacity on a per acre basis which has been adjusted by an amount that reflects the landowner's share of the gross return. The capacity of cropland to produce agricultural products shall be based on the income from crops or plants produced on the land. The capacity of noncropland to produce agricultural products shall be based on cash rents or the animal unit carrying capacity of the land , or a combination of both . For the purpose of this section, annual earning capacity for cropland and noncropland shall be determined by the 2009 and 2010 Legislature : (1) Cropland is thirty-five percent of the annual gross return to the land; and (2) Noncropland is one hundred percent of the annual gross return to the land based on cash rent for noncropland . The annual earning capacity shall be capitalized at a rate of six and six-tenths percent to determine the agricultural income value. Section 2.

Locally adjusted crop prices shall be established by adjusting statewide prices. The noncropland data shall include: cash rents, rangeland acres, pastureland acres, rangeland AUM's per acre, pastureland AUM's per acre, grazing season data, and statewide cow and calf prices. The secretary shall have such data collected for 2001, which will serve as the first year of the database, and each year thereafter. The database shall consist of the most recent eight years of data that have been collected and the two years, one year representing the highest agricultural income value and one year representing the lowest agricultural income value, shall be discarded from the database. The database for the 2010 assessment for taxes payable in 2011 shall consist of data from 2001 to 2008, inclusive, and the database for each assessment year thereafter shall be adjusted accordingly.
