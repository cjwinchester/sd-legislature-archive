A health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review organization may use its existing medical exceptions process to satisfy this requirement. The process shall be made easily accessible on the health carrier's, health benefit plan's, or utilization review organization's website. Section 4. That a NEW SECTION be added: 58-17H-55. Exceptions. A step therapy exception shall be expeditiously granted if: (1) The required prescription drug is contraindicated or will likely cause an adverse reaction by or physical or mental harm to the patient; (2) The required prescription drug is expected to be ineffective based on the known clinical characteristics of the patient and the known characteristics of the prescription drug regimen; (3) The patient has tried the required prescription drug while under their current or a previous health insurance or health benefit plan, or another prescription drug in the same pharmacologic class or with the same mechanism of action and such prescription drug was discontinued due to lack of efficacy or effectiveness, diminished effect, or an adverse event; (4) The required prescription drug is not in the best interest of the patient, based on medical necessity; or (5) The patient is stable on a prescription drug selected by their health care provider for the medical condition under consideration while on a current or previous health insurance or health benefit plan.

Should a response by a health carrier, health benefit plan, or utilization review organization not be received within the time allotted, the step therapy exception request shall be deemed granted.

Any denial of a request for a step therapy override exception is subject to the grievance procedures located in chapter 58-17I.
