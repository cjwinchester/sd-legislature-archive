The following provisions dictate the responsibility of the prior carrier and succeeding carrier when coverage is discontinued: (1) After discontinuance of the policy, contract, or certificate, the prior carrier remains liable only to the extent of its accrued liabilities and extensions of benefits. The position of the prior carrier shall be the same whether the group policyholder or other entity secures replacement coverage from a new carrier, self-insures, or foregoes the provision of coverage; (2) If the individual was validly covered under the prior plan on the date of discontinuance, each individual who is eligible for coverage in accordance with the succeeding carrier's plan of benefits is, with respect to the class or classes of individuals, eligible and shall be covered under the succeeding carrier's plan if (a) any actively-at-work and nonconfinement rules are met, and (b) if required by the succeeding carrier, the individual requests enrollment; (3) Each person not covered under the succeeding carrier's plan of benefits in accordance with subdivision (2) shall nevertheless be covered by the succeeding carrier in accordance with the following rules if the individual was validly covered, including benefit extension, under the prior plan on the date of discontinuance and if the individual is a member of the class or classes of individuals eligible for coverage under the succeeding carrier's plan. Any reference in the following subdivisions to an individual who was or was not totally disabled is a reference to the individual's status immediately prior to the date the succeeding carrier's coverage becomes effective; (4) The minimum level of benefits to be provided by the succeeding carrier shall be the applicable level of benefits of the prior carrier's plan reduced by any benefits payable by the prior plan; (5) Coverage shall be provided by the succeeding carrier until the earliest of the following dates: (a) The date the individual becomes eligible under the succeeding carrier's plan as described in subdivision (1); (b) The date the individual's coverage would terminate in accordance with the succeeding carrier's plan provisions applicable to individual termination of coverage, such as at termination of employment or ceasing to be an eligible dependent; or (c) In the case of an individual who was totally disabled, and in the case of a type of coverage for which \u00a7 58-16-53 requires an extension of benefits or accrued liability, the end of any period of extension benefits or accrued liability that is required of the prior carrier by \u00a7 53-16-53 \u00a7 58-16-53, or if the prior carrier's policy, contract, or certificate is not subject to that section, but would have been required of the prior carrier had the policy, contract, or certificate been subject to \u00a7 58-16-53 at the time the prior carrier's plan was discontinued and replaced by the succeeding carrier's plan; (6) In any situation in which a determination of the prior carrier's benefit is required by the succeeding carrier, at the succeeding carrier's request the prior carrier shall furnish a statement of the benefits available or pertinent information, sufficient to permit verification of the benefit determination or the determination itself by the succeeding carrier. For the purposes of this subdivision, benefits of the prior plan shall be determined in accordance with all of the definitions, conditions, and covered expense provisions of the prior plan rather than those of the succeeding plan. The benefit determination shall be made as if coverage had not been replaced by the succeeding carrier; (7) A succeeding carrier's policy may contain a provision limiting benefits to employees who are actively at work. However, any individual who remains as an employee, was covered by the prior carrier, and was disabled as of the date the succeeding carrier coverage became effective for that employer, will continue to be covered by the prior carrier as long as the individual remains an employee. An individual who is not disabled and is not at work on the date the succeeding carrier's coverage commences is considered actively at work as long as the absence from work is an employer-approved absence.

Nothing in this subpart shall limit the duty of the association to render a report of its activities under \u00a7 58-29C-58. C. For the purpose of carrying out its obligations under this chapter, the association shall be deemed to be a creditor of the impaired or insolvent insurer to the extent of assets attributable to covered policies reduced by any amounts to which the association is entitled as subrogee pursuant to subpart \u00a7 58-29C-51K K of \u00a7 58-29C-51.

Assets attributable to covered policies, as used in this subpart, are that proportion of the assets which the reserves that should have been established for such policies bear to the reserves that should have been established for all policies of insurance written by the impaired or insolvent insurer. D. As a creditor of the impaired or insolvent insurer as established in subpart C of this section and consistent with \u00a7 58-29B-98, the association and other similar associations shall be entitled to receive a disbursement of assets out of the marshaled assets, from time to time as the assets become available to reimburse it, as a credit against contractual obligations under this chapter. If the liquidator has not, within one hundred twenty days of a final determination of insolvency of an insurer by the receivership court, made an application to the court for the approval of a proposal to disburse assets out of marshaled assets to guaranty associations having obligations because of the insolvency, then the association shall be entitled to make application to the receivership court for approval of its own proposal to disburse these assets. E. (1) Prior to the termination of any liquidation, rehabilitation, or conservation proceeding, the court may take into consideration the contributions of the respective parties, including the association, the shareholders, and policy owners of the insolvent insurer, and any other party with a bona fide interest, in making an equitable distribution of the ownership rights of the insolvent insurer. In such a determination, consideration shall be given to the welfare of the policy owners of the continuing or successor insurer. (2) No distribution to stockholders, if any, of an impaired or insolvent insurer shall be made until and unless the total amount of valid claims of the association with interest thereon for funds expended in carrying out its powers and duties under \u00a7 58-29C-51 with respect to the insurer have been fully recovered by the association. F. (1) If an order for liquidation or rehabilitation of an insurer domiciled in this state has been entered, the receiver appointed under the order has a right to recover on behalf of the insurer, from any affiliate that controlled it, the amount of distributions, other than stock dividends paid by the insurer on its capital stock, made at any time during the five years preceding the petition for liquidation or rehabilitation subject to the limitations of subdivisions (2) to (4), inclusive. (2) No such distribution is recoverable if the insurer shows that when paid the distribution was lawful and reasonable, and that the insurer did not know and could not reasonably have known that the distribution might adversely affect the ability of the insurer to fulfill its contractual obligations. (3) Any person who was an affiliate that controlled the insurer at the time the distributions were paid is liable up to the amount of distributions received. Any person who was an affiliate that controlled the insurer at the time the distributions were declared, shall be liable up to the amount of distributions which would have been received if they had been paid immediately. If two or more persons are liable with respect to the same distributions, they shall be jointly and severally liable. (4) The maximum amount recoverable under this subpart shall be the amount needed in excess of all other available assets of the insolvent insurer to pay the contractual obligations of the insolvent insurer. (5) If any person liable under subdivision (3) is insolvent, all its affiliates that controlled it at the time the distribution was paid, shall be jointly and severally liable for any resulting deficiency in the amount recovered from the insolvent affiliate.

Notwithstanding \u00a7 10-54-1, a A seller, who possesses an exemption certificate from a purchaser of tangible personal property, any product transferred electronically, or services which indicates the items or services being purchased are exempt, may rely on the exemption certificate and not charge sales tax to the provider of the exemption certificate until the provider of the exemption certificate gives notice that the items or services being purchased are no longer exempt by filing a new exemption certificate with the seller. The exemption certificate shall be signed by the purchaser. The exemption certificate shall provide the purchaser's name, address, and valid state tax license number, if applicable. However, any person filing an electronic exemption certificate is not required to sign the exemption certificate. The purchaser claiming the protection of an exemption certificate is responsible for assuring that the goods and services delivered thereafter are of a type covered by the exemption certificate. A seller of property, any product transferred electronically, or services which are generally described under the exemption certificate is not responsible for the collection of the tax unless otherwise directed by the purchaser. If the purchaser later determines there is any tax due and owing, the purchaser shall remit the tax owed by the purchaser to the state. If the purchaser makes an exempt purchase and later determines that the goods or services purchased are not exempt, the purchaser shall report the transaction and pay the use tax on the next filing of the purchaser's return. Any purchaser who knowingly files an exemption certificate with a retailer in order to purchase tangible personal property, any product transferred electronically, or services with the intent to evade payment of the tax, and fails to timely report the same with the department is guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor. The secretary of revenue may assess a penalty of up to fifty percent of the tax owed, in addition to the tax owed. No interest may be charged on the penalty. The seller shall retain the exemption certificate for a period of three years from the date it is filed by the purchaser and provide the exemption certificate to the department upon request. The secretary may promulgate rules pursuant to chapter 1-26 to adopt forms for exemption certificates. Section 24. That \u00a7 10-52-3 be AMENDED: 10-52-3.

The following provisions dictate the responsibility of the prior carrier and succeeding carrier when coverage is discontinued: (1) After discontinuance of the policy, contract, or certificate, the prior carrier remains liable only to the extent of its accrued liabilities and extensions of benefits. The position of the prior carrier shall be the same whether the group policyholder or other entity secures replacement coverage from a new carrier, self-insures, or foregoes the provision of coverage; (2) If the individual was validly covered under the prior plan on the date of discontinuance, each individual who is eligible for coverage in accordance with the succeeding carrier's plan of benefits is, with respect to the class or classes of individuals, eligible and shall be covered under the succeeding carrier's plan if (a) any actively-at-work and nonconfinement rules are met, and (b) if required by the succeeding carrier, the individual requests enrollment; (3) Each person not covered under the succeeding carrier's plan of benefits in accordance with subdivision (2) shall nevertheless be covered by the succeeding carrier in accordance with the following rules if the individual was validly covered, including benefit extension, under the prior plan on the date of discontinuance and if the individual is a member of the class or classes of individuals eligible for coverage under the succeeding carrier's plan. Any reference in the following subdivisions to an individual who was or was not totally disabled is a reference to the individual's status immediately prior to the date the succeeding carrier's coverage becomes effective; (4) The minimum level of benefits to be provided by the succeeding carrier shall be the applicable level of benefits of the prior carrier's plan reduced by any benefits payable by the prior plan; (5) Coverage shall be provided by the succeeding carrier until the earliest of the following dates: (a) The date the individual becomes eligible under the succeeding carrier's plan as described in subdivision (1); (b) The date the individual's coverage would terminate in accordance with the succeeding carrier's plan provisions applicable to individual termination of coverage, such as at termination of employment or ceasing to be an eligible dependent; or (c) In the case of an individual who was totally disabled, and in the case of a type of coverage for which \u00a7 58-16-53 requires an extension of benefits or accrued liability, the end of any period of extension benefits or accrued liability that is required of the prior carrier by \u00a7 53-16-53 \u00a7 58-16-53, or if the prior carrier's policy, contract, or certificate is not subject to that section, but would have been required of the prior carrier had the policy, contract, or certificate been subject to \u00a7 58-16-53 at the time the prior carrier's plan was discontinued and replaced by the succeeding carrier's plan; (6) In any situation in which a determination of the prior carrier's benefit is required by the succeeding carrier, at the succeeding carrier's request the prior carrier shall furnish a statement of the benefits available or pertinent information, sufficient to permit verification of the benefit determination or the determination itself by the succeeding carrier. For the purposes of this subdivision, benefits of the prior plan shall be determined in accordance with all of the definitions, conditions, and covered expense provisions of the prior plan rather than those of the succeeding plan. The benefit determination shall be made as if coverage had not been replaced by the succeeding carrier; (7) A succeeding carrier's policy may contain a provision limiting benefits to employees who are actively at work. However, any individual who remains as an employee, was covered by the prior carrier, and was disabled as of the date the succeeding carrier coverage became effective for that employer, will continue to be covered by the prior carrier as long as the individual remains an employee. An individual who is not disabled and is not at work on the date the succeeding carrier's coverage commences is considered actively at work as long as the absence from work is an employer-approved absence.

Records shall be kept of all meetings of the board of directors to discuss the activities of the association in carrying out its powers and duties under \u00a7 58-29C-51. The records of the association with respect to an impaired or insolvent insurer may not be disclosed prior to the termination of a liquidation, rehabilitation, or conservation proceeding involving the impaired or insolvent insurer, except (i) upon the termination of the impairment or insolvency of the insurer, or (ii) upon the order of a court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this subpart shall limit the duty of the association to render a report of its activities under \u00a7 58-29C-58. C. For the purpose of carrying out its obligations under this chapter, the association shall be deemed to be a creditor of the impaired or insolvent insurer to the extent of assets attributable to covered policies reduced by any amounts to which the association is entitled as subrogee pursuant to subpart \u00a7 58-29C-51K K of \u00a7 58-29C-51. Assets of the impaired or insolvent insurer attributable to covered policies shall be used to continue all covered policies and pay all contractual obligations of the impaired or insolvent insurer as required by this chapter. Assets attributable to covered policies, as used in this subpart, are that proportion of the assets which the reserves that should have been established for such policies bear to the reserves that should have been established for all policies of insurance written by the impaired or insolvent insurer. D. As a creditor of the impaired or insolvent insurer as established in subpart C of this section and consistent with \u00a7 58-29B-98, the association and other similar associations shall be entitled to receive a disbursement of assets out of the marshaled assets, from time to time as the assets become available to reimburse it, as a credit against contractual obligations under this chapter. If the liquidator has not, within one hundred twenty days of a final determination of insolvency of an insurer by the receivership court, made an application to the court for the approval of a proposal to disburse assets out of marshaled assets to guaranty associations having obligations because of the insolvency, then the association shall be entitled to make application to the receivership court for approval of its own proposal to disburse these assets. E. (1) Prior to the termination of any liquidation, rehabilitation, or conservation proceeding, the court may take into consideration the contributions of the respective parties, including the association, the shareholders, and policy owners of the insolvent insurer, and any other party with a bona fide interest, in making an equitable distribution of the ownership rights of the insolvent insurer. In such a determination, consideration shall be given to the welfare of the policy owners of the continuing or successor insurer. (2) No distribution to stockholders, if any, of an impaired or insolvent insurer shall be made until and unless the total amount of valid claims of the association with interest thereon for funds expended in carrying out its powers and duties under \u00a7 58-29C-51 with respect to the insurer have been fully recovered by the association. F. (1) If an order for liquidation or rehabilitation of an insurer domiciled in this state has been entered, the receiver appointed under the order has a right to recover on behalf of the insurer, from any affiliate that controlled it, the amount of distributions, other than stock dividends paid by the insurer on its capital stock, made at any time during the five years preceding the petition for liquidation or rehabilitation subject to the limitations of subdivisions (2) to (4), inclusive. (2) No such distribution is recoverable if the insurer shows that when paid the distribution was lawful and reasonable, and that the insurer did not know and could not reasonably have known that the distribution might adversely affect the ability of the insurer to fulfill its contractual obligations. (3) Any person who was an affiliate that controlled the insurer at the time the distributions were paid is liable up to the amount of distributions received. Any person who was an affiliate that controlled the insurer at the time the distributions were declared, shall be liable up to the amount of distributions which would have been received if they had been paid immediately. If two or more persons are liable with respect to the same distributions, they shall be jointly and severally liable. (4) The maximum amount recoverable under this subpart shall be the amount needed in excess of all other available assets of the insolvent insurer to pay the contractual obligations of the insolvent insurer. (5) If any person liable under subdivision (3) is insolvent, all its affiliates that controlled it at the time the distribution was paid, shall be jointly and severally liable for any resulting deficiency in the amount recovered from the insolvent affiliate.

The following provisions dictate the responsibility of the prior carrier and succeeding carrier when coverage is discontinued: (1) After discontinuance of the policy, contract, or certificate, the prior carrier remains liable only to the extent of its accrued liabilities and extensions of benefits. The position of the prior carrier shall be the same whether the group policyholder or other entity secures replacement coverage from a new carrier, self-insures, or foregoes the provision of coverage; (2) If the individual was validly covered under the prior plan on the date of discontinuance, each individual who is eligible for coverage in accordance with the succeeding carrier's plan of benefits is, with respect to the class or classes of individuals, eligible and shall be covered under the succeeding carrier's plan if (a) any actively-at-work and nonconfinement rules are met, and (b) if required by the succeeding carrier, the individual requests enrollment; (3) Each person not covered under the succeeding carrier's plan of benefits in accordance with subdivision (2) shall nevertheless be covered by the succeeding carrier in accordance with the following rules if the individual was validly covered, including benefit extension, under the prior plan on the date of discontinuance and if the individual is a member of the class or classes of individuals eligible for coverage under the succeeding carrier's plan. Any reference in the following subdivisions to an individual who was or was not totally disabled is a reference to the individual's status immediately prior to the date the succeeding carrier's coverage becomes effective; (4) The minimum level of benefits to be provided by the succeeding carrier shall be the applicable level of benefits of the prior carrier's plan reduced by any benefits payable by the prior plan; (5) Coverage shall be provided by the succeeding carrier until the earliest of the following dates: (a) The date the individual becomes eligible under the succeeding carrier's plan as described in subdivision (1); (b) The date the individual's coverage would terminate in accordance with the succeeding carrier's plan provisions applicable to individual termination of coverage, such as at termination of employment or ceasing to be an eligible dependent; or (c) In the case of an individual who was totally disabled, and in the case of a type of coverage for which \u00a7 58-16-53 requires an extension of benefits or accrued liability, the end of any period of extension benefits or accrued liability that is required of the prior carrier by \u00a7 58-16-53, or if the prior carrier's policy, contract, or certificate is not subject to that section, but would have been required of the prior carrier had the policy, contract, or certificate been subject to \u00a7 58-16-53 at the time the prior carrier's plan was discontinued and replaced by the succeeding carrier's plan; (6) In any situation in which a determination of the prior carrier's benefit is required by the succeeding carrier, at the succeeding carrier's request the prior carrier shall furnish a statement of the benefits available or pertinent information, sufficient to permit verification of the benefit determination or the determination itself by the succeeding carrier. For the purposes of this subdivision, benefits of the prior plan shall be determined in accordance with all of the definitions, conditions, and covered expense provisions of the prior plan rather than those of the succeeding plan. The benefit determination shall be made as if coverage had not been replaced by the succeeding carrier; (7) A succeeding carrier's policy may contain a provision limiting benefits to employees who are actively at work. However, any individual who remains as an employee, was covered by the prior carrier, and was disabled as of the date the succeeding carrier coverage became effective for that employer, will continue to be covered by the prior carrier as long as the individual remains an employee. An individual who is not disabled and is not at work on the date the succeeding carrier's coverage commences is considered actively at work as long as the absence from work is an employer-approved absence.

The plan of operation shall, in addition to requirements enumerated elsewhere in this chapter: (1) Establish procedures for handling the assets of the association; (2) Establish the amount and method of reimbursing members of the board of directors under \u00a7 58-29C-50; (3) Establish regular places and times for meetings including telephone conference calls of the board of directors; (4) Establish procedures for records to be kept of all financial transactions of the association, its agents, and the board of directors; (5) Establish the procedures whereby selections for the board of directors will be made and submitted to the director; (6) Establish any additional procedures for assessments under \u00a7 58-29C-52; (7) Contain additional provisions necessary or proper for the execution of the powers and duties of the association; (8) Establish procedures whereby a director may be removed for cause, including in the case where a member insurer director becomes an impaired or insolvent insurer; (9) Require the board of directors to establish a policy and procedures for addressing conflicts of interests. D. The plan of operation may provide that any or all powers and duties of the association, except those under subdivision 58-29C-51(L)(3) and \u00a7 58-29C-52, are delegated to a corporation, association, or other organization which performs or will perform functions similar to those of this association, or its equivalent, in two or more states. Such a corporation, association, or organization shall be reimbursed for any payments made on behalf of the association and shall be paid for its performance of any function of the association. A delegation under this subpart shall take effect only with the approval of both the board of directors and the director, and may be made only to a corporation, association, or organization which extends protection not substantially less favorable and effective than that provided by this chapter. Section 161. That \u00a7 58-29C-56 be AMENDED: 58-29C-56. Member assessment as offset against premium tax liability. A. A member insurer may offset against its premium tax liability to this state an assessment described in subpart H of \u00a7 58-29C-52 to the extent of twenty percent of the amount of the assessment for each of the five calendar years following the year in which the assessment was paid. If the assessment is five hundred dollars or less, the member insurer shall take the total offset in the first year following the year in which the assessment was paid. However, total assessments offset against premium taxes may not exceed two million dollars in any year. If offsets exceed the annual limitation in this section, the excess may be carried forward to a subsequent year in which the annual limitation has not been exceeded. Any excess shall be apportioned among the contributing insurers in relation to their assessment that caused the limit to be exceeded. In the event a member insurer should cease doing business, all uncredited assessments may be credited against its premium tax liability for the year it ceases doing business. B. Any sums that are acquired by refund, pursuant to subpart F of \u00a7 58-29C-52, from the association by member insurers, and that have been offset against premium taxes as provided in subpart A of this section, shall be paid by the insurers to this state in such manner as the tax authorities may require. The association shall notify the director that refunds have been made. Section 162. That \u00a7 58-29C-57 be AMENDED: 58-29C-57. Liability for unpaid assessment not reduced for impaired or insolvent insurer--Records of meetings--Association as creditor of impaired or insolvent insurer--Liquidation, rehabilitation, or conservation proceedings. A. This chapter may not be construed to reduce the liability for unpaid assessments of the insureds of an impaired or insolvent insurer operating under a plan with assessment liability. B. Records shall be kept of all meetings of the board of directors to discuss the activities of the association in carrying out its powers and duties under \u00a7 58-29C-51. The records of the association with respect to an impaired or insolvent insurer may not be disclosed prior to the termination of a liquidation, rehabilitation, or conservation proceeding involving the impaired or insolvent insurer, except (i) upon the termination of the impairment or insolvency of the insurer, or (ii) upon the order of a court of competent jurisdiction. Nothing in this subpart shall limit the duty of the association to render a report of its activities under \u00a7 58-29C-58. C. For the purpose of carrying out its obligations under this chapter, the association shall be deemed to be a creditor of the impaired or insolvent insurer to the extent of assets attributable to covered policies reduced by any amounts to which the association is entitled as subrogee pursuant to subpart K of \u00a7 58-29C-51. Assets of the impaired or insolvent insurer attributable to covered policies shall be used to continue all covered policies and pay all contractual obligations of the impaired or insolvent insurer as required by this chapter. Assets attributable to covered policies, as used in this subpart, are that proportion of the assets which the reserves that should have been established for such policies bear to the reserves that should have been established for all policies of insurance written by the impaired or insolvent insurer. D. As a creditor of the impaired or insolvent insurer as established in subpart C of this section and consistent with \u00a7 58-29B-98, the association and other similar associations shall be entitled to receive a disbursement of assets out of the marshaled assets, from time to time as the assets become available to reimburse it, as a credit against contractual obligations under this chapter. If the liquidator has not, within one hundred twenty days of a final determination of insolvency of an insurer by the receivership court, made an application to the court for the approval of a proposal to disburse assets out of marshaled assets to guaranty associations having obligations because of the insolvency, then the association shall be entitled to make application to the receivership court for approval of its own proposal to disburse these assets. E. (1) Prior to the termination of any liquidation, rehabilitation, or conservation proceeding, the court may take into consideration the contributions of the respective parties, including the association, the shareholders, and policy owners of the insolvent insurer, and any other party with a bona fide interest, in making an equitable distribution of the ownership rights of the insolvent insurer. In such a determination, consideration shall be given to the welfare of the policy owners of the continuing or successor insurer. (2) No distribution to stockholders, if any, of an impaired or insolvent insurer shall be made until and unless the total amount of valid claims of the association with interest thereon for funds expended in carrying out its powers and duties under \u00a7 58-29C-51 with respect to the insurer have been fully recovered by the association. F. (1) If an order for liquidation or rehabilitation of an insurer domiciled in this state has been entered, the receiver appointed under the order has a right to recover on behalf of the insurer, from any affiliate that controlled it, the amount of distributions, other than stock dividends paid by the insurer on its capital stock, made at any time during the five years preceding the petition for liquidation or rehabilitation subject to the limitations of subdivisions (2) to (4), inclusive. (2) No such distribution is recoverable if the insurer shows that when paid the distribution was lawful and reasonable, and that the insurer did not know and could not reasonably have known that the distribution might adversely affect the ability of the insurer to fulfill its contractual obligations. (3) Any person who was an affiliate that controlled the insurer at the time the distributions were paid is liable up to the amount of distributions received. Any person who was an affiliate that controlled the insurer at the time the distributions were declared, shall be liable up to the amount of distributions which would have been received if they had been paid immediately. If two or more persons are liable with respect to the same distributions, they shall be jointly and severally liable. (4) The maximum amount recoverable under this subpart shall be the amount needed in excess of all other available assets of the insolvent insurer to pay the contractual obligations of the insolvent insurer. (5) If any person liable under subdivision (3) is insolvent, all its affiliates that controlled it at the time the distribution was paid, shall be jointly and severally liable for any resulting deficiency in the amount recovered from the insolvent affiliate. Section 163. That \u00a7 58-29D-16 be AMENDED: 58-29D-16. Provisions in written agreement as to withdrawals from fiduciary account. The administrator may not pay any claim by withdrawals from a fiduciary account in which premiums or charges are deposited. Withdrawals from such account shall be made as provided in the written agreement between the administrator and the insurer. The written agreement shall address the following: (1) Remittance to an insurer entitled to remittance; (2) Deposit in an account maintained in the name of the insurer; (3) Transfer to and deposit in a claims\u2011paying account; (4) Payment to a group policyholder for remittance to the insurer entitled to such remittance; (5) Payment to the administrator of its commissions, fees or charges; or (6) Remittance of return premium to the person or persons entitled to such return premium. Section 164. That \u00a7 58-30-190 be AMENDED: 58-30-190. Waiver of privilege or claim of confidentiality.

Written notice of the meeting of the policyholders shall be given to all policyholders, which may be either an annual or special meeting. Written notice shall be given to each policyholder of record whether or not entitled to vote at the meeting, not less than twenty days before the meeting, in the manner provided in \u00a7\u00a7 47-1A-701 through 47-1A-747, and \u00a7\u00a7 47-1A-1601 through 47-1A-1620, for the giving of notice of meetings of shareholders.
