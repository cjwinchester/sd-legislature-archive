It is a Class 2 misdemeanor for a nonresident to hunt, take, or kill small game, other than migratory waterfowl, without a nonresident small game license or in violation of the conditions of the license or the rules of the Game, Fish and Parks Commission. It is a Class 2 misdemeanor for a nonresident to hunt, take, or kill dove and snipe without a nonresident small game license and a migratory bird certification permit, or in violation of the rules of the Game, Fish and Parks Commission. It is a Class 2 misdemeanor for a nonresident to hunt, take, or kill sandhill crane without a nonresident small game license or nonresident waterfowl license and a migratory bird certification permit, or in violation of the rules of the Game, Fish and Parks Commission. A nonresident small game license, except as otherwise provided in this title and except for the taking of migratory waterfowl, entitles the licensee to all of the privileges of a resident small game hunting license for two periods of five consecutive days during the period for which it is valid. Nonresident small game licenses shall be available to applicants for two periods of five consecutive days or five periods of two consecutive days. The Game, Fish and Parks Commission may provide for other combinations of days in rules promulgated pursuant to chapter 1-26 if the total number of days for which the license is valid does not exceed ten.
