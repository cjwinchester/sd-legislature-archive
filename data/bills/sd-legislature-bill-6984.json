The court may waive the prohibition on appointing an individual as guardian or conservator because of the individual's employment if the court finds the appointment is in the best interest of the minor or protected person.

The record check results, or the lack thereof, shall be certified by affidavit. The court may not require a record check upon the application of a petitioner for a temporary guardianship or temporary conservatorship. The court may waive the record check for good cause shown. Section 40. That \u00a7 29A-5-111 be amended to read: 29A-5-111. The appointment of a guardian or conservator does not become effective nor may letters of guardianship or conservatorship issue until the guardian or conservator has filed an acceptance of office and any required bond. The court may not require the filing of a bond by a guardian except for good cause shown. The court shall determine whether the filing of a bond by a conservator is necessary.

The court may order additional bond or reduce bond whenever it considers such modification to be in the best interests of the minor, the protected person, or the estate. The surety or sureties of the bond must immediately serve notice to the court and to the minor, the protected person, or the estate if the bond is not renewed by the guardian or conservator."}, {"bill_id": 6984, "bill_version_id": 39947, "bill_version": "House Judiciary Engrossed", "bill_version_date": "2016-02-24T13:43:41.393-06:00", "bill_text": "FOR AN ACT ENTITLED, An Act to adopt the Elder Abuse Task Force's statutory recommendations in order to protect South Dakota seniors and adults with disabilities from abuse, neglect, and exploitation.

That chapter 22-46 be amended by adding a NEW SECTION to read: In addition to the damages prescribed in section 28 of this Act, the court may impose the following penalties: (1) Revoke, in whole or in part, any revocable: (a) Provision by the elder or adult with a disability that is contained in a governing instrument that confers a general or nongeneral power of appointment on the perpetrator; and (b) Nomination or appointment by the elder or adult with a disability that is contained in a governing instrument that nominates or appoints the perpetrator to serve in any fiduciary or representative capacity, including serving as a personal representative, executor, guardian, conservator, trustee, attorney in fact, or agent; (2) Sever the interests of the elder or adult with a disability and the perpetrator in any property that is held by them at the time of the violation as joint tenants with the right of survivorship and transform the interests of the elder or adult with a disability and the perpetrator into tenancies in common. To the extent that the perpetrator did not provide adequate consideration for the jointly held interest, the court may cause the person's interest in the subject property to be forfeited in whole or in part. Section 30. That chapter 22-46 be amended by adding a NEW SECTION to read: A severance pursuant to subdivision (2) of section 29 of this Act does not affect any third party interest in property that was acquired for value and in good faith reliance on apparent title by survivorship in the perpetrator unless a writing declaring the severance has been noted, registered, filed, or recorded in records that are appropriate to the kind and location of the property and that are relied on as evidence of ownership in the ordinary course of transactions involving that property. Section 31. That chapter 22-46 be amended by adding a NEW SECTION to read: If the court imposes a revocation pursuant to subdivision (1) of section 29 of this Act, provisions of the governing instrument shall be given effect as if the perpetrator disclaimed all provisions revoked by the court or, in the case of a revocation of a nomination in a fiduciary or representative capacity, the perpetrator predeceased the decedent. Section 32. That chapter 22-46 be amended by adding a NEW SECTION to read: The court may authorize remedies provided in section 14 of this Act for violations under section 28 of this Act or \u00a7 22-46-3. Section 33. That chapter 22-46 be amended by adding a NEW SECTION to read: The remedies provided in sections 28 to 32, inclusive, of this Act, are in addition to and cumulative with other legal and administrative remedies available to an elder or adult with a disability. Section 34. That \u00a7 59-7-2.1 be amended to read: 59-7-2.1. Notwithstanding \u00a7 59-7-2, if a principal designates another as the principal's attorney in fact or agent by a written power of attorney which contains the words \"This power of attorney shall not be affected by disability of the principal,\" or \"This power of attorney shall become effective upon the disability of the principal,\" or similar words showing the intent of the principal that the authority conferred is exercisable notwithstanding the principal's disability, the authority of the attorney in fact or agent is exercisable by the attorney in fact or agent as provided in the power on behalf of the principal notwithstanding any later disability or incapacity of the principal or later uncertainty as to whether or not the principal is dead or alive. The durable power of attorney must be signed by the principal or in the principal's conscious presence by another individual directed by the principal to sign the principal's name on the power of attorney. The signature must be witnessed by two other adult individuals or by a notary public. A power of attorney granted pursuant to this section may authorize the attorney-in-fact to consent to, to reject, or to withdraw consent for health care, including any care, service, or procedure to maintain, diagnose, or treat a person's physical or mental condition. Section 35. That chapter 59-7 be amended by adding a NEW SECTION to read: If a conservator of the principal is appointed after the occurrence of the disability or incapacity referred to in \u00a7 59-7-2.1, any power of attorney authorizing an agent to act on the principal's finances or estate is terminated at the time of the appointment and the person acting under the power of attorney shall account to the conservator rather than to the principal. Section 36. That chapter 59-7 be amended by adding a NEW SECTION to read: If, after a principal executes a power of attorney for health care pursuant to \u00a7 59-7-2.1, a court appoints a guardian of the principal's person, the power of attorney is terminated at the time of the appointment, but the guardian shall follow any provisions contained in the power of attorney for health care delineating the principal's wishes for medical and end-of-life care. Section 37. That \u00a7 29A-5-118 be amended to read: 29A-5-118. The appointment of a guardian or conservator of a protected person does not constitute a general finding of legal incompetence unless the court so orders, and the protected person shall otherwise retain all rights which have not been granted to the guardian or conservator, with the exception of the ability to create an agency and confer authority on another person to do any act that the protected person might do, pursuant to \u00a7 59-2-1. Unless prior authorization of the court is first obtained, a guardian or conservator may not change the residence of the minor or protected person to another state, terminate or consent to a termination of the minor's or protected person's parental rights, initiate a change in the minor's or protected person's marital status, or revoke or amend a durable power of attorney of which the protected person is the principal, except as provided in sections 35 and 36 of this Act. Section 38. That chapter 29A-5 be amended by adding a NEW SECTION to read: The State Bar of South Dakota shall prepare and approve training curricula for persons appointed as guardians and conservators. The training curricula shall include: (1) The rights of minors and protected persons under chapter 29A-5 and under the laws of the United States generally; (2) The duties and responsibilities of guardians and conservators; (3) Reporting requirements; (4) Least restrictive options in the areas of housing, medical care, and psychiatric care; and (5) Resources to assist guardians and conservators in fulfilling their duties. Each person appointed by the court to be a guardian or conservator must complete the training curricula within four months after the appointment as a guardian or conservator. Section 39. That \u00a7 29A-5-110 be amended to read: 29A-5-110. Any adult individual may be appointed as a guardian, a conservator, or both, if capable of providing an active and suitable program of guardianship or conservatorship for the minor or protected person, and if not employed by any public or private agency, entity, or facility that is providing substantial services or financial assistance to the minor or protected person. The court may waive the prohibition on appointing an individual as guardian or conservator because of the individual's employment if the court finds the appointment is in the best interest of the minor or protected person. Any public agency or nonprofit corporation may be appointed as a guardian, a conservator, or both, if it is capable of providing an active and suitable program of guardianship or conservatorship for the minor or protected person, and if it is not providing substantial services or financial assistance to the minor or protected person. Any bank or trust company authorized to exercise trust powers or to engage in trust business in this state may be appointed as a conservator if it is capable of providing a suitable program of conservatorship for the minor or protected person. The Department of Human Services or the Department of Social Services may be appointed as a guardian, a conservator, or both, for individuals under its care or to whom it is providing services or financial assistance, but such appointment may only be made if there is no individual, nonprofit corporation, bank or trust company, or other public agency that is qualified and willing to serve. No individual or entity, other than a bank or trust company, whose only interest is that of a creditor, is eligible for appointment as either a guardian or conservator. No individual who has been convicted of a felony is eligible for appointment as a guardian or conservator unless the court finds appointment of the person convicted of a felony to be in the best interests of the person for whom the guardianship or conservatorship is sought. As part of the best interest determination, the court shall consider the nature of the offense, the date of offense, and the evidence of the proposed guardian's or proposed conservator's rehabilitation. A person, except for a financial institution or its officers, directors, employees, or agents, or a trust company, who has been nominated for appointment as a guardian or conservator, shall obtain an Interstate Identification Index criminal history record check and a record check of South Dakota state court civil judgments for abuse, neglect, or exploitation of an elder or adult with a disability. The nominee shall file the results of these record checks with the court at least ten days prior to the appointment hearing date, unless waived or modified by the court for good cause shown by affidavit filed simultaneously with the petition for appointment. The judge may not sign an order appointing a guardian or conservator until the record check results have been filed with the court and reviewed by the judge. The record check results, or the lack thereof, shall be certified by affidavit. The court may not require a record check upon the application of a petitioner for a temporary guardianship or temporary conservatorship. The court may waive the record check for good cause shown. Section 40. That \u00a7 29A-5-111 be amended to read: 29A-5-111. The appointment of a guardian or conservator does not become effective nor may letters of guardianship or conservatorship issue until the guardian or conservator has filed an acceptance of office and any required bond. The court may not require the filing of a bond by a guardian except for good cause shown. The court shall determine whether the filing of a bond by a conservator is necessary. In determining the necessity for or amount of a conservator's bond, the court shall consider: (1) The value of the personal estate and annual gross income and other receipts within the conservator's control; (2) The extent to which the estate has been deposited under an arrangement requiring an order of court for its removal; (3) Whether an order has been entered waiving the requirement that accountings be filed and presented or permitting accountings to be filed less frequently than annually; (4) The extent to which the income and receipts are payable directly to a facility responsible for or which has assumed responsibility for the care or custody of the minor or protected person; (5) Whether a guardian has been appointed, and if so, whether the guardian has presented reports as required; (6) Whether the conservator was appointed pursuant to a nomination which requested that bond be waived; and (7) Any other factors which the court deems appropriate. Any required bond shall be with such surety and in such amount and form as the court may order. The court may order additional bond or reduce bond whenever it considers such modification to be in the best interests of the minor, the protected person, or the estate. The surety or sureties of the bond must immediately serve notice to the court and to the minor, the protected person, or the estate if the bond is not renewed by the guardian or conservator."},
