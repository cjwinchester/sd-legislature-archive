WHEREAS, the Congress of the United States passed new farm legislation through the Agricultural Marketing Transition Act (AMTA) of 1996, otherwise known as the Freedom to Farm Bill, which completely decoupled farm commodity payments from farm production by implementing fixed payments over a seven year period; and WHEREAS, the fixed payments are fiscally irresponsible because they provide payments to producers at a time when much improved commodity prices would not otherwise merit such payment; and WHEREAS, the new farm policy nearly eliminates risk management and protection opportunities for farmers by stripping out any safety net designed to protect farmers during times of adverse conditions; and WHEREAS, certain elements of the Freedom to Farm Bill, including greater planting flexibility and less burdensome paperwork, having significantly contributed to a more successful farm policy, and therefore should remain a part of the overall farm program; and WHEREAS, states like South Dakota depend on the economic vitality of agriculture as our number one industry, an industry that contributes fifteen billion dollars in economic activity, an industry that thrives because of the many farm and ranch families. However, the livelihood of these farmers and ranchers are threatened by several factors they have no control over; and WHEREAS, the disastrous weather conditions of 1997 reminded farmers, ranchers, and South Dakotans that a safety net is necessary to aid farmers and ranchers that sustain rural communities, complicated by the fact that South Dakota has not yet felt the full impact or economic loss of the 1997 blizzards to farmers, ranchers, and rural communities: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the House of Representatives of the Seventy- third Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the Senate concurring therein, that the South Dakota Legislature encourages the United States Congress and the Clinton administration to make improvements to the current farm bill in such a way that replaces fixed, phased-out payments with a marketing-loan approach that provides risk management tools to farmers while at the same time establishes a safety-net within the farm program."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 13830, "action_date": "1998-01-29T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 76600, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/76600.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 586, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 13830, "action_date": "1998-01-29T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 76600, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/76600.pdf", "status_text": "Adopt Resolution", "journal_page": 294, "committee_id_action": 586, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 39993, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [2101, 2160, 2144, 2173, 2194, 2195, 2108, 2157, 2158, 2181], "Nay": [2110], "Excused": [2119, 2190]}}, {"bill_id": 13830, "action_date": "1998-01-30T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 76909, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/76909.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to another day", "journal_page": 319, "committee_id_action": 600, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 13830, "action_date": "1998-02-02T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 76911, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/76911.pdf", "status_text": "Adopt Resolution", "journal_page": 335, "committee_id_action": 600, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "F", "vote": {"vote_id": 40501, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [2096, 2098, 2100, 2101, 2104, 2105, 2106, 2114, 2116, 2117, 2119, 2120, 2124, 2126, 2128, 2131, 2139, 2141, 2143, 2144, 2146, 2151, 2153, 2160, 2161, 2162, 2168, 2171, 2172, 2173, 2176, 2178, 2183, 2185, 2190, 2195, 2197, 2198, 2134], "Yea": [2097, 2107, 2108, 2109, 2111, 2113, 2123, 2127, 2132, 2133, 2136, 2147, 2150, 2152, 2154, 2157, 2158, 2159, 2163, 2164, 2167, 2174, 2177, 2180, 2181, 2186, 2192, 2193, 2194], "Excused": [2110, 2184]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/13830"}
