BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. There is hereby created in the Department of Education the education stabilization fund. All moneys in the education stabilization fund are subject to appropriation by the Legislature through the General Appropriations Act or special appropriations acts to provide funding to school districts pursuant to this Act. Any interest earned shall be credited to the fund. Section 2. There is hereby appropriated from the education enhancement trust fund the sum of twenty million dollars ($20,000,000), or so much thereof as may be necessary, to the education stabilization fund to provide ten million dollars in fiscal year 2012 and ten million dollars in fiscal year 2013 to fund foundation program state aid pursuant to chapter 13-13. Section 3. For fiscal years 2012 and 2013, the amount of state funding per year to which all school districts are entitled under the foundation funding formula pursuant to chapter 13-13 shall be reduced by ten million dollars with an equal amount of funding per fall enrollment being deducted from the amount of money to which each school district is entitled. Each school district's share of the reduction shall be deducted in equal installments from the twelve payments the school district receives in state aid funding during each fiscal year pursuant to \u00a7 13-13-74. Section 4. That subdivision (4) of \u00a7 13-13-10.1 be amended to read as follows: (4) \"Per student allocation,\" for school fiscal year 2011 years 2012 and 2013 is $4,804.60. Each school fiscal year thereafter, the per student allocation is the previous fiscal year's per student allocation increased by the index factor; Section 5. That chapter 10-12 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Notwithstanding the provisions of \u00a7 10-12-43, no school district may originally impose or subsequently increase an excess tax levy for the period of time beginning on July 1, 2011 and ending on June 30, 2013. Section 6. Beginning in school fiscal year 2014, the total amount by which state funding to school districts is reduced in school fiscal years 2012 and 2013 shall be paid to school districts with funds from the education stabilization fund. Each school district is entitled to receive an amount equal to the total amount deducted from its foundation formula payments pursuant to section 3 of this Act. One-third of the amount to which each school district is entitled shall be paid per year in school fiscal years 2014, 2015, and 2016, and the accrued interest remaining in the education stabilization fund at the end of each of those three fiscal years shall be distributed following the end of each of those years to the school districts receiving payments pursuant to this section on a per fall enrollment basis. The payments made to school districts pursuant to this section are in addition to any payments the school district is entitled to receive under the foundation funding formula. Section 7. If, in any fiscal year, an amount of state funding per student is either added to or deducted from the amount of state funding to which a student is entitled under the foundation funding formula pursuant to chapter 13-13, any contract that the school district may have that is contingent upon the per student allocation as defined in \u00a7 13-13-10.1 shall instead be contingent upon the actual amount of state funding per student that is received by the school district in that fiscal year."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 2421, "action_date": "2011-01-25T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 15625, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/15625.pdf", "status_text": "First read in Senate and referred to", "journal_page": 197, "committee_id_action": 113, "committee_id_assigned": 91, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 2421, "action_date": "2011-02-08T08:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 16288, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/16288.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 91, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 2421, "action_date": "2011-02-08T08:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 16498, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/16498.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass", "journal_page": 350, "committee_id_action": 91, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 8721, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [30, 26, 52, 77, 24], "Nay": [82, 27]}}, {"bill_id": 2421, "action_date": "2011-02-09T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 16639, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/16639.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to another day", "journal_page": 379, "committee_id_action": 113, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 2421, "action_date": "2011-02-10T13:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 16730, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/16730.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to another day", "journal_page": 402, "committee_id_action": 113, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 2421, "action_date": "2011-02-14T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 16827, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/16827.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to another day", "journal_page": 417, "committee_id_action": 113, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 2421, "action_date": "2011-02-15T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 16915, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/16915.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to another day", "journal_page": 433, "committee_id_action": 113, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 2421, "action_date": "2011-02-16T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 17018, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/17018.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to another day", "journal_page": 451, "committee_id_action": 113, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 2421, "action_date": "2011-02-17T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 17099, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/17099.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to another day", "journal_page": 470, "committee_id_action": 113, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 2421, "action_date": "2011-02-22T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 17209, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/17209.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to another day", "journal_page": 483, "committee_id_action": 113, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 2421, "action_date": "2011-02-23T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 17282, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/17282.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass", "journal_page": 502, "committee_id_action": 113, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "F", "vote": {"vote_id": 9393, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [44, 75, 30, 79, 40, 24, 2, 77, 13, 55, 80], "Nay": [42, 46, 41, 26, 25, 38, 78, 76, 18, 82, 31, 43, 4, 16, 9, 10, 19, 81, 27, 34, 52, 8, 45, 22]}}]}
