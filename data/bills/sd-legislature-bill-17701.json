BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 32-22-16.3 be amended to read as follows: 32-22-16.3. No vehicle hauling agricultural products from farm storage or livestock from a farm is subject to enforcement action for violations not exceeding the legal limits imposed pursuant to \u00a7 32-22-16 or 32-22-21 by more than five percent. However, such vehicle may not exceed the speed of fifty miles per hour and is only exempt pursuant to this section within a range of fifty one hundred miles of the farm. Such vehicle may not exceed the posted weight of any bridge or road. The weight tolerance authorized in this section is not applicable during spring load restrictions as set forth in \u00a7 32-22-24. If enforcement action is taken pursuant to this section, the fine or penalty shall apply to that portion of the load that is above the legal limit. The weight tolerance authorized in this section is not permitted on the interstate highway system. A violation of this section is a Class 2 misdemeanor. 350 copies of this document were printed by the South Dakota Legislative Research Council at a cost of $.027 per page. .
