Section 5. Any person desiring to claim a refund pursuant to this Act shall apply for a permit from the secretary prior to or within ninety days after the construction date. The application for a permit shall be submitted on a form prescribed by the secretary. A separate application shall be made and submitted for each project. Upon approval of the application, the secretary shall issue a permit entitling the applicant to submit refund claims as provided by sections 6 and 7 of this Act. Such permit or refund claims are not assignable or transferable except as collateral or security pursuant to chapter 57A-9.

No document or record in support of any claim for refund may be considered by the department if the document or record in support of any claim for refund is received twelve months after the thirty-six month time period of section 4 of this Act. Moreover, any such document or record is barred from any future consideration. However, if the department requests any additional document or record from the project owner after a review of the claim for refund, and the request is made after the applicable time period provided by this section has expired, the project owner has sixty days to provide the requested document or record.

The amounts withheld by the department in accordance with section 7 of this Act shall be retained until the project has been completed and the claimant has met all the conditions of this Act, at which time all sums retained shall be paid to claimant. Section 11. If any claim has been fraudulently presented or supported as to any item in the claim, or if the claimant fails to meet all the conditions of this Act, then the claim may be rejected in its entirety and all sums previously refunded to the claimant shall constitute a debt to the state and a lien in favor of the state upon all property and rights to property whether real or personal belonging to the claimant and may be recovered in an action of debt. Section 12. Any person aggrieved by the denial in whole or in part of a refund claimed under this Act, may within thirty days after service of the notice of such denial by the secretary, demand and be entitled to a hearing, upon notice, before the secretary. The hearing shall be conducted pursuant to chapter 1-26. Section 13. Any amount refunded pursuant to this Act for a project that is not completed within the time frames prescribed in this Act, including any extensions granted by the secretary, shall be returned to the state without interest. Any refunded amounts not returned pursuant to this section and all sums previously refunded to the claimant constitute a debt to the state and a lien in favor of the state upon all property and rights to property whether real or personal belonging to the claimant and may be recovered in an action of debt. Section 14. Any person aggrieved by a decision of the secretary under this Act may, within thirty days of receipt of written notice of the secretary's decision, make written application to the secretary for a hearing to be conducted pursuant to chapter 1-26. Hearings are to be conducted and appeals taken pursuant to the provisions of chapters 1-26 and 1-26D. A copy of the hearing examiner's proposed decision, findings of fact, and conclusions of law shall be served on all parties when furnished to the secretary. If the secretary, pursuant to chapter 1-26D, accepts the final decision of the hearing examiner, no appeal from a final decision of the secretary upon any additional tax to be paid may be taken unless any amount ordered paid by the secretary is paid or a bond filed to insure payment of the amount. However, if the final decision of the secretary, pursuant to chapter 1-26D, rejects or modifies the decision of the hearing examiner regarding the amount due, an appeal may be taken without payment of the amount ordered to be paid and without filing of a bond. If the secretary's decision is affirmed by the circuit court, no appeal may be taken unless any amount ordered to be paid by the secretary is paid or a bond is filed to insure payment of such amount. Section 15. The secretary shall promulgate rules, pursuant to chapter 1-26, concerning the procedures for filing refund claims and the requirements necessary to qualify for a refund. Section 16. If the project is located on land that is included within the agreement area of a tax collection agreement entered into by the state and an Indian tribe pursuant to chapter 10-12A, the department is only obligated to pay a percentage of the refund as required by this Act equal to the percentage of funds that the department retains pursuant to the terms of the tax collection agreement. Section 17. The name of any person or entity that receives a refund or credit of sales, use, or contractors excise tax pursuant to this Act and the amount of any such refund or credit is public information and shall be available and open to public inspection as provided in \u00a7 1-27-1.

The company shall apply for the rebate on forms prescribed by the secretary. The total amount of tax rebated shall be no more than fifty percent of the cost of the transmission lines and wind farm collector systems in South Dakota. The maximum rebate any company may receive in one year is ninety percent of the tax paid under \u00a7 10-35-19 for the first five years and fifty percent of the tax paid under \u00a7 10-35-19 for the next five years. The secretary shall determine when the wind farm is commercially operational. However, if the company received a refund pursuant to sections 1 to 17, inclusive, of this Act, the maximum rebate any company may receive in one year is fifteen percent of the tax paid under \u00a7 10-35-19 for the first five years and fifteen percent of the tax paid under \u00a7 10-35-19 for the next five years. No wind farm may receive a rebate under this section after this ten year period. The secretary shall rebate the tax from the wind energy tax fund prior to the distribution of any money as provided in \u00a7 10-35-21. The secretary may provide a tax credit, in lieu of full payment of the gross receipts tax, of up to eighty percent of the transmission rebate value that has been approved by the secretary. Any revenue in the wind energy tax fund after the rebates are paid shall be deposited in the property tax reduction fund. Section 19. Whereas, this Act is necessary for the support of the state government and its existing public institutions, an emergency is hereby declared to exist, and this Act shall be in full force and effect from and after its passage and approval."}, {"bill_id": 4287, "bill_version_id": 25754, "bill_version": "Senate Commerce and Energy Engrossed", "bill_version_date": "2013-02-14T13:28:46.473-06:00", "bill_text": "FOR AN ACT ENTITLED, An Act to establish certain incentives for wind energy facilities, to revise the amount that may be rebated for the gross receipts tax on electricity produced on wind farms, to provide a penalty for filing a false affidavit, and to declare an emergency.

If a wind farm is located in more than one county, each county shall receive the same percentage of the tax as the percentage of wind towers in the wind farm located in the county. Upon receipt of the taxes, the county auditor shall apportion the tax among all taxing jurisdictions the school districts, the county, and the organized townships where a wind tower is located. The tax shall be apportioned in the same manner as agricultural real property taxes would have been apportioned between the taxing jurisdictions by the county auditor by allocating fifty percent of the tax to the school district where each wind tower is located, fifteen percent to the organized township where each wind tower is located, and thirty-five percent to the county. If a wind tower is located in a township that is not organized, the unorganized township's share of the tax for that wind tower is allocated to the county. The secretary shall distribute the money to the counties on or before the first day of May. Section 17.
