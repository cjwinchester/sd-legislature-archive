Section 2. That \u00a7 62-4-34 be amended to read as follows: 62-4-34. If an employee of an insured employer who has previously sustained an injury, or suffers from a preexisting condition, receives a subsequent compensable injury resulting in additional permanent partial or permanent total disability so that the degree or percentage of disability caused by the combination of the subsequent injury and the preexisting injury or condition is substantially greater than that which resulted from the last injury, considered alone, and if the employee of an insured employer is entitled to receive compensation on the basis of the combined disabilities, the insured employer , or its insurance carrier, shall pay all medical and hospital expenses and compensation provided by this title. The insured employer , or its insurance carrier, shall be reimbursed from the \" subsequent injury fund \" for two-thirds of all compensation, medical and hospital expenses paid to or on behalf of the injured employee of the insured employer due to the subsequent injury. If the subsequent compensable injury of the employee of an insured employer results in the death of the employee and it has been determined that the death would not have occurred except for the preexisting disability, the insured employer , or its insurance carrier, shall pay all compensation provided by this title. Section 3. That \u00a7 62-4-34.4 be amended to read as follows: 62-4-34.4.

In case of the death of an employee covered by this title, if no person is entitled to compensation, the employer, or if insured, the employer's insurance carrier , shall pay to the Division of Insurance the sum of five hundred dollars to be deposited in the subsequent injury fund. The Division of Insurance shall assess each insurance carrier of every employer , or every employer, if self-insured, an amount equal to four percent of all workers' compensation, including medical, hospital, and indemnity expenses, paid to or on behalf of an injured employee during the calendar year next preceding the due date of the payments, which shall be deposited in the subsequent injury fund. The assessment shall be made at any time the fund falls below two hundred thousand dollars. The payment shall be made immediately upon notification to the carrier or self-insured by the division. Each insurance carrier of every employer , or every employer, if self-insured, shall be required to participate in the subsequent injury fund and pay assessments except as provided in \u00a7 62-4-34.6 and section 1 of this Act . Failure of an insurance carrier of an employer , or an employer, if self-insured, to respond within twenty days of receipt to a notice of assessment from the Division of Insurance shall, unless good cause is shown, have the effect of making that insurance carrier of an employer or a self-insured employer ineligible for reimbursement from the subsequent injury fund for any subsequent injury incurred or claim made from the date the assessment is made for a period of one year subsequent to the date the assessment is actually paid. Failure of an insurance carrier of an employer , or an employer, if self-insured, to pay an assessment other than for good cause shown, shall also be grounds for administrative action to be taken by the division or department against an insurance carrier of an employer or an employer, if self-insured, concerning their status and authority to continue being authorized insurance carriers or self-insured employers in the State of South Dakota. Section 5. That \u00a7 62-4-36.3 be repealed. 62-4-36.3. If the Division of Insurance determines that administrative action is necessary against the continued authorization of the status and authority of a self-insured employer for failure to pay an assessment other than for good cause shown, and that self-insured employer has been issued a certificate of exemption by the Department of Labor pursuant to \u00a7 62-5-5, the division shall commence administrative action by petitioning the department for a hearing. The hearing shall be conducted by a hearing examiner appointed by the secretary of labor. The attorney general or counsel for the division shall represent the subsequent injury fund. The hearing shall be conducted pursuant to the provisions of chapter 1-26. Section 6. That \u00a7 62-5-5 be amended to read as follows: 62-5-5. If an employer coming under the provisions of this title annually furnishes satisfactory proof to the Department of Labor of the employer's solvency and financial ability to pay the compensation required by this title, the employer is relieved from the provisions of \u00a7 62-5-1. Each employer shall submit an application fee not to exceed two thousand dollars to the Department of Labor at the time proof of solvency is submitted. The Department of Labor shall set, by rules promulgated pursuant to chapter 1-26, the amount of the application fee. All fees paid to the department pursuant to this section shall be deposited with the state treasurer and shall be credited to the Department of Labor Special Revenue Fund which is hereby created. The money deposited shall be dedicated and continuously appropriated to the department for purposes of conducting an actuarial review of the applicant's financial condition and automating the administration of the workers' compensation law. Upon receiving satisfactory proof of financial solvency and surety for performance required by \u00a7 62-5-10, the department shall issue a certificate of exemption relieving the employer of the obligation to purchase worker's compensation insurance provided in \u00a7 \u00a7 62-5-2 and 62-5-3. The department may revoke this certificate if the employer fails to comply with the provisions of titles 58 and title 62, or with any rules promulgated by the Department of Labor."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 12581, "action_date": "1997-01-14T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 72866, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/72866.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 32, "committee_id_action": 544, "committee_id_assigned": 542, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 12581, "action_date": "1997-01-17T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 72169, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/72169.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to another day", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 542, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 12581, "action_date": "1997-01-24T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 72208, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/72208.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to 41st legislative day", "journal_page": 108, "committee_id_action": 542, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 37716, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [1931, 1924, 1892, 1894, 1903, 1910, 1918, 1951, 1968, 1898, 1922, 1982], "Nay": [1954]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/12581"}
