WHEREAS, the federal government, state and local governments, communities, and electric power providers have a common interest in assuring compliance with our nation's air quality goals; and WHEREAS, South Dakota is one of only eleven states to meet all of the federal government's ambient air quality standards; and WHEREAS, the Big Stone Power Plant near Big Stone City, South Dakota, is helping to maintain South Dakota's clean air by working with the United States Department of Energy to install and operate an advanced hybrid particulate collector that collects 99.99 percent of the particulate emitted by its coal-fired boiler; and WHEREAS, the South Dakota Legislature is desirous of developing the state's natural resources in an environmentally responsible manner for the benefit of all its citizens; and WHEREAS, electric power providers have significantly reduced air emissions, but additional reductions are needed to help address these air quality goals; and WHEREAS, the Clean Air Act provides for continued reductions in emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and mercury from electric power facilities with numerous regulatory decisions mandated over the next two decades that will have unpredictable outcomes; and WHEREAS, implementation of the Clean Air Act's multiple, overlapping requirements could be streamlined to facilitate greater, more efficient, and more certain emission reductions that would reduce litigation that often causes significant delays in achieving air quality goals; and WHEREAS, an opportunity (in the form of the Clear Skies Initiative) exists to adopt a federal, integrated strategy that establishes aggressive, but reasonable, timeframes and reduction targets for the nation's three highest-priority electric power plant emissions _ sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and mercury; and WHEREAS, such a multi-emission strategy will minimize interstate regulatory compliance conflicts, lessen the need for costly, time-consuming litigation, allow for the design and deployment of more cost-effective technologies, and continue the nation's progress for reducing potentially harmful emissions in as cost-effective manner as possible without negatively impacting the reliability of the nation's electric power supplies: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the House of Representatives of the Eightieth Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the Senate concurring therein, that the South Dakota Legislature calls upon South Dakota's Congressional delegation and the United States Congress to pass multi-emission legislation in 2005 that significantly reduces emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and mercury from electric power generators and helps the nation toward attainment of federal air quality standards without exacerbating imbalances in the natural gas market; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the final multi-emission reduction program should maintain and encourage a diverse fuel supply that will benefit states and local communities, consumers, and manufacturers, as well as maintain and promote electric power reliability, availability, and affordability; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that reductions under such a program should be achieved using an emissions cap-and-trade approach patterned after the successful Clean Air Act acid rain program; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the ongoing development of combined heat and power units be encouraged by exempting energy efficient and low-emitting units from multi-emission legislation and allowing them to opt into the program; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that such a program should streamline Clean Air Act provisions given that sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and mercury emissions caps will substantially reduce the amount of emissions from electric power facilities; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that such a program should require strict enforcement by the United States Environmental Protection Agency and strict fines for violations; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the South Dakota Legislature supports the Clear Skies Initiative if the final version does not contain carbon dioxide emission regulations or standards, and that the goal of carbon dioxide emission reductions instead be supported through research and encouraged on a voluntary basis."}, {"bill_id": 20056, "bill_version_id": 105840, "bill_version": "Enrolled", "bill_version_date": "2005-03-03T15:32:59-06:00", "bill_text": ""}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 20056, "action_date": "2005-02-28T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 105579, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/105579.pdf", "status_text": "Introduced", "journal_page": 684, "committee_id_action": 860, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 20056, "action_date": "2005-03-01T13:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 105710, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/105710.pdf", "status_text": "Adopt Resolution", "journal_page": 713, "committee_id_action": 860, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 62152, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [3155, 3158, 3159, 3160, 3161, 3162, 3164, 3167, 3169, 3170, 3171, 3172, 3174, 3175, 3176, 3177, 3178, 3181, 3182, 3183, 3184, 3187, 3188, 3189, 3190, 3191, 3192, 3194, 3195, 3196, 3197, 3199, 3203, 3206, 3207, 3208, 3209, 3211, 3213, 3216, 3218, 3220, 3222, 3223, 3225, 3226, 3227, 3229, 3230, 3231, 3232, 3233, 3234, 3235, 3237, 3238, 3240, 3243, 3244, 3245, 3246, 3248, 3249, 3251, 3252, 3253, 3254, 3255, 3215], "Excused": [3156]}}, {"bill_id": 20056, "action_date": "2005-03-02T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 105739, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/105739.pdf", "status_text": "Introduced", "journal_page": 738, "committee_id_action": 861, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 20056, "action_date": "2005-03-03T09:30:00-06:00", "document_id": 105846, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/105846.pdf", "status_text": "Concur In resolution", "journal_page": 756, "committee_id_action": 861, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 60797, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [3150, 3151, 3152, 3154, 3157, 3163, 3165, 3166, 3179, 3180, 3185, 3193, 3198, 3200, 3201, 3202, 3204, 3205, 3210, 3212, 3214, 3217, 3224, 3228, 3236, 3241, 3247], "Excused": [3153, 3168, 3173, 3186, 3219, 3221, 3239, 3242]}}]}
