The report shall be in the form of a supplementary return and shall be filed within one hundred twenty days of the final adjustment by the United States. Any additional tax due and applicable interest shall be paid at the time of filing the supplementary return. The provisions of this section apply notwithstanding the limitation period for collection of taxes provided under \u00a7 10-59-16. Section 2. That chapter 10-43 be amended by adding a NEW SECTION to read: A taxpayer who has filed a return with the department for a specific tax year and subsequently has a change or correction to the taxpayer's net income, as a result of audit or adjustment by the United States, that decreases the taxpayer's taxable income in this state, may report the change or correction in writing to the secretary. The report shall be in the form of a supplementary return and shall be filed within one hundred twenty days of the final adjustment by the United States.

The provisions of this section apply notwithstanding \u00a7\u00a7 10-59-17 and 10-59-19. No court has jurisdiction of a suit to recover the taxes, penalties, or interest unless the taxpayer seeking the recovery of the tax complies with the provisions of this section. Section 3.

The secretary may also impose a penalty of five thousand dollars or ten percent of the additional tax due, whichever is greater, for failure to timely file a supplementary return and pay any additional tax and applicable interest as required by section 1 of this Act. This penalty is in addition to all other penalties provided by law and shall be deposited in the state general fund. Section 4. That \u00a7 10-43-50 be repealed. 10-43-50. As soon as practicable and in any event within three years after the return is filed, the secretary of revenue shall examine it and determine the correct amount of tax, and the amount so determined by the secretary is the tax.

Section 5. That \u00a7 10-43-51 be repealed. 10-43-51. If the secretary of revenue discovers from the examination of the return or otherwise that the income of the taxpayer, or any portion of the income, has not been listed in the return, or that no return was filed when one was due, the secretary may at any time within five years after the time when the return was due, determine the correct amount of the tax together with interest and penalty as provided in \u00a7 10-59-6. The tax, interest, and penalty shall be paid within ten days after the secretary of revenue has given notice of the tax, interest, and penalty to the taxpayer by registered or certified mail. Section 6. That \u00a7 10-43-51.1 be repealed. 10-43-51.1.

Section 7. That \u00a7 10-43-55 be repealed. 10-43-55.

Section 8. That \u00a7 10-43-60 be repealed. 10-43-60.

When the taxpayer has filed a return with the department for the tax year and a subsequent increase occurs in the taxpayer's net income or taxable income for that tax year, whether because of audit and adjustment by the United States or otherwise, the taxpayer shall file a supplementary return with the department for the tax year in which the income was earned. The return must be filed within 60 days after the final determination of the increase in income. A supplementary return need not be filed if the increase in the taxpayer's income is the result of an adjustment in the original return by the department. Section 10. That ARSD 64:26:02:06 be repealed. 64:26:02:06. Supplementary return permitted upon subsequent decrease in income -- Exception if decrease results from departmental adjustment. When the taxpayer has filed a return with the department for the tax year and a subsequent decrease occurs in the taxpayer's net income or taxable income for that tax year, whether because of audit and adjustment by the United States or otherwise, the taxpayer may file a supplementary return with the department for the tax year in which the decrease occurred. A supplementary return need not be filed if the decrease is the result of an adjustment in the original return by the department. Section 11.
