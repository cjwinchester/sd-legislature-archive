BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 40-20-26 be amended to read as follows: 40-20-26. It is a Class 1 misdemeanor for any licensed livestock auction market in the livestock ownership inspection area to allow any livestock brought into the yards of the market for purpose of sale to leave the yards until first inspected for ownership. However, if a shipment of livestock arrives at any auction market in the ownership inspection area after daylight hours, facilities shall be made available to yard such livestock separate and apart from any other livestock. The auction market may sell such livestock that night, but livestock so sold shall be returned to the separate yard facilities, and may not be removed therefrom until an ownership inspection has been made. The livestock ownership inspector may, in his discretion, reinspect the livestock before they leave the yards of the auction market. Livestock that are brought into a livestock auction market located within the livestock ownership inspection area from a location outside the livestock ownership inspection area need not be inspected for ownership. 180 copies were printed on recycled paper by the South Dakota Legislative Research Council at a cost of $.063 per page. .
