BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 46-5-40.1 be amended to read: 46-5-40.1. The Water Management Board may promulgate rules to authorize the chief engineer to issue temporary permits for the use of public water for construction, testing, or drilling purposes. No temporary permit is valid after December thirty-one of the year in which the permit is issued. No temporary permit may be issued if the permit interferes with or adversely affects prior appropriations or vested rights. A temporary permit shall contain qualifications and limitations necessary to protect the public interest. The issuance of a temporary permit is permission to use public water on a temporary basis and does not grant any water rights. No temporary permit may be issued for testing or drilling to explore, seeking to develop, or actively mining natural resource deposits or fields. 100 copies were printed on recycled paper by the South Dakota Legislative Research Council at a cost of $.167 per page. .
