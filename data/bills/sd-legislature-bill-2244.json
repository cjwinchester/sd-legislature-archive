In such event, the real property thereafter shall be conveyed free and clear of such transfer fee and private transfer fee obligation. Section 10. That chapter 43-4 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: If the payee fails to provide a written statement of the transfer fee payable within thirty days of the date of a written request for such statement sent to the address shown in the notice of transfer fee, the grantor, on recording of the affidavit required under section 11 of this Act, may convey any interest in the real property to any grantee without payment of the transfer fee and is not subject to any further obligation under the private transfer fee obligation.
