The secretary shall distribute all of the tax deposited in the wind energy tax fund pursuant to \u00a7 10-35-18 and twenty percent of the tax deposited in the wind energy tax fund pursuant to \u00a7 10-35-19 to the county treasurer where the wind farm is located. If the wind energy tax fund contains less than twenty percent of the gross receipts tax from \u00a7 10-35-19, due to the transmission line rebate under \u00a7 10-35-22, the secretary shall distribute the remainder of funds after the rebate to the county treasurer where the wind farm is located. If a wind farm is located in more than one county, each county shall receive the same percentage of the tax as the percentage of wind towers in the wind farm located in the county. Upon receipt of the taxes, the county auditor shall apportion the tax among all taxing jurisdictions where a wind tower is located. The tax shall be apportioned in the same manner as agricultural real property taxes would have been apportioned between the taxing jurisdictions. However, the taxes shall be reapportioned to the township in which the wind farm is located based on the ratio of township road miles to county road miles within the township as specified in sections 2 and 3 of this Act. The secretary shall distribute the money to the counties on or before the first day of May. Section 2. That chapter 10-35 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: The taxes apportioned to the township in which the wind farm is located shall be based on the ratio of township road miles to county road miles within the township in which the wind farm is located as defined in section 3 of this Act. If the wind farm is located in more than one township, the percentage of taxes allocated to each township shall be equal to the percentage of wind towers in the wind farm located in each township. Section 3. That chapter 10-35 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: The county auditor shall total the taxes apportioned to each township in which the wind farm is located pursuant to \u00a7 10-35-21 and the taxes apportioned to the county for such township area to determine the sum of such taxes available for distribution. The county auditor shall divide the township road miles by the total of the township road miles plus county road miles within such township. This ratio shall be multiplied by the sum of taxes available for distribution and such amount shall be distributed to the township. The remaining balance shall be distributed to the county. However, no apportionment distributed to the township may exceed thirty percent of the sum of the taxes available for distribution pursuant to this Act."}, {"bill_id": 2627, "bill_version_id": 17076, "bill_version": "House Taxation Engrossed", "bill_version_date": "2011-02-17T12:08:21.743-06:00", "bill_text": "FOR AN ACT ENTITLED, An Act to modify the registration of certain anemometer towers used for wind energy testing purposes.

Any anemometer tower that is fifty feet in height above the ground or higher, that is located outside the exterior boundaries of any municipality, and whose appearance is not otherwise mandated by state or federal law shall be marked, painted, flagged, or otherwise constructed to be recognizable in clear air during daylight hours. Any anemometer tower that was erected before July 1, 2010 shall be marked as required in this section within one year after July 1, 2010. Any anemometer tower that is erected on or after July 1, 2010 shall be marked as required in this section at the time it is erected. Marking required under this section includes marking the anemometer tower, guy wires, and accessory facilities as follows: (1) The top one-third of the anemometer tower shall be painted in equal, alternating bands of aviation orange and white, beginning with orange at the top of the tower and ending with orange at the bottom of the marked portion of the tower; (2) Two marker balls shall be attached to and evenly spaced on each of the outside guy wires; (3) The area surrounding each point where a guy wire is anchored to the ground shall have a contrasting appearance with any surrounding vegetation. If the adjacent land is grazed, the area surrounding the anchor point shall be fenced. For purposes of this section, the term, area surrounding the anchor point, means an area not less than sixty-four square feet whose outer boundary is at least four feet from the anchor point; and (4) One or more seven-foot safety sleeves shall be placed at each anchor point and shall extend from the anchor point along each guy wire attached to the anchor point.

That chapter 50-9 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: The Aeronautics Commission shall establish and maintain a database to identify the locations of each existing anemometer tower. By January 1, 2012, each person with an anemometer tower erected in the state shall provide the commission with the global positioning coordinates of the center of each anemometer tower. Each person proposing to erect an anemometer tower shall provide to the commission the global positioning coordinates of the center of the tower at least fifteen days before the erection of the tower.
