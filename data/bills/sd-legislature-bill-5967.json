WHEREAS, Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), also known as chronic bronchitis and emphysema, is the third-leading cause of death in the United States and is the second-leading cause of disability; and WHEREAS, pulmonary experts predict that by 2020, COPD will become the leading cause of death worldwide; and WHEREAS, the major risk factor for COPD is smoking. Other risk factors include environmental and workplace exposure to air pollution, a history of childhood respiratory infection, and genetics; and WHEREAS, tobacco use is the single most preventable cause of death and disease in South Dakota; and WHEREAS, chronic lower respiratory disease accounted for six and six-tenths percent of 2012 South Dakota resident deaths, including emphysema, asthma, and bronchitis (2012 Vital Statistics); and WHEREAS, approximately 34,000 or five percent of South Dakota adults reported having COPD in 2012; and WHEREAS, the American Association for Respiratory Care reports that just over half of all persons with COPD report that their condition limits their ability to work, while thirty-four percent say that COPD keeps them from working; and WHEREAS, early COPD screening and diagnosis is critical, and a diagnostic test for COPD known as spirometry is available for office use, yet most people are not diagnosed until they have reached an advanced stage of COPD; and WHEREAS, until there is a cure for COPD, increased public awareness, early detection, and proper health management can slow the progression of the disease and lead to reduced costs and improved quality of life and self-sufficiency; and WHEREAS, the South Dakota Chronic Disease State Plan guides the statewide stakeholders working together on efforts to prevent and lessen the burden of chronic disease. The state plan identifies areas for collaboration to reduce cost, as well as increase the impact, of the efforts to improve the health of South Dakotans: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the House of Representatives of the Eighty-Ninth Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the Senate concurring therein, that COPD is recognized as a chronic health condition in South Dakota which contributes to increasing health care costs and decreasing productivity of it citizens; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Legislature encourages the South Dakota Department of Health to include COPD as a chronic health condition in its efforts to address serious and chronic health conditions in South Dakota by seeking out and applying for funding and grants available to provide public awareness or treatment for COPD in South Dakota; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Legislature encourages the South Dakota Department of Health to include COPD as a chronic health condition in its current efforts to educate the public about the effects of smoking and recognizes the Tobacco Control Program's goals to prevent youth initiation to tobacco products, eliminate exposure to secondhand smoke, and promote cessation among youth and young adults.
