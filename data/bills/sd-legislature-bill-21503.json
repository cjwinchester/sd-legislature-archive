WHEREAS, in 1935, the United States established, by law, that workers are free to form unions; and WHEREAS, the freedom to form or join a union is internationally recognized by the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights as a fundamental human right; and WHEREAS, the free choice to join with others and bargain for better wages and benefits is essential to economic opportunity and good living standards; and WHEREAS, unions benefit communities by strengthening living standards, stabilizing tax bases, promoting equal treatment, and enhancing civic participation; and WHEREAS, states in which more people are union members are states with higher wages, better benefits, and better schools; and WHEREAS, union workers receive better wages and benefits, earn twenty-nine percent more than workers without a union, are thirty-five percent more likely to have access to health insurance, and are four times more likely to have access to a guaranteed defined-benefit pension; and WHEREAS, workers across the nation are routinely denied the freedom to form unions and bargain for a better life, with twenty-five percent of private-sector employers illegally firing at least one worker for union activity during organizing campaigns; and WHEREAS, seventy-seven percent of the public believes it is important to have strong laws protecting the freedom for workers to make their own decision about having a union, and fifty- eight percent of workers would join a union if they had the chance; and WHEREAS, each year millions of dollars are spent to frustrate workers' efforts to form unions, and most violations of workers' freedom to choose a union occur behind closed doors, with seventy-eight percent of employers forcing employees to attend mandatory anti-union meetings; and WHEREAS, when the right of workers to form a union is violated, wages fall, race and gender pay gaps widen, workplace discrimination increases, and job safety standards disappear; and WHEREAS, a worker's fundamental right to choose a union free from coercion and intimidation is a public issue that requires public policy solutions, including legislative remedies; and WHEREAS, the Employee Free Choice Act has been introduced in the United States Congress in order to restore workers' freedom to join a union; and WHEREAS, the Employee Free Choice Act will safeguard workers' ability to make their own decisions with these abuses and establish meaningful penalties when employers violate workers' rights: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the Senate of the Eighty-second Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the House of Representatives concurring therein, that the State of South Dakota supports the Employee Free Choice Act which would authorize the National Labor Relations Board to certify a union as the bargaining representative when a majority of employees voluntarily sign authorizations designating that union to represent them and the Act would establish meaningful penalties for violations of a worker's freedom to choose a union; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that Congress is encouraged to pass the Employee Free Choice Act to protect and preserve for America's workers their freedom to choose for themselves whether or not to form a union."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 21503, "action_date": "2007-02-08T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 111822, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/111822.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 898, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 21503, "action_date": "2007-02-08T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 111822, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/111822.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass,", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 898, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "F", "vote": {"vote_id": 64832, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [3571, 3585, 3602, 3634], "Yea": [3623, 3627, 3667]}}, {"bill_id": 21503, "action_date": "2007-02-08T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 111822, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/111822.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to 41st legislative day", "journal_page": 436, "committee_id_action": 898, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 64833, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [3571, 3585, 3602, 3634], "Nay": [3623, 3627, 3667]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/21503"}
