WHEREAS, Sitting Bull was arguably one of the most powerful and famous of all Native American chiefs, and he united the Sioux Tribes in their struggle for survival on the North American Great Plains; and WHEREAS, the expanding American nation shaped the struggles of Sitting Bull's life; and WHEREAS, in 1868, he gained the respect of the Lakota people as both a leader and a warrior and earned the title of Chief of the Lakota Nation; and WHEREAS, during the mid-1870s, prospectors uncovered gold in the sacred Black Hills, land recognized in the 1868 Fort Laramie Treaty; and WHEREAS, the U.S. government abandoned the treaty and declared war on any native tribes standing in their way, including the Lakota and the steadfast Sitting Bull; and WHEREAS, Sitting Bull performed a sacred Sun Dance, slashed his arms in sacrifice, and deprived himself of drinking water before announcing his vision in which they defeated the U.S. Army; and WHEREAS, in June 1876, a short time later, he defended the massive Sioux encampment at Little Bighorn against an undermanned attacking General George Armstrong Custer and his 7th Calvary, securing a resounding victory for his people, but earning the anger of his enemies; and WHEREAS, the U.S. government increased its efforts to acquire control of the territory from native tribes; and WHEREAS, Sitting Bull retreated with his people to Canada for four years, avoiding the U.S. government's pursuit; and WHEREAS, when he returned to the Dakota Territory in 1881, he was captured and imprisoned for two years; and WHEREAS, in 1885, he teamed up with Annie Oakley and joined Buffalo Bill Cody's Wild West Show, where he earned fifty dollars per week to ride once around the arena, but life on the road became tiresome, so he returned to his people; and WHEREAS, in 1889, Sitting Bull headed a Native American Ghost Dance ceremony, which struck fear in authorities, who knew of his great power and influence; and WHEREAS, on December 15, 1890, a group of Lakota police entered his home on the Standing Rock Indian Reservation and dragged him out of his cabin; and WHEREAS, a gunfight ensued and resulted in the slaying of Sitting Bull, the renowned Lakota Chief; and WHEREAS, a memorial is placed at the reported burial site of Sitting Bull near Mobridge, South Dakota; and WHEREAS, Sitting Bull lived his life without compromise and stayed true to the Native American way of life as he fearlessly resisted the encroachment of the Dakota Territory by performing acts as a daring warrior and an eloquent statesman; and WHEREAS, the Native American people have served our country in times of peace and war, while also striving for equal rights; and WHEREAS, Native Americans serve in the U.S. military in greater numbers than any ethnic group per capita and have since the revolution, even though the United States did not recognize them as citizens until 1924; and WHEREAS, the Native American Code Talkers proved essential to the United States achieving victory in World Wars I and II; and WHEREAS, countless additional Native Americans have fought for our freedoms we hold dear; and WHEREAS, twenty-seven Native Americans have earned the nation's highest military honor, the Medal of Honor; and WHEREAS, this demonstration of American patriotism, love of country and warrior spirit can be appropriately attributed in part to the leadership example of one of South Dakota's most famous sons, Sitting Bull: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the House of Representatives of the Ninety-Second Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the Senate concurring therein, that the South Dakota Legislature does hereby posthumously remember and honor Sitting Bull, Tatanka-Iyotanka, the legendary chief, statesman, and warrior, who bravely and selflessly defended his people and their traditional way of life with all of his being; as well as the many South Dakota Native Americans who continue to embody the spirit of one of South Dakota's most illustrious native sons."}, {"bill_id": 8281, "bill_version_id": 45235, "bill_version": "Enrolled", "bill_version_date": "2017-03-01T10:03:40.91-06:00", "bill_text": ""}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 8281, "action_date": "2017-02-23T13:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 44897, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/44897.pdf", "status_text": "First Reading", "journal_page": 488, "committee_id_action": 361, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 8281, "action_date": "2017-02-24T13:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 44986, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/44986.pdf", "status_text": "Adopt Resolution", "journal_page": 532, "committee_id_action": 361, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 23727, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [1168, 1153, 1186, 1166, 1147, 1122, 1118, 1180, 1197, 1190, 1183, 1114, 1198, 1116, 1129, 1143, 1142, 1136, 1139, 1181, 1204, 1159, 1192, 1196, 1120, 1205, 1130, 1191, 1185, 1200, 1206, 1124, 1170, 1110, 1184, 1134, 1160, 1193, 1199, 1165, 1155, 1188, 1119, 1156, 1115, 1123, 1161, 1152, 1140, 1158, 1176, 1128, 1145, 1111, 1187, 1150, 1149], "Excused": [1112, 1173, 1179, 1201, 1202, 1117, 1133, 1125, 1203, 1113, 1195, 1121, 1212]}}, {"bill_id": 8281, "action_date": "2017-02-27T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 45069, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/45069.pdf", "status_text": "First Reading", "journal_page": 572, "committee_id_action": 360, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 8281, "action_date": "2017-02-28T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 45169, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/45169.pdf", "status_text": "Concurred in Resolution", "journal_page": 584, "committee_id_action": 360, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 23849, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [1154, 1171, 1103, 1108, 1096, 1097, 1109, 1105, 1175, 1100, 1106, 1164, 1194, 1107, 1104, 1163, 1099, 1144, 1131, 1135, 1178, 1141, 1157, 1172, 1151, 1174, 1146, 1102, 1098, 1137, 1167, 1132, 1189], "Excused": [1148, 1169]}}]}
