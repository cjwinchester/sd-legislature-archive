Notwithstanding any other law, any action arising under section 2 this Act is governed by the procedural and substantive law of this state. Any action for riot boosting shall be for the exclusive benefit of the state, political subdivision, or an otherwise damaged third party, and shall be brought in the name of the state or political subdivision.

The fund is continuously appropriated to the Department of Public Safety, which shall administer the fund. All money received by the department for the fund shall be set forth in an informational budget pursuant to \u00a7 4-7-7.2 and be annually reviewed by the Legislature. The secretary shall approve vouchers and the state auditor shall draw warrants to pay any claim authorized by this Act. Any civil recoveries shall be deposited in the fund. Section 6.

from and after its passage and approval."}, {"bill_id": 10176, "bill_version_id": 54870, "bill_version": "Enrolled", "bill_version_date": "2019-03-11T09:36:40.717-05:00", "bill_text": ""}],
