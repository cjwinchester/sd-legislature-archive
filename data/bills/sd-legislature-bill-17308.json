The deposit shall include the utility's reasonable direct costs of all labor, materials and equipment, not including profit or common overhead costs , associated with accommodating the structure move. After the movement of the structure has been completed, the utility shall refund any deposit given in excess of the utility's direct cost incurred in moving its lines or the utility may bill the person moving the structure for the utility's direct cost incurred in excess of the deposit.

No utility may charge any cost for monitoring the movement of a structure under its lines if it is not required to remove or lift any utility lines.
