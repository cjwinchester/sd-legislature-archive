The office may determine which method or combination is most suitable to collect the debt. Section 2. That \u00a7 1-55-4 be amended to read: 1-55-4. For any bad debt referred to the center for collection after July 1, 2015, with the exception of any debt owed within the Board of Regents' system, the center shall collect a cost recovery fee in addition to the debt referred to the center for collection.
