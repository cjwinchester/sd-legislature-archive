Hunt, of Rapid City, South Dakota. WHEREAS, Charles E. Hunt was the loving husband, father, and grandfather, to his wife Glorine, to his children Bonnie, Kathy, Charles Patrick, and Roxanne, and to his grandchildren whom he cherished; and WHEREAS, Charles earned his Masters of Divinity from Dubuque Theological Seminary and then went on to found Three Crosses Ranch in northeast Iowa, a working cattle ranch with fertile farm land which served as a haven where many juvenile delinquent boys found the Lord and learned to lead productive lives. Charles later served as a part time minister at Big Bend Presbyterian Church in Rapid City. He was \"the law\" at Circle B Chuckwagon Suppers for many years and ran the Sunday church service at the ranch for twelve years; and WHEREAS, Charles founded Old West Escrow Co., which still handles hundreds of contracts for deeds in all states and many countries. Charles was a member of Western Writers of America, a distinguished organization, where he published two books of cowboy poetry which focused on keeping the spirit of the west alive. He also wrote a weekly column for the Tri-State Livestock News, \"Scenes from the Saddle\"; and WHEREAS, Charles once wrote a short poem summing up his philosophy: Someone cried, \"Where must the seed be sown to bring the most fruit when it's grown?\" The Master heard as he said and smiled, \"Go plant it for me in the heart of a child.\" Across the fields of yesterday he sometimes comes to me - little lad, just back from play, the boy I used to be. And then he smiles so wistfully, Once he has crept within, I sometimes wonder if he hopes to see The man I might have been.

Hunt be commended on his dedication to his family, his savior Jesus Christ, and the people of South Dakota."}, {"bill_id": 1307, "bill_version_id": 8805, "bill_version": "Enrolled", "bill_version_date": "2009-03-05T17:47:59.68-06:00", "bill_text": "A LEGISLATIVE COMMEMORATION, Honoring the life of Charles E.
