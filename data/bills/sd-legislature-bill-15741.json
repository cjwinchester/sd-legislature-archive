WHEREAS, the State of South Dakota has 1,145,000 acres of national forests and 867,000 acres of national grasslands; and WHEREAS, the national forests and national grasslands are vitally important to the culture, economy, and enjoyment of the people of South Dakota; and WHEREAS, the United States Forest Service is currently developing a revision of the Land and Resource Management Plans for the national grasslands, a plan to \"protect\" all roadless and unroaded areas in the National Forest System, a plan to prohibit off-highway vehicle travel in the Custer National Forest, a new Strategic Plan for the National Forest System, and a revision of the forest planning regulations; and WHEREAS, all of these plans are designed to reduce commodity outputs and motorized recreation in the national forests and grasslands and to promote management for \"pre-European\" conditions; and WHEREAS, the supervisor of the Black Hills National Forest has requested assistance from the chief of the Forest Service in streamlining the analysis and implementation of a project to control the mountain pine beetle epidemic west of Sturgis, and the chief has denied that request; and WHEREAS, a federal district court in Illinois, ruling on a case brought by an environmental special interest group in Indiana, issued an injunction in September of 1999 halting small timber sales offered nationwide since September 16, 1998, that used categorical exclusions, and halting the further use of categorical exclusions for small timber sales designed to salvage small areas of dead and dying trees; and WHEREAS, the chief of the Forest Service's decision on an appeal of the revised forest plan for the Black Hills National Forest will severely curtail the forest management and grazing programs and will delay a decision on the mountain pine beetle Environmental Impact Statement; and WHEREAS, adequate funding is critical to ensure the implementation of forest plans for national forests and national grasslands in South Dakota: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the Senate of the Seventy-fifth Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the House of Representatives concurring therein, that the Legislature of the State of South Dakota strongly supports the concept of multiple use and strongly opposes a policy of managing the national forests and grasslands for \"pre-European\" conditions; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Legislature of the State of South Dakota strongly opposes national initiatives that undermine the role of the people who are directly affected by decisions about the management of the national forests and grasslands; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Legislature of the State of South Dakota opposes further analysis of roadless or unroaded areas in the national forests and grasslands of South Dakota; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Legislature of the State of South Dakota supports all possible and necessary steps to allow the projects to control the mountain pine beetle epidemic in the Black Hills National Forest to proceed immediately; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Legislature of the State of South Dakota opposes the proposed change in travel management from \"open unless closed\" to \"closed unless open\"; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Legislature of the State of South Dakota supports whatever actions are necessary to eliminate the adverse effects of the chief of the Forest Service's October 29, 1999, decision on the appeal of the forest plan revision; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Legislature of the State of South Dakota strongly encourages the Congress of the United States to expeditiously pass legislation amending the \"National Environmental Protection Act\" to allow small timber sales of the scale previously allowed by the Forest Service under categorical exclusion to be exempted from environmental assessment and impact statements to which larger timber sales are subjected; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Legislature of the State of South Dakota supports full funding for the forest plans for the national forests and national grasslands within the State of South Dakota."}, {"bill_id": 15741, "bill_version_id": 87304, "bill_version": "Enrolled", "bill_version_date": "2000-02-22T00:00:00-06:00", "bill_text": "February 3, 2000 February 17, 2000"}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 15741, "action_date": "2000-02-03T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 85855, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/85855.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 630, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 15741, "action_date": "2000-02-03T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 85855, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/85855.pdf", "status_text": "Adopt Resolution", "journal_page": 316, "committee_id_action": 630, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 45887, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [2310, 2311, 2346, 2347, 2358, 2386, 2398, 2400], "Excused": [2329]}}, {"bill_id": 15741, "action_date": "2000-02-03T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 85855, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/85855.pdf", "status_text": "Place on Consent Calendar", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 630, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 15741, "action_date": "2000-02-07T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 85659, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/85659.pdf", "status_text": "Adopt Resolution", "journal_page": 331, "committee_id_action": 657, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 43842, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [2304, 2306, 2307, 2310, 2311, 2320, 2322, 2326, 2329, 2330, 2331, 2335, 2339, 2340, 2344, 2346, 2347, 2352, 2357, 2358, 2364, 2365, 2369, 2376, 2380, 2386, 2389, 2391, 2395, 2398, 2399, 2400, 2405], "Nay": [2375], "Excused": [2381]}}, {"bill_id": 15741, "action_date": "2000-02-08T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 85660, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/85660.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 487, "committee_id_action": 656, "committee_id_assigned": 642, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 15741, "action_date": "2000-02-17T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 85947, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/85947.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 642, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 15741, "action_date": "2000-02-17T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 85947, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/85947.pdf", "status_text": "Concur In resolution", "journal_page": 718, "committee_id_action": 642, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 44626, "president_vote": null, "Excused": [2318], "Yea": [2327, 2341, 2354, 2366, 2390, 2392, 2403, 2316, 2355, 2367, 2404, 2309]}}, {"bill_id": 15741, "action_date": "2000-02-18T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 85676, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/85676.pdf", "status_text": "Concur In resolution", "journal_page": 750, "committee_id_action": 656, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 46317, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [2305, 2308, 2309, 2312, 2313, 2314, 2315, 2316, 2317, 2319, 2321, 2323, 2324, 2325, 2327, 2328, 2332, 2333, 2334, 2336, 2337, 2338, 2341, 2342, 2343, 2345, 2348, 2349, 2350, 2353, 2354, 2355, 2356, 2360, 2361, 2362, 2363, 2366, 2367, 2370, 2371, 2372, 2374, 2377, 2378, 2379, 2382, 2383, 2384, 2385, 2388, 2390, 2392, 2393, 2401, 2403, 2406, 2407, 2351], "Excused": [2318, 2373, 2387, 2394, 2396, 2397, 2404, 2408], "Absent": [2359, 2402], "Nay": [2368]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/15741"}
