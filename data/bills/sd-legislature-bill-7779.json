The restricted COLA is equal to the increase in the consumer price index, but no less than one-half percent and no greater than the restricted COLA maximum as determined in subdivision (2) of this section.

The COLA payable is the restricted COLA. If the criteria in subdivisions 3-12-122(1) and (2) cannot be satisfied with a COLA equal to or exceeding one-half percent, the COLA payable is one-half percent. Section 2.

The report shall include an analysis of the conditions and recommendations for the circumstances and timing for any benefit changes, contribution changes, or any other corrective action, or any combination of actions, to improve the conditions in subdivisions (1) and (2).

That ARSD 62:01:04:09 be amended to read: 62:01:04:09...Criteria for determining disability if contributory service ended prior to before July 1, 1995 _ Position of comparable level. An applicant whose contributory service ends prior to July 1, 1995, shall be granted a disability allowance benefit only if the applicant establishes the following by a preponderance of evidence: (1) The applicant has a mental or physical impairment which has been diagnosed by a licensed physician; (2) At the time of termination of the applicant's employment, the impairment was of sufficient severity to prevent the applicant from continuing to perform usual duties for the applicant's employer; (3) At the time of termination of the applicant's employment, the impairment was of sufficient severity to prevent the applicant from performing the duties of a position of comparable level for which the applicant is qualified by education, training, and experience; and (4) At the time of termination of the applicant's employment, the disability was expected to last at least one year. Evidence that the applicant could actually secure a position of comparable level or that such a position is actually available is not required to support a finding that an applicant is capable of performing the duties of such a position. Section 43. That ARSD 62:01:04:09.01 be amended to read: 62:01:04:09.01...Criteria for determining disability if contributory service ended after July 1, 1995 _ Certification by employer.

In providing certification pursuant to subdivision (3), above, an employer shall consider the applicant's education, experience, training, work history, impairment, location of residence, and compensation and benefits in relation to positions of possible comparable level. Section 44. That ARSD 62:01:04:10 be amended to read: 62:01:04:10...Member receiving a disability allowance benefit if service ended prior to before July 1, 1994. For purposes of this chapter, a member is considered to be receiving a disability allowance benefit if the applicant's application for the allowance benefit has been approved, whether SDCL 3-12-101 prevents the member from receiving any payment from the system. The provisions of this section apply only if the member's contributory service ended prior to before July 1, 1994. Section 45. That ARSD 62:01:08:03 be amended to read: 62:01:08:03...Applicability of limits. If a member has been credited with less than 10 years of credited service, the maximum annual retirement allowance benefit shall be reduced by multiplying the maximum annual pension by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of the member's years of credited service and the denominator of which is 10. The limits in \u00a7.62:01:08:01 apply to a straight life annuity with no ancillary benefits and to an annuity that constitutes a qualified joint and survivor annuity, provided payment begins between ages 62 and 65. The limits, however, do not apply to any portion of a benefit resulting from required member contributions made on an after-tax basis. If payment begins before age 62, the limits shall be reduced so that they are actuarially equivalent to such a benefit beginning at age 62. For police or fire fighters who are members of the system, the limit may not be reduced for retirement before age 62, regardless of retirement age, provided that the member has completed at least 15 years of credited service. If payment begins after age 65, the limit is the actuarial equivalent of a $160,000 annual benefit, as indexed pursuant to \u00a7.415(d)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code, commencing at age 65. The interest assumption for purposes of determining actuarial equivalency under this section is the interest rate otherwise used for purposes of computing optional forms of income payable under the system, but the rate may not be less than 5 percent annually if benefits begin before age 62 and may not exceed 5 percent annually if benefits begin after age 65. Section 46. That ARSD 62:01:09:02 be amended to read: 62:01:09:02...System may pay a single monthly payment. The system may pay the participant's monthly supplemental pension benefit and the participant's monthly retirement allowance benefit in a single payment. However, for all other purposes, each shall be regarded as a separate benefit, including provision of a separate Internal Revenue Service Form 1009-R for each by the system. Section 47. That ARSD 62:01:09:06 be amended to read: 62:01:09:06...Participant's status as a retiree. For purposes of this chapter, a member of the system who has received payment of at least one monthly retirement allowance benefit is a retiree, even if the member has returned to employment with a member unit, either with or without suspension of the retirement allowance benefit. Section 48. The Code Commission and the Code Counsel shall substitute the term, benefit, for the term, allowance, in the chapter titles of ARSD 62:01:03 and 62:01:04."}, {"bill_id": 7779, "bill_version_id":
