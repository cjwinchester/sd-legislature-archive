BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 41-6-12 be amended to read: 41-6-12. Any person who is a resident of this state, as defined by this title, qualifies as resident for securing any resident hunting or fishing license or preference points. All other persons shall secure the applicable nonresident hunting and fishing licenses or preference points. No person under the age of twelve years may be granted any hunting license or preference point. However, any person who is eleven years of age and who will become twelve years of age during the period September first through December thirty-first, inclusive, may be granted any hunting license or preference point and be allowed to hunt beginning September first. Section 2. That \u00a7 41-6-13 be amended to read: 41-6-13. A resident hunting license may be issued only to a resident sixteen years of age or older. However, the parent or guardian of a resident who is less than sixteen years of age and meets the age requirements of \u00a7 41-6-12 may apply for the license for such person. If a license is granted on the application, the license authorizes hunting by the person only if accompanied by a parent, guardian, or responsible adult and is valid for the license year as provided by the applicable license and rules promulgated by the Game, Fish and Parks Commission pursuant to chapter 1-26. The requirement to be accompanied by an adult no longer applies when the licensee attains sixteen years of age. A violation of this section is a Class 2 misdemeanor. Section 3. That \u00a7 41-6-14 be amended to read: 41-6-14. Any person between the ages of eleven years and under the age of sixteen years shall first comply with the provisions of chapter 41-7, pertaining to firearms safety, before being granted a resident hunting license or the applicable nonresident hunting licenses."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 7373, "action_date": "2016-02-03T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 38701, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/38701.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 258, "committee_id_action": 325, "committee_id_assigned": 321, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 7373, "action_date": "2016-02-11T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 39045, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/39045.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 321, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 7373, "action_date": "2016-02-11T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 39229, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/39229.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to the 41st legislative day", "journal_page": 378, "committee_id_action": 321, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 20864, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [964, 1039, 980, 1056, 1018, 1054, 1007, 1030, 988, 1032, 1055, 1031], "Nay": [1058]}}]}
