WHEREAS, certain unique or special events, such as the annual Sturgis motorcycle rally, can have unusual impacts on local economies; and WHEREAS, some special events in the state cause changes in property values and tax valuations that do not reflect actual use or value during the remainder of the year; and WHEREAS, such taxation impacts may create an unfair circumstance for other property owners in the area who are not directly connected with the special event: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the House of Representatives of the Seventy- second Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the Senate concurring therein, that the Executive Board of the Legislative Research Council be requested to appoint an interim study committee to conduct a thorough review of the effects of special events, such as the Sturgis motorcycle rally and other special circumstances, on valuation for taxation purposes in municipalities. The committee shall report its findings to the 1998 Legislature. 750 copies of this document were printed by the South Dakota Legislative Research Council at a cost of $.015 per page. .
