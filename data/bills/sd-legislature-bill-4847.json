If any livestock, inspected under the provisions of this chapter or chapter 40-20 bears an unrecorded brand, or a recorded brand other than the brand of the seller person selling the livestock or transporting the livestock out of the ownership inspection area , and does not bear the recorded brand of such seller person , then the seller person selling or transporting the livestock shall be required to establish his ownership to such the livestock, by presenting to the livestock ownership inspector a witnessed bill of sale to such the animal or by other satisfactory evidence of ownership which may include an affidavit of ownership signed by the seller person selling or transporting the livestock and witnessed by the ownership inspector. If any livestock listed on the original bill of sale or affidavit of ownership are not sold or transported out of the ownership inspection area , the inspector shall pick up the ownership documents and issue a receipt showing the number of livestock sold or transported and the number remaining. If any livestock are unbranded, the inspector may require the shipper or seller to establish his ownership by presenting to the inspector an affidavit of ownership. Only an original bill of sale or affidavit of ownership is valid for proof of ownership. Any bill of sale or affidavit shall be notarized or signed by two witnesses. Section 2.

If any livestock inspected under the provisions of this chapter or chapter 40-20 bears the recorded brand of the seller or the person transporting the livestock out of the ownership inspection area , and also bears a recorded brand other than the brand of the seller of another person , then the seller or the person transporting the livestock out of the ownership inspection area may be required, at the discretion of the livestock ownership inspector, to establish ownership to such the livestock by presenting to the ownership inspector satisfactory evidence of ownership.
