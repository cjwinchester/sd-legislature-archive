That chapter 5-18A be amended by adding a NEW SECTION to read: No person who serves on a state board may have an interest in a contract or derive a benefit from a contract with the state in any subject area that is governed by the board, nor for a one-year period following the end of the board member's service as a state board member may the board member derive a direct benefit as a result of the contract.

This prohibition does not include any state board member who serves without compensation or who may be paid per diem pursuant to \u00a7 4-7-10.4. Section 2. That \u00a7 5-18A-17.2 be repealed. 5-18A-17.2. A governing body may authorize an officer or employee whose responsibilities include approving, awarding, or administering a contract on behalf of a state agency or supervising any employee who has these responsibilities to be a party to or derive a direct benefit from a contract if: (1) The officer or employee has provided full written disclosure to the governing body; (2) The governing body has reviewed the essential terms of the transaction or contract and the state officer's or employee's role in the contract or transaction; and (3) The transaction and the terms of the contract are fair, reasonable, and not contrary to the public interest.
