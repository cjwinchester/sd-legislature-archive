WHEREAS, there are one hundred eighty-two state-owned dams throughout the State of South Dakota, built in the 1930s and 1940s by the Works Progress Administration (WPA) or Civilian Conservation Corps. Eighty-four of these dams are currently managed by the Department of Game, Fish and Parks and ninety-eight of these dams are currently managed by the commissioner of School and Public Lands; and WHEREAS, there is a system that provides for the inspection of the state-owned dams and ranks their risk. However, there is no dedicated state funding source for the management, improvement, repair, or maintenance of the state-owned dams; and WHEREAS, the current system of state ownership of dams is dysfunctional and confusing. There is a lack of information on the status of the state-owned dams for the stake holders in the area of the dams. There is no mechanism or funding alternative for the stake holders to pursue to improve, repair, and maintain the dams; and WHEREAS, landowners, lake residents, downstream landowners, townships, municipalities, counties, and many others have a major stake in the safety and condition of the dams in their areas; and WHEREAS, there is a need to significantly improve the current defective system of state-owned dams: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the Senate of the Eighty-Third Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the House of Representatives concurring therein, that the South Dakota Legislature urges the Governor, the Commissioner of School and Public Lands, the Department of Game, Fish and Parks, and the Department of Environment and Natural Resources to work together to develop a system of managing the state-owned dams, evaluate their risks, and communicate the risks to those in the area of each dam; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Governor, the Commissioner of School and Public Lands, the Department of Game, Fish and Parks, and the Department of Environment and Natural Resources determine the amount of annual funding needed to address the management, improvement, repair, and maintenance of the state-owned dams and the source of funding for such purposes; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Governor, the Commissioner of School and Public Lands, the Department of Game, Fish and Parks, and the Department of Environment and Natural Resources report their recommendations to the 2009 Legislature for action and implementation to establish a system for the state-owned dams."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 450, "action_date": "2008-02-25T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 3929, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/3929.pdf", "status_text": "First Reading", "journal_page": 622, "committee_id_action": 28, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 450, "action_date": "2008-02-26T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 4020, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/4020.pdf", "status_text": "Adopt Resolution", "journal_page": 639, "committee_id_action": 28, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 2533, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [557, 576, 621, 604, 553, 596, 560, 590, 598, 545, 592, 530, 601, 567, 535, 533, 582, 562, 622, 584, 569, 573, 618, 610, 629, 613, 632, 577, 588, 539, 627, 548, 550, 541, 607]}}, {"bill_id": 450, "action_date": "2008-02-27T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 4116, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/4116.pdf", "status_text": "First read and referred to", "journal_page": 773, "committee_id_action": 27, "committee_id_assigned": 13, "result": "N", "vote": {}}]}
