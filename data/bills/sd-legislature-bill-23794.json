The commission shall, by majority vote of all members, take final action on the proposed rule and shall determine the effective date of the rule, if any, based on the rulemaking record and the full text of the rule. M. Upon determination that an emergency exists, the commission may consider and adopt an emergency rule without prior notice, opportunity for comment, or hearing, provided that the usual rulemaking procedures set forth in the compact and in this section must be retroactively applied to the rule as soon as reasonably possible, but no later than ninety days after the effective date of the rule. For the purposes of this provision, an emergency rule is one that must be adopted immediately in order to: 1. Meet an imminent threat to public health, safety, or welfare; 2. Prevent a loss of commission or member state funds; 3. Meet a deadline for the promulgation of an administrative rule that is established by federal law or regulation; or 4. Protect public health and safety. N. The commission or an authorized committee of the commission may direct revisions to a previously adopted rule or amendment for purposes of correcting typographical errors, errors in formatting, errors in consistency, or grammatical errors. Public notice of any revisions must be posted on the website of the commission. The revision is subject to challenge by any person for a period of thirty days after posting. The revision may be challenged only on grounds that the revision results in a material change to a rule. A challenge must be made in writing and delivered to the chair of the commission, prior to the end of the notice period. If no challenge is made, the revision takes effect without further action. If the revision is challenged, the revision may not take effect without the approval of the commission. Section 12. That a NEW SECTION be added: A. The following terms and conditions are also applicable: 1. The executive, legislative, and judicial branches of state government in each member state shall enforce this compact and take all actions necessary and appropriate to effectuate the compact\u2019s purposes and intent, provided, this compact and the rules promulgated hereunder have standing as statutory law; 2. All courts shall take judicial notice of the compact and the rules in any judicial or administrative proceeding in a member state pertaining to the subject matter of the compact, which may affect the powers, responsibilities, or actions of the commission; and 3. The commission is entitled to receive service of process in any such proceeding, and has standing to intervene in such a proceeding for all purposes, provided a failure to provide service of process to the commission renders a judgment or order void as to the commission, this compact, or promulgated rules. B. The following terms and conditions are also applicable: 1. If the commission determines that a member state has defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact or the promulgated rules, the commission shall: a. Provide written notice to the defaulting state and other member states regarding the nature of the default, the proposed means of curing the default, and any other action to be taken by the commission; and b. Provide remedial training and specific technical assistance regarding the default; 2. If a state in default fails to cure the default, the defaulting state may be terminated from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the member states, and all rights, privileges and benefits conferred by this compact may be terminated on the effective date of termination, provided a cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of default; 3. Termination of membership in the compact may be imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted; 4. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate must be given by the commission to the governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state\u2019s legislature, and each of the member states; 5. A state that has been terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination, including obligations that extend beyond the effective date of termination; 6. The commission may not bear any costs related to a state that is found to be in default or that has been terminated from the compact, unless agreed upon in writing between the commission and the defaulting state; and 7. The defaulting state may appeal the action of the commission by petitioning the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the commission has its principal offices, provided the prevailing member must be awarded all costs of litigation, including reasonable attorney\u2019s fees. C. The following terms and conditions are also applicable: 1. Upon request by a member state, the commission shall attempt to resolve disputes related to the compact, which arise among member states and between member and non-member states; and 2. The commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes as appropriate. D. The following terms and conditions are also applicable: 1. The commission, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, shall enforce the provisions and rules of this compact; 2. By majority vote, the commission may initiate legal action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the commission has its principal offices against a member state in default to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact and its promulgated rules and bylaws, provided the relief sought may include both injunctive relief and damages; 3. If judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing member must be awarded all costs of litigation, including reasonable attorney\u2019s fees; and 4. The remedies set forth in this section are not the exclusive remedies of the commission and the commission may pursue other remedies available under federal or state law. Section 13. That a NEW SECTION be added: A. The compact shall take effect on the date that the compact is enacted in the tenth member state. The provisions, which become effective at that time, are limited to the powers granted to the commission relating to assembly and the promulgation of rules. Thereafter, the commission shall meet and exercise rulemaking powers necessary to the implementation and administration of the compact. B. Any state that joins the compact after the initial adoption of the rules is subject to the rules as they exist on the date that the compact becomes law in that state. Any rule that was previously adopted by the commission has the full force and effect of law on the day the compact becomes law in that state. C. A member state may withdraw from this compact by repealing the enacting statute. 1. A member state\u2019s withdrawal is not effective until six months after enactment of the repealing statute. 2. Withdrawal does not affect the continuing requirement of the withdrawing state\u2019s occupational therapy licensing board to comply with the investigative and adverse action reporting requirements of this compact prior to the effective date of withdrawal. D. Nothing contained in this compact invalidates or prevents any occupational therapy licensure agreement or other cooperative arrangement between a member state and a non-member state, provided it does not conflict with this compact. E. This compact may be amended by the member states. No amendment to this compact may become effective and binding upon any member state until it is enacted into law by all the member states. Section 14. That a NEW SECTION be added: This compact must be liberally construed so as to effectuate its purposes. The provisions of this compact are severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence, or provision of this compact is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any member state or of the United States, or the applicability to any government, agency, person, or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability of this compact to any government, agency, person, or circumstance is not affected. If this compact is held to be contrary to the constitution of any member state, the compact must remain in full force and effect as to the remaining member states and in full force and effect as to the member state affected as to all severable matters. Section 15. That a NEW SECTION be added: A. A licensee providing occupational therapy in a remote state under the compact privilege shall function within the laws and rules of the remote state. B. Nothing in this compact prevents the enforcement of any other law of a member state, which is not inconsistent with the compact. C. Any laws in a member state that are in conflict with this compact are superseded to the extent of the conflict. D.
