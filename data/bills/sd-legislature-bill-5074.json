Any municipality issuing a license pursuant to this section is not subject to the quotas established in \u00a7 35-4-11. Any county issuing a license pursuant to this section is not subject to the quotas established in \u00a7 35-4-11.1.

After the fee for an on-sale license issued pursuant to this Act has been determined, no municipality or county may change the fee for a period of ten years unless an increase in population reported by the federal decennial census requires an increase in the fee.

If the transaction for the purchase of the on-sale license included real or personal property, the full market value of the real or personal property on the date of the original sale shall be deducted from the total transaction price to determine the amount paid by the licensee for the on-sale license. The burden of establishing the amount paid for the license shall be on the licensee. Any licensee contesting the fair market value of the real and personal property may appeal the valuation to circuit court.

However, such license fee may not be less than the minimum license fees established pursuant to subdivision 35-4-2(4) or (6).

Each on- sale license holder as of January 1, 2008, who acquired the on-sale license within the last ten years shall report to the municipality or county the date and price paid for its on-sale license. Section 5. The municipality or county shall maintain a registry of each on-sale license that is being offered for sale at the price established in section 4 of this Act and furnish a copy of the registry to anyone who requests a new on-sale license.

The price of any on-sale license registered as, for sale, with the municipality or county shall be sold at the current fair market price set by the municipality or county pursuant to section 4 of this Act.
