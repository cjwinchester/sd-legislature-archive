Section 24. That \u00a7 49-31-1.4 be repealed. 49-31-1.4. For the purposes of this chapter, \"price regulation\" is the procedure used by the commission to approve the charge for an emerging or noncompetitive telecommunications service which is not based on rate of return regulation. In determining whether the price is fair and reasonable, the commission shall determine and consider the price of alternative services, the overall market for the service, the affordability of the price for the service in the market it is offered, and the impact of the price of the service on the commitment to preserve affordable universal service. In determining the price for an emerging competitive service, the commission shall also consider the actual cost of providing the service. In determining the price for a noncompetitive service, the commission shall also consider the fully allocated cost of providing the service. Section 25. That \u00a7 49-31-2 be repealed. 49-31-2. The provisions of chapters 49-7 to 49-13, inclusive, and this chapter apply to all telecommunications companies and to all telecommunications lines and facilities of any kind, character or description in use by any corporation, receiver, trustee or other person operating a telecommunications company, whether owned or operated under contract, agreement, lease or otherwise. Section 26. That \u00a7 49-31-3.1 be repealed. 49-31-3.1. A telecommunications company may not discontinue any noncompetitive telecommunications service without the express approval of the commission. A telecommunications company need only notify the commission of the discontinuance of any emerging competitive telecommunications service. Section 27. That \u00a7 49-31-3.2 be repealed. 49-31-3.2. The commission, after notice and hearing, shall waive, eliminate or modify any of its rules or orders affecting telecommunications services if it finds that a telecommunications service is a fully competitive service or an emerging competitive service. A person, or the commission on its own motion, may apply to have an emerging competitive service of a telecommunications company classified as a fully competitive service or a noncompetitive service classified as an emerging competitive service or a fully competitive service. The application shall be filed with the commission and served on any other person designated by the commission. The application shall be in a form prescribed by the commission. The commission, in determining how a telecommunications service is to be classified, shall consider: (1) The number and size of alternative providers of the service and the affiliation to other providers; (2) The extent to which services are available from alternative providers in the relevant market; (3) The ability of alternative providers to make functionally equivalent or substitute services readily available at competitive rates, terms, and conditions of service; (4) The market share, the ability of the market to hold prices close to cost, and other economic measures of market power; and (5) The impact on universal service. The commission shall approve or deny any such application within ninety days after the filing of the application. However, the commission may, by order, defer the period within which it must act for one additional period of ninety days, upon a finding that the proceeding cannot be completed within ninety days and that the additional time period is necessary for the commission to adequately and completely fulfill its duty under this title. If the commission has not acted on any such application within the appropriate time period permitted, the application shall be deemed granted. Section 28. That \u00a7 49-31-3.3 be repealed. 49-31-3.3. The commission may, within ninety days after July 1, 1988, conclude an investigation into any or all of the telecommunications services listed in \u00a7 \u00a7 49-31-1.1, 49-31-1.2 and 49-31-1.3 to determine if any service is properly classified pursuant to the standards found in subdivisions 49-31-3.2(1) to (5), inclusive. The commission may, after notice and hearing, reclassify any service to conform the classification of the service to the evidence and the standards in \u00a7 49-31-3.2. The telecommunications company providing the service has the burden of proving the classification is appropriate. During this ninety-day period, any service subject to the investigation will remain under rate of return regulation. Upon expiration of the ninety-day period, reclassification of any service, even if hearings had commenced within the ninety days, will be pursuant to the provisions of \u00a7 49-31-3.4. Section 29. That \u00a7 49-31-3.4 be repealed. 49-31-3.4. The commission, on its own motion or upon petition, shall commence regulation or reclassify a telecommunications service previously classified by the Legislature or the commission as a fully competitive service or an emerging competitive service if, after hearing or investigation, the commission finds: (1) That the market for that emerging competitive service does not satisfy the criteria of \u00a7 49-31-3.2 and does not have alternative telecommunications services available to over twenty percent of the telecommunications company's customers for that service; or (2) That the market for that fully competitive service does not satisfy the criteria of \u00a7 49-31-3.2 and does not have alternative telecommunications services available to over fifty percent of the telecommunications company's customers for that service. In any proceeding to reclassify a telecommunications service, the person initiating the petition has the burden of proving that the existing classification is inappropriate, except the telecommunications company providing the service has the burden of proving that the classification is appropriate if the proceeding is commenced by the commission on its own motion. Upon the filing of a petition under this section and upon application, the commission may enter an order staying a price change, for not more than thirty days, for the disputed service pending a hearing on the merits of the petition, for reasonable cause shown. If a petition under this section is found to be spurious or vexatious, the commission may assess reasonable penalties and costs against the petitioning party, which may include reasonable attorney fees. However, the penalties and costs may not be assessed against the commission. Section 30. That \u00a7 49-31-4 be repealed. 49-31-4. Any charge established for the provision of telecommunications services shall be fair and reasonable. The commission shall determine and approve individual rates to be charged by any telecommunications company for a noncompetitive service pursuant to \u00a7 49-31-1.4, if applicable, and pursuant to \u00a7 \u00a7 49-31-12, 49-31-12.2 and 49-31-12.4. Except as provided in \u00a7 49-31-4.1, the commission shall utilize rate of return regulation when determining the charge for a noncompetitive service. The commission shall determine and approve individual prices to be charged by a telecommunications company for any emerging competitive service pursuant to \u00a7 \u00a7 49-31-1.4, 49-31-12, 49-31-12.2 and 49-31-12.5. However, there is no rate of return regulation of emerging competitive services and no rate of return or price regulation of fully competitive services. The commission shall separate, assign and distribute a telecommunications company's revenues, investments, and expenses among all services offered. The commission shall, by rules promulgated pursuant to chapter 1-26, prescribe the methodologies by which a telecommunications company shall segregate its revenues, investments and expenses. The methodologies prescribed by the rules shall be in accord with federal and state law. No telecommunications company may use the revenues from emerging competitive services to subsidize fully competitive services or revenues from noncompetitive services to subsidize emerging competitive services or fully competitive services. Expenses and investment of fully competitive services may not be attributed to emerging competitive services or noncompetitive services and the expenses and investment of emerging competitive services may not be attributed to noncompetitive services. Rates being charged by a telecommunications company on July 1, 1988, shall be deemed to be the fair, reasonable, and effective rates until changed or altered pursuant to this chapter. Section 31. That \u00a7 49-31-4.1 be repealed. 49-31-4.1. The commission shall, on its own motion or upon petition, hold public hearings investigating methods of price regulation consistent with \u00a7 49-31-1.4 and chapter 1-26. Within thirty days of its receipt of a petition filed pursuant to this section, the commission shall issue a procedural schedule setting forth dates by which written direct testimony or data shall be filed and ordering the date for commencement of a hearing. If the investigation indicates that pricing regulation is appropriate for any noncompetitive service because such regulation has a positive impact on universal service and is more reasonable and fair than rate of return regulation, the commission may adopt pricing regulation for any such noncompetitive service. Section 32. That \u00a7 49-31-4.2 be repealed. 49-31-4.2. A telecommunications company providing intrastate interexchange telecommunications services shall charge uniform prices on all routes where it offers the services. However, notwithstanding this section and \u00a7 49-31-11, a telecommunications company may offer or provide volume discounts and may pass through any state, municipal or local taxes in the specific geographic areas from which the taxes originate. Section 33. That \u00a7 49-31-4.3 be repealed. 49-31-4.3. Each telecommunications company engaged directly or indirectly in any business other than that of providing telecommunications service shall keep and, if requested by the commission, render separately to the commission, in like manner and form the relevant accounts of all such other businesses. The provisions of this chapter apply to the books, accounts, papers and records of relevant transactions with such other businesses. All profits and losses of such other business may be considered by the commission as are relevant to the general fiscal condition of the telecommunications company. The commission, in determining the allowance for materials or services to be included in costs of operations for rate of return or price regulation for noncompetitive services, may disallow any unreasonable profit made in the sale of materials to or service supplied for any telecommunications company by any firm or corporation owned or controlled directly or indirectly by such company or any affiliate, subsidiary, parent company, associate or any corporation whose controlling stockholders are also controlling stockholders of such telecommunications company. The burden of proof shall be on the telecommunications company to prove that no unreasonable profit is involved. Section 34. That \u00a7 49-31-5.2 be repealed. 49-31-5.2. An independent telecommunications company may be brought under commission regulation if no fewer than five percent of the subscribers, or twenty-five subscribers, whichever is the greater, petition the commission to hold an election of all subscribers of the company to return the company to commission regulation. Section 35. That \u00a7 49-31-5.3 be repealed. 49-31-5.3. The ballot to be used in the election shall be approved by the independent telecommunications company and the commission. The commission shall mail ballots, at company cost, to the company's subscribers who shall return the ballots to the commission. The commission shall keep the ballots sealed until the date agreed upon by the commission and board of directors. On the date set, a commission representative and a representative of the company shall count the ballots. If a majority of the company's subscribers elect to become subject to regulation by the commission, the election shall be effective thirty days after the date the ballots are counted. Section 36. That \u00a7 49-31-5.4 be repealed. 49-31-5.4. The term \"subscribers\" as used in \u00a7 \u00a7 49-31-5.2 and 49-31-5.3 means either the person in whose name the telecommunications service is registered or the spouse of the person unless the independent telecommunications company has been notified in writing to the contrary. Section 37. That \u00a7 49-31-6 be repealed. 49-31-6.

The commission may order such changes or improvements in telecommunications facilities, exchanges or networks as necessary for the improvement of telecommunications service and the convenience of the public. If, in the judgment of the commission, any repair upon telecommunications facilities, a change in its rates, a change in the mode of operating telecommunications facilities or conducting telecommunications company business is necessary, reasonable and expedient in order to promote the safety, convenience and accommodation of the public, the commission shall notify the telecommunications company immediately, and such telecommunications company shall change the mode of operating its facilities or conducting its business, or repair, renew or replace such facilities in such manner, of such material and within such time as the commission may order.

Section 52. That \u00a7 49-31-17 be repealed. 49-31-17. Notwithstanding \u00a7 49-31-15, no access may be compelled except at or within the local exchange boundary, or a centralized point serving several exchanges, of the telecommunications company refusing the access. The company refusing access may not be compelled by the commission to build a facility outside its local exchange territory, or a centralized point serving several exchanges, to connect to the telecommunications company requesting the access.

If the commission finds after an investigation, notice and, with or without, public hearing that the public interest will be benefited by the consolidation or merger, the commission may issue a permit granting the consolidation or merger. Section 56. That \u00a7 49-31-21 be repealed. 49-31-21. Any person before commencing the construction of a telecommunications facility, or an extension of an existing telecommunications facility outside its lawful local exchange territory, shall first apply to the commission for authority to do so.

Nothing in this section prohibits the construction of nonaccess facilities which cross the local exchange territory being lawfully occupied and served by another telecommunications company furnishing reasonably adequate service. Nothing in this section affects construction or extension of facilities within the local exchange territory for which a company has the certificate to operate, into contiguous territory which is not receiving similar service, or where a certificated telecommunications company agrees in writing to an attachment of lines or to the construction of telecommunications facilities in the affected company's local exchange territory.

The commission shall use the deposit to defray the expense incident to conducting the hearing or investigation of the company making the deposit. The deposit is appropriated to the use of the commission for such purpose. The funds necessary for such expenses are hereby authorized to be expended. Section 58. That \u00a7 49-31-45 be repealed. 49-31-45.

Upon the conclusion of the investigation or hearing, the commission shall make an accounting of the deposit and shall give the company making the deposit, within thirty days of the final decision, notice in writing of the itemization and the amount that is proposed to be returned to the company. Any company protesting the itemization may file objections with the commission within thirty days of receiving the itemization.
