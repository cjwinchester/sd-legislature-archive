This process shall continue until the number of names provided for pursuant to \u00a7 16-13-2 is selected. The processes specified in this section may be performed electronically. Section 4.

A person has served as a juror if that person has been summoned and appeared for a trial. If, from examination of the master juror lists at any time, it appears that any person listed thereon does not have the qualifications to serve as a juror or has served as a juror within two preceding years, the board of jury selectors clerk of courts shall strike such the name from the list and draw another in its place if necessary.
