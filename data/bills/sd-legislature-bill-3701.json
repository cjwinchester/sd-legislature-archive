BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 11-9-13 be amended to read as follows: 11-9-13. The planning commission shall adopt a project plan for each tax incremental district and submit the plan to the governing body. The plan shall include a statement listing: (1) The kind, number, and location of all proposed public works or improvements within the district; (2) An economic feasibility study; (3) A detailed list of estimated project costs; (4) A fiscal impact statement which shows the impact of the tax increment district, both until and after the bonds are repaid, upon all entities levying taxes upon property in the district; and (5) A description of the methods of financing all estimated project costs and the time when related costs or monetary obligations are to be incurred. No expenditure for any project costs may be provided for in the plan more than five years after a district is created unless an amendment is adopted by the governing body under \u00a7 11-9-23. For the purposes of this section, the term, expenditure, means that a monetary payment has been made and does not include any obligation by contract or agreement. Section 2. That \u00a7 11-9-42 be amended to read as follows: 11-9-42. No tax increments shall may be used for the construction of residential structures, except residential structures which are integral to the project. The costs for the residential structures may not exceed twenty percent of the total project costs. No tax increments may be used for construction of any residential structures unless the project is located in the downtown district of a municipality with a population of more than ten thousand. Section 3. That chapter 11-9 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: No governing body may adopt a resolution pursuant to \u00a7 11-9-5 unless a statement is provided that clearly details the financial and economic documentation that the project could not proceed without the creation of the tax increment district pursuant to this chapter. Specific spreadsheets and data shall be given to the governing body indicating such items as absence of reasonable return on investment, barriers to credit by reason of costs versus returns, and specific uneconomic conditions of the proposed project."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 3701, "action_date": "2012-01-26T13:30:00-06:00", "document_id": 20314, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/20314.pdf", "status_text": "First read in Senate and referred to", "journal_page": 192, "committee_id_action": 171, "committee_id_assigned": 156, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 3701, "action_date": "2012-02-08T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 20842, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/20842.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 156, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 3701, "action_date": "2012-02-08T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 20984, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/20984.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to the 41st legislative day", "journal_page": 314, "committee_id_action": 156, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 11229, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [253, 219, 243], "Yea": [249, 255, 286, 236, 254], "Excused": [235]}}, {"bill_id": 3701, "action_date": "2012-02-10T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 21230, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/21230.pdf", "status_text": "Removed from table", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 156, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 11447, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [253, 249, 235, 254, 219, 243], "Excused": [255, 236], "Nay": [286]}}, {"bill_id": 3701, "action_date": "2012-02-13T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 21244, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/21244.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 156, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 3701, "action_date": "2012-02-13T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 21344, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/21344.pdf", "status_text": "Tabled", "journal_page": 384, "committee_id_action": 156, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 11553, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [253, 249, 235, 286, 236, 254, 219, 243], "Excused": [255]}}]}
