WHEREAS, South Dakota possesses a wealth of fish and wildlife and other outdoor resources that have played a long and important role in our state's social and economic history and continue to enhance the quality of life of our citizens; and WHEREAS, hunting, including big game hunting, is a traditional part of our way of life and has provided recreation, sustenance, and good memories for generations of South Dakota residents and visitors to our state. Hunting has been a mainstay of South Dakota's economy for many years, and resident and nonresident hunters continue to generate significant income for South Dakota landowners and businesses; and WHEREAS, parts of South Dakota's agricultural economy continue to face economic hardship and are searching for ways to diversify their activities and to make the most of their economic resources; and WHEREAS, the provision of prime hunting opportunities for resident and nonresident sportsmen is one activity that can provide a valuable opportunity for many South Dakota landowners; and WHEREAS, many western states currently allow landowners to purchase big-game hunting licenses on a limited basis and resell them to hunters for use on the landowner's property. This practice allows landowners to offer premium hunting to guests without reducing big game licenses or hunting opportunities for other resident hunters; and WHEREAS, South Dakota law currently prohibits the transfer of hunting licenses and restricts the availability of big game licenses, leaving landowners uncertain of whether licenses will be available for potential customers who would hunt on their land; and WHEREAS, a transferrable big game hunting license program would enable landowners to plan with certainty and allow them to schedule hunts on their property to make full use of their economic resources; and WHEREAS, revenues from transferrable big game hunting licenses for landowners could be used to improve hunting access and hunting opportunities for South Dakota hunters: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the House of Representatives of the Seventy- eighth Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the Senate concurring therein, that the South Dakota Legislature urges the Game, Fish and Parks Commission to give careful consideration and study to the establishment of a transferrable big game hunting license program that would allow landowners to market licenses to their clients in a manner that would not lessen hunting opportunities for South Dakota residents and would use program revenues to provide for additional hunting access for South Dakotans; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Game, Fish and Parks Commission is requested to report to the 2004 Legislature on the feasibility and characteristics of potential transferrable big game hunting license programs."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 17660, "action_date": "2003-02-25T09:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 97880, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/97880.pdf", "status_text": "Adopt Resolution", "journal_page": 610, "committee_id_action": 784, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 55048, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [2837, 2846, 2848, 2855, 2860, 2910, 2913, 2917, 2893], "Nay": [2862, 2870, 2923, 2933]}}, {"bill_id": 17660, "action_date": "2003-02-25T09:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 97880, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/97880.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 784, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 17660, "action_date": "2003-02-26T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 98014, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/98014.pdf", "status_text": "Adopt Resolution", "journal_page": 634, "committee_id_action": 798, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 56779, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [2833, 2836, 2837, 2839, 2842, 2843, 2846, 2848, 2855, 2860, 2861, 2862, 2866, 2869, 2872, 2875, 2877, 2879, 2890, 2893, 2894, 2895, 2896, 2898, 2902, 2906, 2910, 2913, 2914, 2915, 2917, 2919, 2920, 2925, 2933, 2938], "Nay": [2841, 2844, 2845, 2858, 2859, 2863, 2864, 2870, 2871, 2873, 2874, 2884, 2885, 2888, 2889, 2900, 2905, 2907, 2909, 2911, 2912, 2922, 2923, 2924, 2929, 2930, 2932, 2934, 2936, 2937], "Excused": [2857, 2892, 2931, 2899]}}, {"bill_id": 17660, "action_date": "2003-02-28T13:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 98160, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/98160.pdf", "status_text": "Concur In resolution", "journal_page": 644, "committee_id_action": 799, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "F", "vote": {"vote_id": 55255, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [2832, 2834, 2838, 2847, 2853, 2856, 2876, 2878, 2881, 2882, 2883, 2886, 2901, 2916, 2921, 2926, 2927, 2928], "Excused": [2835, 2908], "Yea": [2840, 2849, 2850, 2851, 2852, 2854, 2865, 2868, 2880, 2887, 2891, 2897, 2903, 2904, 2935]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/17660"}
