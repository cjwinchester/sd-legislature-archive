However, all such decisions shall be made in accordance with accepted medical practice. Whenever making any health care decision for the principal, the attorney-in-fact or agent shall implement the express wishes of the principal, if known. If the express wishes of the principal are not known, the attorney in fact shall make the decision in good faith, shall not arbitrarily refuse consent, and shall consider the recommendation of the attending physician, the decision that the principal would have made if the principal then had decisional capacity, if known the inherent value of human life and its preservation , and the decision that would be in the best interest of the principal. Section 6. That \u00a7 59-7-2.7 be amended to read as follows: 59-7-2.7.

However, artificial nutrition or hydration may be withheld or withdrawn if: (1) Artificial nutrition or hydration is not needed for comfort care or the relief of pain and the attending physician reasonably believes that the principal's death will occur within approximately one week; or (2) Artificial nutrition or hydration cannot be physically assimilated by the principal; or (3) The burden of providing artificial nutrition or hydration outweighs its benefit, provided that the determination of burden refers to the provision of artificial nutrition or hydration itself and not to the quality of the continued life of the principal; or (4) There is clear and convincing evidence that artificial nutrition or hydration was refused by the person prior to loss of decisional capacity; or the power of attorney directs that artificial nutrition or hydration not be given or specifically authorizes the attorney-in-fact or agent to make that decision; or prior to the loss of decisional capacity there is clear and convincing evidence that the principal expressed the desire that artificial nutrition or hydration not be given. (1) In reasonable medical judgment; (a) The provision of artificial nutrition or hydration is not medically possible; (b) The provision of artificial nutrition or hydration would hasten death; or (c) The medical condition of the principal is such that provision of artificial nutrition or hydration would not contribute to sustaining life or providing comfort, hygiene, or relief of pain; (2) The principal has executed a living will or a durable power of attorney for healthcare, either of which specifically authorizes the withholding or withdrawal of artificial nutrition or hydration, to the extent that the authorization applies; (3) The principal has executed a written power of attorney pursuant to \u00a7 59-7-2.1 specifically authorizing the attorney-in-fact or agent to make that decision; or (4) There is a preponderance of the evidence that prior to the loss of decisional capacity, the principal either refused artificial nutrition or hydration or expressed the desire that artificial nutrition or hydration not be given in the applicable circumstances. Even in the exceptions listed in subdivisions (1), (2), (3) , and (4) of this section, artificial nutrition or hydration may not be withheld or withdrawn if it is needed for comfort , hygiene, or the relief of pain. Reasonable medical judgment means a medical judgment that would be made applying commonly accepted medical standards to the principal's case. Section 7. That chapter 59-7 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: If an individual with decisional capacity, or a durable power of attorney for health care or an attorney-in-fact or an agent, if authorized, directs the provision of life-sustaining treatment or artificial nutrition and hydration, any physician or health care provider who has responsibility for the treatment and care of the individual must provide the directed treatment or artificial nutrition and hydration in those circumstances so long as it is technically feasible. A physician or health care provider who objects to providing such treatment may instead transfer the individual to a physician or health care provider willing to honor the declaration, but must continue to provide the treatment or care until the transfer is effectuated. Section 8. Nothing in this Act shall render ineffective or change any of the terms of any decision made, oral directive given, or document executed pursuant to chapter 34-12C, 34-12D, or 59-7 prior to the effective date of this Act."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 19442, "action_date": "2005-01-31T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 103721, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/103721.pdf", "status_text": "First read in Senate and referred to", "journal_page": 247, "committee_id_action": 861, "committee_id_assigned": 839, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 19442, "action_date": "2005-02-07T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 104205, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/104205.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 839, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 19442, "action_date": "2005-02-09T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 104428, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/104428.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 839, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 19442, "action_date": "2005-02-09T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 104428, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/104428.pdf", "status_text": "Hog Housed", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 839, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 19442, "action_date": "2005-02-09T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 104428, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/104428.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to another day", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 839, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 19442, "action_date": "2005-02-16T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 104892, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/104892.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 839, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 19442, "action_date": "2005-02-16T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 104892, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/104892.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass Amended,", "journal_page": 525, "committee_id_action": 839, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 60227, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [3179, 3205, 3236, 3150], "Nay": [3201, 3202, 3217]}}, {"bill_id": 19442, "action_date": "2005-02-16T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 104892, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/104892.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass Amended,", "journal_page": 525, "committee_id_action": 839, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 60227, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [3179, 3205, 3236, 3150], "Nay": [3201, 3202, 3217]}}, {"bill_id": 19442, "action_date": "2005-02-17T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 105016, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/105016.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass Amended,", "journal_page": 549, "committee_id_action": 861, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "F", "vote": {"vote_id": 60309, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [3150, 3151, 3154, 3157, 3163, 3166, 3173, 3179, 3186, 3193, 3198, 3200, 3201, 3202, 3212, 3217, 3221, 3224, 3242, 3247], "Yea": [3152, 3153, 3165, 3168, 3180, 3185, 3204, 3205, 3210, 3214, 3219, 3228, 3236, 3239, 3241]}}]}
