BE IT RESOLVED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA, THE SENATE CONCURRING THEREIN: Section 1. That at the next general election held in the state, the following new sections to Article IX and amendments to Article IX, sections 1 and 2 of the Constitution of the State of South Dakota, as set forth in sections 2, 3, 4, and 5 of this Joint Resolution, which are hereby agreed to, shall be submitted to the electors of the state for approval. Section 2. That Article IX, section 1 of the Constitution, of the State of South Dakota, be amended to read as follows: \u00a7 1. The Legislature shall have plenary powers to organize and classify units of local government , except that any proposed change in county boundaries shall be submitted to the voters of each affected county at an election and be approved by a majority of those voting thereon in each county. No township heretofore organized may be abolished unless the question is submitted to the voters of the township and approved by a majority of those voting thereon in each township . After each decennial census, the Legislature shall apportion the state into not less than ten nor more than twelve counties and assign to each a county seat which the voter of the county may subsequently move by means of a special election called pursuant to a petition signed by fifteen percent of the voters of the county who voted in the last gubernatorial election. The counties based on Sioux Falls and Rapid City shall be as large as need be to encompass each conurbation. Each of the other counties shall be of relatively similar population, but in no case less than forty thousand. Section 3. That Article IX, section 2 of the Constitution, of the State of South Dakota, be amended to read as follows: \u00a7 2. Any county or city or combinations thereof may provide for the adoption or amendment of a charter. Such charter shall be adopted or amended if approved at an election by a majority of the votes cast thereon. Not less than ten percent of those voting in the last preceding gubernatorial election in the affected jurisdiction may by petition initiate the question of whether to adopt or amend a charter. A chartered governmental unit may exercise any legislative power or perform any function not denied by its charter, the Constitution, or the general laws of the state. The charter may provide for any form of executive, legislative, and administrative structure which shall be of superior authority to statute, provided that the legislative body so established be chosen by popular election and that the administrative proceedings be subject to judicial review. Powers and functions of home rule units shall be construed liberally. Section 4. That Article IX of the Constitution, of the State of South Dakota, be amended by adding a NEW SECTION to read as follows: \u00a7 8. The Legislature shall provide, by statute, for a system of charter government for all counties. Each county shall be governed by a council of not less than five nor more than fifteen council members, who shall be elected by districts. The term of a council member shall be four years; but the Legislature shall provide for approximately half of the initial terms to be two years to effectuate subsequent staggered elections. Each county shall also elect a chief executive officer to a four-year term. No county chief executive may serve more than two consecutive terms as a county chief executive officer even if the county has been substantially reapportioned. Section 5. That Article IX of the Constitution, of the State of South Dakota, be amended by adding a NEW SECTION to read as follows: \u00a7 9. Any city may provide for the adoption or amendment of a charter. Such charter shall be adopted or amended if approved at an election by a majority of the votes cast thereon. Not less than ten percent of those voting in the last preceding gubernatorial election in the affected jurisdiction may by petition initiate the question of whether to adopt or amend a charter. The charter may provide for any form of executive, legislative, and administrative structure which shall be of superior authority to statute, provided that the legislative body so established be chosen by popular election and that the administrative proceedings be subject to judicial review."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 16349, "action_date": "2001-01-25T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 88642, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/88642.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 209, "committee_id_action": 712, "committee_id_assigned": 707, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 16349, "action_date": "2001-02-07T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 89507, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/89507.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 707, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 16349, "action_date": "2001-02-07T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 89507, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/89507.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass,", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 707, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "F", "vote": {"vote_id": 49118, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [2526, 2540, 2588, 2593], "Nay": [2537, 2548, 2554, 2563, 2565, 2582, 2591], "Excused": [2538, 2604]}}, {"bill_id": 16349, "action_date": "2001-02-07T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 89507, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/89507.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass,", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 707, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "F", "vote": {"vote_id": 49118, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [2526, 2540, 2588, 2593], "Nay": [2537, 2548, 2554, 2563, 2565, 2582, 2591], "Excused": [2538, 2604]}}, {"bill_id": 16349, "action_date": "2001-02-07T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 89507, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/89507.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to another day", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 707, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 16349, "action_date": "2001-02-07T20:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 89620, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/89620.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass Amended,", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 707, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "F", "vote": {"vote_id": 49208, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [2526, 2538, 2540, 2588, 2593], "Nay": [2537, 2548, 2554, 2563, 2565, 2582, 2591, 2604]}}, {"bill_id": 16349, "action_date": "2001-02-07T20:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 89620, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/89620.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to 41st legislative day", "journal_page": 403, "committee_id_action": 707, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 49209, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [2526, 2540, 2582, 2588, 2593], "Yea": [2537, 2538, 2548, 2554, 2563, 2565, 2591, 2604]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/16349"}
