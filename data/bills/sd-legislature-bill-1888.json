For all documentation offered by the applicant to provide evidence of identity, date of birth, social security number or nonwork authorized status, address of principal residence, and lawful status, the department shall make a copy of the documentation and shall retain the copy for ten years. All documents retained under this section are confidential. The examiner may, as part of a documented exceptions process, accept other evidence of identity and date of birth of any applicant and lawful status of any United States citizen only if the examiner is satisfied that the applicant cannot, for good reason beyond the applicant's control, produce such primary documents. The examiner shall record the acceptance of any alternative document under the exceptions process. The Department of Public Safety may not require new evidence of birth at the time an application is made by a person holding an operator's license, motorcycle operator's license, restricted minor's permit, motorcycle restricted minor's permit, instruction permit, motorcycle instruction permit, or nondriver identification card, if that person's driver license or nondriver identification card meets the requirements of 6 C.F.R. Part 37 as amended through January 1, 2009, is acceptable by federal agencies for official purposes, and is turned in to the department with the application. Any person who obtains a driver license or nondriver identification card pursuant to this section fraudulently or by use of a fraudulently obtained document is guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor. Section 2. That \u00a7 32-12-3.5 be repealed. 32-12-3.5.
