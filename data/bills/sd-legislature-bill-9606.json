The expense of the actuarial determination of this amount shall be borne by the applicant. All eligible employees of an applicant shall participate in the system upon admission. If the unit is unable to deposit this amount in a single sum, the unit shall have the option to pay the amount by periodic level installments over a period up to twenty years, the value of which, when discounted for compound interest at the assumed rate of return, is equal to the amount due at the date of participation.
