The appointed co-trustee may not become a successor trustee upon the death, resignation, or incapacity of the appointing trustee, unless appointed under the terms of the governing instrument or unless no other successor trustee, or method for appointing a successor trustee, is provided in the governing instrument. The powers and the responsibilities of the appointed co-trustee may be limited by the appointing trustee in a writing signed by the appointing trustee at the time of the appointment.

However, this section does not limit the power of the trustee under law to petition the court for approval of the appointment. If no objection has been timely made, the proposed appointment shall go into effect on the later of the date set out in the notice or thirty days after notice has been given. The notice shall be mailed, postage prepaid, to the last known address of the trustor or current beneficiary. The provisions of this section are effective for trusts created before, on, or after July 1, 2017, except as otherwise directed by the trustor, trust protector, trust advisor, or other fiduciary designated by the terms of the trust.

Section 16. That \u00a7 55-1B-9 be amended to read: 55-1B-9. A trust instrument governed by the laws of South Dakota may provide for a person to act as an investment trust advisor or a distribution trust advisor, respectively, with regard to investment decisions or discretionary distributions. Unless otherwise provided or restricted by the terms of the governing instrument, any person may simultaneously serve as a trust advisor and a trust protector. Section 17. That \u00a7 55-2-13 be amended to read: 55-2-13. For purposes of this section, the term, qualified beneficiary, means a beneficiary that is an entity then in existence or an individual who is twenty-one years of age or older and who, on the date the beneficiary's qualification is determined: (1) Is a distributee or permissible distributee of trust income or principal; (2) Would be a distributee or permissible distributee of trust income or principal if the interests of the distributees terminated on that date; or (3) Would be a distributee or permissible distributee of trust income or principal if the trust terminated on that date. However, if the distributee is then unknown because a person holds a power to change the distributee, the trustee shall give notice only to the holder of the power. Except as otherwise provided by the terms of a revocable trust, a trustee has no duty to notify the qualified beneficiaries of the trust's existence. Except as otherwise provided by the terms of an irrevocable trust or otherwise directed in writing by the settlor, trust advisor, or trust protector, the trustee shall, within sixty days after the trustee has accepted trusteeship of the trust, or within sixty days after the date the trustee acquires knowledge that a formerly revocable trust has become irrevocable, notify the qualified beneficiaries of the trust's existence and of the right of the beneficiary to request a copy of the trust instrument pertaining to the beneficiary's interest in the trust. Except as otherwise provided by the terms of an irrevocable trust or otherwise directed in writing by the settlor, trust advisor, or trust protector, a trustee of an irrevocable trust: (1) Upon request of a qualified beneficiary, shall promptly furnish to the qualified beneficiary a copy of the trust instrument; (2) If notification of the trust has not been accomplished pursuant to this section within sixty days after accepting a trusteeship, shall notify the qualified beneficiaries of the acceptance and of the trustee's name, address, and telephone number; (3) Shall promptly respond to a qualified beneficiary's request for information related to the administration of the trust, unless the request is unreasonable under the circumstances. The settlor, trust advisor, or trust protector, may, by the terms of the governing instrument, or in writing delivered to the trustee, expand, restrict, eliminate, or otherwise modify the rights of beneficiaries to information relating to a trust. Written directions provided by the settlor, trust advisor, or trust protector as set forth in this section remain in effect until and unless the settlor, trust advisor, or trust protector revokes the written instructions or is incapacitated. Additionally, the written directions remain in effect only while the trust advisor or trust protector providing the written directions is serving as the current trust advisor or trust protector. Unless otherwise specifically provided in the written directions, upon the death or incapacity of a settlor who provided the written directions described in this section, the directions shall be deemed revoked. However, upon the death or incapacity of the settlor, a trust advisor or trust protector, if any, may further direct the trustee in writing pursuant to this section. Unless otherwise stated in the governing instrument, in the event of a conflict in direction, the direction of the settlor shall control. A beneficiary may waive the right to the notice or information otherwise required to be furnished under this section and, with respect to future reports and other information, may withdraw a waiver previously given. The change in the identity of a trustee, occurring as the result of a mere name change or a merger, consolidation, combination, or reorganization of a trustee, does not require notice. If a fiduciary is bound by a duty of confidentiality with respect to a trust or its assets, a fiduciary may require that any beneficiary who is eligible to receive information pursuant to this section be bound by the duty of confidentiality that binds the trustee before receiving such information from the trustee. A trust advisor, trust protector, or other fiduciary designated by the terms of the trust shall keep each excluded fiduciary designated by the terms of the trust reasonably informed about: (1) The administration of the trust with respect to any specific duty or function being performed by the trust advisor, trust protector, or other fiduciary to the extent that the duty or function would normally be performed by the excluded fiduciary or to the extent that providing such information to the excluded fiduciary is reasonably necessary for the excluded fiduciary to perform its duties; and (2) Any other material information that the excluded fiduciary would be required to disclose to the qualified beneficiaries under this section regardless of whether the terms of the trust relieve the excluded fiduciary from providing such information to qualified beneficiaries. Neither the performance nor the failure to perform of a trust advisor, trust protector, or other fiduciary designated by the terms of the trust as provided in this subdivision shall affect the limitation on the liability of the excluded fiduciary. The provisions of this section are effective for trusts created after June 30, 2002, except as otherwise directed by the settlor, trust protector, trust advisor, or other fiduciary designated by the terms of the trust. For trusts created before July 1, 2002, a trustee has no duty at common law or otherwise to notify a qualified beneficiary of the trust's existence unless otherwise directed by the settlor. Section 18. That \u00a7 55-2-15 be amended to read: 55-2-15. Unless the terms of the governing instrument expressly provide otherwise, if a trustee has discretion under the terms of a governing instrument to make a distribution of income or principal to or for the benefit of one or more beneficiaries of a trust (the \"first trust\"), whether or not restricted by any standard, then the trustee, independently or with court approval, may exercise such discretion by appointing part or all of the income or principal subject to the discretion in favor of a trustee of a second trust (the \"second trust\") under a governing instrument separate from the governing instrument of the first trust. Before exercising its discretion to appoint and distribute assets to a second trust, the trustee of the first trust shall determine whether the appointment is necessary or desirable after taking into account the purposes of the first trust, the terms and conditions of the second trust, and the consequences of the distribution. For the purposes of this section, a trustee of the first trust is a restricted trustee if either the trustee is a beneficiary of the first trust or if a beneficiary of the first trust has a power to change the trustees within the meaning of \u00a7 55-2-17. In addition, the following apply to all appointments made under this section: (1) The second trust may only have as beneficiaries one or more of the beneficiaries of the first trust: (a) To or for whom a discretionary distribution of income or principal may be made from the first trust; or (b) To or for whom a distribution of income or principal may be made in the future from the first trust at a time or upon the happening of an event specified under the first trust; or (c) Both (a) and (b); (2) No restricted trustee of the first trust may exercise such authority over the first trust to the extent that doing so could have the effect of: (a) Benefiting the restricted trustee as a beneficiary of the first trust, unless the exercise of such authority is limited by an ascertainable standard based on or related to health, education, maintenance, or support; or (b) Removing restrictions on discretionary distributions to a beneficiary imposed by the governing instrument under which the first trust was created, except that a provision in the second trust which limits distributions by an ascertainable standard based on or related to the health, education, maintenance, or support of any such beneficiary is permitted, or to a trust established pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396(p)(d)(4); (3) No restricted trustee of the first trust may exercise such authority over the first trust to the extent that doing so would have the effect of increasing the distributions that can be made from the second trust to the restricted trustees of the first trust or to a beneficiary who may change the trustees of the first trust within the meaning of \u00a7 55-2-17 compared to the distributions that can be made to such trustee or beneficiary, as the case may be, under the first trust, unless the exercise of such authority is limited by an ascertainable standard based on or related to health, education, maintenance, or support; (4) The provisions of subdivisions (2) and (3) only apply to restrict the authority of a trustee if either a trustee, or a beneficiary who may change the trustee, is a United States citizen or domiciliary under the Internal Revenue Code, or the trust owns property that would be subject to United States estate or gift taxes if owned directly by such a person; (5) In the case of any trust contributions which have been treated as gifts qualifying for the exclusion from gift tax described in \u00a7 2503(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, by reason of the application of I.R.C. \u00a7 2503(c), the governing instrument for the second trust shall provide that the beneficiary's remainder interest shall vest no later than the date upon which such interest would have vested under the terms of the governing instrument for the first trust; (6) The exercise of such authority may not reduce any income interest of any income beneficiary of any of the following trusts: (a) A trust for which a marital deduction has been taken for federal tax purposes under I.R.C. \u00a7 2056 or \u00a7 2523 or for state tax purposes under any comparable provision of applicable state law; (b) A charitable remainder trust under I.R.C. \u00a7 664; or (c) A grantor retained annuity or unitrust trust under I.R.C. \u00a7 2702; (7) The exercise of such authority does not apply to trust property subject to a presently exercisable power of withdrawal held by a trust beneficiary to whom, or for the benefit of whom, the trustee has authority to make distributions, unless after the exercise of such authority, the beneficiary's power of withdrawal is unchanged with respect to the trust property; (8) The exercise of such authority is not prohibited by a spendthrift clause or by a provision in the governing instrument that prohibits amendment or revocation of the trust; (9) Any appointment made by a trustee shall be considered a distribution by the trustee pursuant to the trustee's distribution powers and authority; and (10) If the trustee's distribution discretion is not subject to a standard, or if the trustee's distribution discretion is subject to a standard that does not create a support interest, then the court may review the trustee's determination or any related appointment only pursuant to \u00a7 55-1-43. Any other court review of the trustee's determination or any related appointment may be made only pursuant to \u00a7 55-1-42. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section, the governing instrument of the second trust may grant a power of appointment to one or more of the beneficiaries of the second trust who are beneficiaries of the first trust. The power of appointment may include the power to appoint trust property to the holder of the power of appointment, the holder's creditors, the holder's estate, the creditors of the holder's estate, or any other person, whether or not that person is a trust beneficiary. Furthermore, notwithstanding the provisions of this section or \u00a7 55-2-18 or 55-2-19, a trustee may also exercise the power described in those sections by modifying the first trust without an actual distribution of property, in which case the second trust is the modified first trust. In exercising the power described by the preceding sentence of this section, a trustee shall notify all beneficiaries of the trust, in writing, at least twenty days prior to the effective date of the trustee's exercise of the power. This section applies to any trust administered under the laws of this state, including a trust whose governing jurisdiction is transferred to this state. Section 19.

If any beneficiary does not consent to a requested modification or termination of a trust by the other beneficiaries or by the trustor and other beneficiaries, the court, with the consent of the other beneficiaries, and of the trustor, if required, may approve a requested modification or partial termination if the rights or interests of the beneficiaries who do not consent are not significantly impaired or adversely affected. Upon modification or partial termination of the trust, the trustee shall distribute the trust property as ordered by the court. Section 20. That \u00a7 55-4-10 be amended to read: 55-4-10.

(b) Upon the death of the settlor of a trust that was revocable at the settlor's death, the trustee may proceed to distribute the trust property in accordance with the terms of the trust. The trustee is not subject to liability for doing so unless: (1) The trustee knows of a pending proceeding contesting the validity of the trust; or (2) A potential contestant has notified the trustee of a possible proceeding to contest the trust and a proceeding is commenced within sixty days after the contestant sent the notification.
