The provisions of \u00a7 32-23-7 shall may not be construed as limiting the introduction of any other competent evidence bearing upon the question whether or not the defendant was under the influence of intoxicating liquor an alcoholic beverage . Section 15. That chapter 32-23 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Any driving permit issued by the court to any person, who has been convicted of a violation of \u00a7 32-23-1 within the last ten years or any driving permit issued pursuant to \u00a7 32-23-2, if that person had 0.17 percent or more by weight of alcohol in that person's blood, shall be conditioned on the person's total abstinence from the use of alcohol. The court shall immediately revoke the permit upon a showing of proof by a preponderance of the evidence that the person has violated this condition. Section 16. That \u00a7 22-16-41 be amended to read as follows: 22-16-41. Any person who, while under the influence of an alcoholic beverage, any controlled drug or substance, marijuana, or a combination thereof, without design to effect death, operates or drives a motor vehicle of any kind in a negligent manner and thereby causes the death of another person, including an unborn child, is guilty of vehicular homicide. Vehicular homicide is a Class 3 felony. In addition to any other penalty prescribed by law, the court may also order that the driver's license of any person convicted of vehicular homicide be revoked for such period of time as may be determined by the court shall order that the driver's license of any person convicted of vehicular homicide be revoked for a period of not less than ten years from the date sentence is imposed or ten years from the date of initial release from imprisonment, whichever is later. In the event the person is returned to imprisonment prior to the completion of the period of driver's license revocation, time spent imprisoned does not count toward fulfilling the period of revocation . Section 17. That \u00a7 22-18-36 be amended to read as follows: 22-18-36. Any person who, while under the influence of an alcoholic beverage, any controlled drug or substance, marijuana, or a combination thereof, without design to effect serious bodily injury, operates or drives a motor vehicle of any kind in a negligent manner and thereby causes the serious bodily injury of another person, including an unborn child, is guilty of vehicular battery. Vehicular battery is a Class 4 felony. In addition to any other penalty prescribed by law, the court may also order that the driver's license of any person convicted of vehicular battery be revoked for a period of two years subsequent to release from incarceration shall order that the driver's license of any person convicted of vehicular battery be revoked for a period of not less than three years from the date sentence is imposed or three years from the date of initial release from imprisonment, whichever is later. In the event the person is returned to imprisonment prior to the completion of the period of driver's license revocation, time spent imprisoned does not count toward fulfilling the period of revocation ."}, {"bill_id": 20556, "bill_version_id": 109398, "bill_version": "Enrolled", "bill_version_date": "2006-02-24T14:38:20-06:00", "bill_text": ""}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [],
