Section 5. The Legislature finds that it is the duty of the Legislature to enact all measures as may be necessary to prevent the enforcement of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (H.R. 3590; Pub. L. No. 111-148) as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (H.R. 4872; Pub. L. No. 111-152) within the boundaries of this state. Section 6. No official, agent, or employee of the United States government nor any employee of any entity providing services to the United States government may enforce or attempt to enforce the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (H.R. 3590; Pub. L. No. 111-148) as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (H.R. 4872; Pub. L.

No. 111-148) as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (H.R. 4872; Pub. L.
