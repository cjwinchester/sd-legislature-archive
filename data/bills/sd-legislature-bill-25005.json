Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of South Dakota: Section 1. That \u00a7 32-5B-11 be AMENDED: 32-5B-11. If any motor vehicle has been subjected previously to a sales tax, use tax, motor vehicle excise tax, or similar tax by this or any other state or its political subdivision, no tax is owed to this state if the tax has been paid by the applicant to this or any other state or its political subdivision. Additionally, any part used in a rebuilt motor vehicle or motor vehicle manufactured by an applicant, previously subjected to sales tax, use tax, motor vehicle excise tax, or similar tax by this or any other state or its political subdivision, is not subject to the tax levied by this chapter, if the applicant applies for registration of the motor vehicle in this state within five years from the purchase date of the part. If the amount of tax levied and paid is the same or more than the amount of tax levied by this chapter, no tax or refund is due under this chapter. The county treasurer shall require of all applicants making application for registration of a motor vehicle in this state an affidavit of a licensed dealer, bill of sale, receipt, or other tangible evidence that the amount of tax has been paid by the current applicant. If sufficient proof is not furnished, the county treasurer shall must collect the tax levied by \u00a7 32-5B-1 on the retail value of the motor vehicle listed in the National Automobile Dealers' Used Car Guide (NADA) a national motor vehicle valuation service. The value shall must be the retail value of the motor vehicle on the day it entered the state. If a motor vehicle, after being taxed by this chapter or granted an exemption from part or all of the motor vehicle excise tax by this provision section, is sold or traded, the vehicle does not again qualify for an exemption by this provision section, if the vehicle is repurchased by the same applicant."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": []}
