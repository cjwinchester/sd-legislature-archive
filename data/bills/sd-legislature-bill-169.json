As to each loan or transaction, the rights and obligations of the member are the same as those of a person who is not a member, subject to other applicable law.

Section 13. That \u00a7 47-34A-504 be amended to read as follows: 47-34A-504.

(f) No creditor of a member or a member's assignee has any right to obtain possession of, or otherwise exercise legal or equitable remedies with respect to, the property of the company.

(e) After making a determination under subsection (d), a special litigation committee shall file with the court a statement of the committees determination and the committee's report supporting the determination, giving notice to the plaintiff.
