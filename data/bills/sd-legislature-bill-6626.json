BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That chapter 41-9 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Any person who trespasses in violation of \u00a7 22-35-6 while en route to a hunting, fishing, or trapping area for the purpose of hunting, fishing, or trapping is subject to \u00a7 41-9-8. Section 2. That \u00a7 41-9-8 be amended to read as follows: 41-9-8. Any person who knowingly enters or remains on private property for the purpose of hunting, fishing, or trapping, in violation of \u00a7 41-9-1 or 41-9-2, or as provided in section 1 of this Act, shall lose hunting, trapping, or fishing privileges for one year following the conviction. The sentencing court may order the revocation of hunting, fishing, or trapping privileges authorized by this section to be served consecutively with any other revocation of the person's hunting, fishing, or trapping privileges imposed for a violation for which the person is convicted and for which revocation of the privileges is authorized under this title. If the person is the holder of a license to hunt, trap, or fish, the court shall require the license holder to surrender and deliver the license to the court to be returned to the Department of Game, Fish and Parks. For the purpose of this section, the term, guilty, has the same meaning as the term, conviction, in \u00a7 32-12-53. Unarmed retrieval of lawfully taken small game from either private land or land controlled by the Department of Game, Fish and Parks or other public lands, is not a crime or petty offense, if the retrieval of the small game does not involve the use of a motor vehicle. It is a Class 2 misdemeanor for any person, while engaged in the retrieval of small game from private land without permission of the landowner or lessee of the land, to intentionally drive or flush any small game located on the land toward other hunters of the retriever's same hunting group located on other parcels of land or rights-of-way. It is a Class 2 misdemeanor for any person, who is a member of the same hunting group as the person performing the retrieval without the permission of the landowner or lessee of the land, to intentionally discharge a firearm at small game, except waterfowl, that originates from the private land during the retrieval. This section does not limit the civil remedies available to any landowner."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 6626, "action_date": "2015-01-28T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 34034, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/34034.pdf", "status_text": "First read in Senate and referred to", "journal_page": 212, "committee_id_action": 284, "committee_id_assigned": 260, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 6626, "action_date": "2015-02-10T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 34541, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/34541.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 260, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 6626, "action_date": "2015-02-10T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 34801, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/34801.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass", "journal_page": 353, "committee_id_action": 260, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 18462, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [858, 860, 901, 862, 880, 900, 878, 856], "Excused": [902]}}, {"bill_id": 6626, "action_date": "2015-02-11T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 34923, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/34923.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass", "journal_page": 381, "committee_id_action": 284, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "F", "vote": {"vote_id": 18588, "president_vote": null, "Excused": [853, 943], "Nay": [854, 855, 858, 894, 903, 876, 885, 896, 898, 890, 942, 891, 893, 886, 880, 902, 877, 868, 892, 873, 897], "Yea": [856, 860, 889, 899, 901, 895, 900, 862, 944, 871, 872, 878]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/6626"}
