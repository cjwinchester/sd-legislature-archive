That chapter 32-28 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: A person operating a motorcycle who violates \u00a7 32-28-10 by entering or crossing an intersection controlled by a traffic-control device against a red light has an affirmative defense to that charge if the person establishes all of the following conditions: (1) The motorcycle has been brought to a complete stop; (2) The traffic-control device continues to show a red light for an unreasonable time; (3) The traffic-control device is apparently malfunctioning or, if programmed or engineered to change to a green light only after detecting the approach of a motor vehicle, the device has apparently failed to detect the arrival of the motorcycle; and (4) No motor vehicle or person is approaching on the street or highway to be crossed or entered or is so far away from the intersection that it does not constitute an immediate hazard. The affirmative defense in this section applies only to a violation for entering or crossing an intersection controlled by a traffic-control device against a red light and does not provide a defense to any other civil or criminal action."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 724, "action_date": "2009-01-29T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 6340, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/6340.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 193, "committee_id_action": 56, "committee_id_assigned": 52, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 724, "action_date": "2009-02-04T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 6564, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/6564.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 52, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 724, "action_date": "2009-02-09T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 6820, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/6820.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 52, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 724, "action_date": "2009-02-11T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 7029, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/7029.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 52, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 724, "action_date": "2009-02-13T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 7221, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/7221.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 52, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 724, "action_date": "2009-02-13T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 7425, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/7425.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to the 41st legislative day", "journal_page": 375, "committee_id_action": 52, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 4069, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [651, 660, 693], "Excused": [725, 729], "Yea": [724, 727, 652, 695, 722, 714, 691, 699]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/724"}
