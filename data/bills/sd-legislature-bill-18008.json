WHEREAS, South Dakota's Youth Pheasant Season has been a popular program that allows young hunters aged twelve to fifteen to hunt pheasants during the weekend before the regular pheasant season opens if they are accompanied by an unarmed adult; and WHEREAS, in 2002, South Dakota instituted an Early Resident-Only Pheasant season to allow resident hunters the opportunity to hunt pheasants on public land during the weekend before the regular pheasant season opens; and WHEREAS, the Youth and Early Resident-Only hunts have been very successful in providing quality hunting opportunities for South Dakota residents before the start of the regular season without competition and congestion from out-of-state hunters; and WHEREAS, these hunting opportunities have been helpful and should continue, but some difficulties have been encountered because both the Youth and Early Resident-Only hunts fall on the same dates. These include such occasional problems as distinguishing between adults accompanying youth hunters and adults hunting on their own, competition for youth hunters from adults on public land, and confusion over hunting hours, with the youth season opening at sunrise and the resident-only season beginning at noon; and WHEREAS, these problems could be minimized and the quality of the Youth Pheasant Season and the Early Resident-Only Pheasant Season could be improved if the two seasons were held on different dates and if shooting hours were standardized to follow the traditional noon starting time: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the House of Representatives of the Seventy- eighth Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the Senate concurring therein, that the Legislature recommends and requests that the Game, Fish and Parks Commission schedule the Youth Pheasant Season on the Saturday and Sunday before the opening of the regular pheasant season and the Early Resident-Only Pheasant Season on the Monday and Tuesday before the opening of the regular pheasant season, with the shooting hours for both seasons to begin at noon."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 18008, "action_date": "2003-01-30T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 96215, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/96215.pdf", "status_text": "Adopt Resolution", "journal_page": 219, "committee_id_action": 798, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 56532, "president_vote": null, "Excused": [2833, 2934], "Yea": [2836, 2837, 2839, 2841, 2842, 2843, 2844, 2845, 2846, 2848, 2855, 2857, 2858, 2859, 2860, 2861, 2862, 2863, 2864, 2866, 2869, 2870, 2871, 2872, 2873, 2874, 2875, 2877, 2879, 2885, 2888, 2889, 2890, 2892, 2893, 2894, 2895, 2896, 2898, 2900, 2902, 2905, 2906, 2907, 2909, 2910, 2911, 2912, 2913, 2914, 2915, 2917, 2919, 2920, 2922, 2923, 2924, 2925, 2929, 2930, 2931, 2932, 2933, 2936, 2937, 2938, 2899], "Nay": [2884]}}, {"bill_id": 18008, "action_date": "2003-02-03T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 96443, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/96443.pdf", "status_text": "Referred to", "journal_page": 285, "committee_id_action": 799, "committee_id_assigned": 772, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 18008, "action_date": "2003-02-11T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 96957, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/96957.pdf", "status_text": "Concur In resolution", "journal_page": 420, "committee_id_action": 772, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 56458, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [2847, 2881], "Excused": [2849, 2928], "Yea": [2886, 2887, 2891, 2852, 2851]}}, {"bill_id": 18008, "action_date": "2003-02-11T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 96957, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/96957.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 772, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 18008, "action_date": "2003-02-12T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 97096, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/97096.pdf", "status_text": "Concur In resolution", "journal_page": 428, "committee_id_action": 799, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "F", "vote": {"vote_id": 54460, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [2832, 2835, 2847, 2849, 2850, 2856, 2865, 2878, 2881, 2882, 2883, 2886, 2897, 2901, 2908, 2916, 2921, 2926, 2927, 2935], "Yea": [2834, 2838, 2840, 2851, 2852, 2853, 2854, 2868, 2876, 2880, 2887, 2891, 2903, 2904, 2928]}}]}
