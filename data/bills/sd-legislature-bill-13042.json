Section 2. The Department of Human Services shall establish and administer a statewide television access program for persons who are deaf or hard of hearing.

There is created in the state treasury, the television access fund for the deaf or hard of hearing for the deposit of money collected under the provisions of this Act, necessary to cover the costs of providing closed and real time captioning and interpreting service, including the cost of implementing and administering this Act. Any money in the fund is continuously appropriated for the purposes of this Act. Section 4.

The secretary of revenue may grant an extension of not more than five days for filing a remittance. The Department of Revenue shall deposit the money received under this Act into the television access fund for the deaf and hard of hearing. Section 6. No single customer of a CATV system provider is required to pay the television access fee on more than one hundred cable service lines per account in this state. Section 7. No CATV system provider has any obligation to take any legal action to enforce the collection of any charge imposed pursuant to this Act. The CATV system provider is not liable for such uncollected amounts. Section 8. The access fee imposed in section 5 of this Act is subject to annual review by the Department of Human Services. Each year the department shall report to the Legislature and recommend whether the access fee should be increased or decreased in order that the money raised by the access fee pays for the costs of the program. Section 9. The CATV system provider may retain one percent of the collected amount, as the cost of administration for collecting the charge. Section 10. The secretary of the Department of Human Services may accept and expend for the purpose of this Act, in addition to the amount in section 5 of this Act, any funds obtained from federal sources, gifts, contributions, or any other source if such acceptance and expenditure is approved in accordance with \u00a7 4-8B-10.
