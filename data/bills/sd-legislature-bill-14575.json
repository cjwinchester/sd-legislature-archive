BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 3-12-83 be amended to read as follows: 3-12-83. A current contributing member of the system may receive credited service by election to make, or have made on his the member's behalf, contributions, based on the higher of his the member's current compensation, or his the member's final compensation calculated as if he the member had retired on the date of election, at seventy-five percent of twice the member rate, for each year of service for which he the member wishes to receive credit, if: (1) The current contributing member of the system could have established credit for any South Dakota public service by making contributions under this chapter or any prior law; or (2) The current contributing member was not permitted to establish credit for any South Dakota public service. The amount of the credited service and the rate of contribution shall be at class A rates unless the service for which credit is sought was rendered as a class B member in which case class B rates shall apply. If a participating unit has failed to pay employer or member contributions to the system on behalf of a member as required under this chapter or under any predecessor system consolidated pursuant to \u00a7 3-12-46, the amount due the system shall be calculated in accordance with this section. However, any former elective official who wishes to purchase service for which the official elected not to participate, pursuant to \u00a7 3-12-63, shall make all contributions personally; no contributions may be made on the official's behalf."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 14575, "action_date": "1999-01-26T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 82144, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/82144.pdf", "status_text": "First read in Senate and referred to", "journal_page": 195, "committee_id_action": 629, "committee_id_assigned": 610, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 14575, "action_date": "1999-02-03T15:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 82077, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/82077.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 610, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 14575, "action_date": "1999-02-03T15:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 82077, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/82077.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to 41st legislative day", "journal_page": 333, "committee_id_action": 610, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 43081, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [2199, 2283, 2206], "Excused": [2259], "Nay": [2274]}}]}
