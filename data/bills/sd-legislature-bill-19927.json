BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That chapter 10-6 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: If agricultural land has been degraded by prairie dogs, the landowner or the landowner's agent or attorney may request the director of equalization to specially assess the land for the purpose of taxation by submitting an application before November first. The application shall describe the portion of the agricultural land that was neither arable nor suitable for grazing during the past growing season because of degradation by prairie dogs. If the director of equalization, in considering the application, determines that the land has been degraded by prairie dogs so that it was neither arable nor suitable for grazing during the past growing season, the director of equalization shall make adjustments in setting the assessed value for agricultural land and shall use the lowest soils rating classification pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 10-6-33.2 and 10-6-33.7 to determine the assessed value of the acreage degraded by prairie dogs. 300 copies of this document were printed by the South Dakota Legislative Research Council at a cost of $.029 per page. .
