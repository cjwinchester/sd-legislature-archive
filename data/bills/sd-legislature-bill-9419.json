BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 25-7-6.10 be amended to read: 25-7-6.10. Deviation from the schedule in \u00a7 25-7-6.2 shall be considered if raised by either party and made only upon the entry of specific findings based upon any of the following factors: (1) The income of a subsequent spouse or contribution of a third party to the income or expenses of that parent but only if the application of the schedule works a financial hardship on either parent; (2) Any financial condition of either parent which would make application of the schedule inequitable. If the total amount of the child support obligation, including any adjustments for health insurance and child care costs, exceeds fifty forty percent of the obligor's monthly net income, it is presumed that the amount of the obligation imposes a financial hardship on the obligor. This presumption may be rebutted based upon other factors set forth in this section; (3) Any necessary education or health care special needs of the child; (4) The effect of agreements between the parents regarding extra forms of support for the direct benefit of the child; (5) The obligation of either parent to provide for subsequent natural children, adopted children, or stepchildren. However, an existing support order may not be modified solely for this reason; or (6) The voluntary and unreasonable act of a parent which causes the parent to be unemployed or underemployed, unless the reduction of income is due to incarceration."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 9419, "action_date": "2019-01-25T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 52449, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/52449.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 193, "committee_id_action": 408, "committee_id_assigned": 410, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 9419, "action_date": "2019-02-06T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 52515, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/52515.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 410, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 9419, "action_date": "2019-02-11T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 53038, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/53038.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 410, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 9419, "action_date": "2019-02-20T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 53054, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/53054.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 410, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 9419, "action_date": "2019-02-22T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 53953, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/53953.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 410, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 9419, "action_date": "2019-02-22T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 54164, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/54164.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 410, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "F", "vote": {"vote_id": 28712, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [1619, 1643, 1645, 1637, 1629, 1436, 1635], "Yea": [1650, 1556, 1446, 1626, 1610], "Excused": [1638]}}, {"bill_id": 9419, "action_date": "2019-02-22T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 54164, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/54164.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to the 41st legislative day", "journal_page": 500, "committee_id_action": 410, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 28713, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [1619, 1643, 1645, 1650, 1637, 1629, 1638, 1436, 1635], "Nay": [1556, 1446, 1626, 1610]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/9419"}
