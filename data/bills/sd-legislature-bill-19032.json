BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 10-3-16 be amended to read as follows: 10-3-16. The director of equalization shall assess for taxation all property subject to taxation, except property which the secretary of revenue and regulation has been directed to assess, which is situated in the county or municipality for which the director is appointed, including all property located within the corporate limits of each municipality. No legal presumption of correctness attaches to the director's assessed valuation of property. If any property owner provides appraisals from two or more licensed appraisers that have determined a valuation of the property that is less than the director's assessed valuation, the presumption of correctness attaches to the highest valuation completed on behalf of the property owner. Each county in this state is an assessment district. 350 copies of this document were printed by the South Dakota Legislative Research Council at a cost of $.027 per page. . Insertions into existing statutes are indicated by underscores. Deletions from existing statutes are indicated by overstrikes."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 19032, "action_date": "2004-01-26T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 99935, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/99935.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 206, "committee_id_action": 831, "committee_id_assigned": 827, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 19032, "action_date": "2004-01-29T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 100233, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/100233.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 827, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 19032, "action_date": "2004-01-29T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 100233, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/100233.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to 36th legislative day", "journal_page": 283, "committee_id_action": 827, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 58758, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [3057, 3073, 3078, 3085, 3088, 3100, 3102, 3110, 3127, 3140, 3142, 3143, 3147, 3095, 3148]}}]}
