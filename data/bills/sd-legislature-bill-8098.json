BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 13-36-7 be amended to read: 13-36-7. Any student enrolling in a South Dakota district pursuant to \u00a7 13-15-21 is eligible to participate in any interscholastic activity sponsored by the South Dakota High School Activities Association. If the school board or governing body of an accredited school approves, a A student receiving alternative instruction pursuant to \u00a7 13-27-3 is eligible to participate in any interscholastic activity sponsored by the South Dakota High School Activities Association. However, the school board or governing body of the school in which a student receiving alternative instruction participates in the interscholastic activity may require the student to enroll in no more than one course during the school year in which the participation occurs. Nothing in this section confers any vested right in any student wishing to participate in any interscholastic activity to be selected for competition in such activity. However, any accredited school student who leaves an accredited program during the course of the school year for any reason and enters an alternative instruction program is ineligible for participation in interscholastic activities for one year beginning on the date in which the student enters the alternative program."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 8098, "action_date": "2017-01-26T13:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 43351, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/43351.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 215, "committee_id_action": 361, "committee_id_assigned": 349, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 8098, "action_date": "2017-02-06T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 43740, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/43740.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 349, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 8098, "action_date": "2017-02-06T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 43912, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/43912.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to the 41st legislative day", "journal_page": 305, "committee_id_action": 349, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 22903, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [1150, 1203, 1201, 1118, 1212], "Yea": [1156, 1195, 1185, 1198, 1180, 1128, 1158, 1176, 1181, 1120]}}]}
