WHEREAS, the United States Supreme Court in Tinker v. Des Moines Independent School District said that students are free to express religious belief or nonbelief in compositions, art forms, music, speech, and debate. Students may verbally express their ideas and distribute literature to other students during noninstructional time if their speech or the distribution of literature is not disruptive to the ordinary operation of the school and does not infringe on the rights of other students; and WHEREAS, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in Jones v. Clear Creek Independent Schools that school officials may not prevent a graduation speaker, a student, or other person from voluntarily praying; and WHEREAS, the federal Equal Access Act, upheld by the United States Supreme Court in Board of Education v. Mergens, ensures equal access for student-initiated meetings that are religious, political, or philosophical in nature; and WHEREAS, the United States Supreme Court decision in Zorach v. Clauson ruled that schools may offer a release time for students to leave the public school facilities for off-site instruction, including religious instruction conducted by nonschool personnel; and WHEREAS, the Legislature recognizes the free speech rights of students in public school. Students on public school campuses have the right to express their ideas verbally and through the distribution of literature if their speech does not disrupt the ordinary operation of the school; and WHEREAS, the United States Supreme Court decision in Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches Union Free School District said that the use of school facilities before or after the official school day must be offered on an equal and nondiscriminatory basis even if the requester is a religious organization. The Lamb's Chapel decision is reinforced by the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals decision in Barbara Wigg v. Sioux Falls School District; and WHEREAS, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals held in Florey v. Sioux Falls School District that religious songs and symbols may be used in the public schools if they are presented in a \"prudent and objective manner and only as part of the cultural and religious heritage of the holiday.\" The Florey decision also recognizes that the several holidays throughout the year that have a religious basis may be observed in the public schools, and that the historical and contemporary values and the origin of religious holidays may be explained in an unbiased and objective manner without sectarian indoctrination; and WHEREAS, the Florey Court also stated that the study and performance of religious songs is constitutional if the purpose is the \"advancement of the students' knowledge of society's cultural and religious heritage, as well as the provision of an opportunity for students to perform a full range of music, poetry, and drama that is likely to be of interest to the students and their audience\"; and WHEREAS, the United States Supreme Court in School District of Abington Township v. Schempp said, \"It certainly may be said that the Bible is worthy of study for its literary and historic qualities. Nothing we have said here indicates that such study of the Bible or of religion, when presented objectively as part of a secular program of education, may not be effected consistently with the First Amendment.\"; and WHEREAS, the United States Supreme Court in Stone v. Graham said, \"The Bible may constitutionally be used in an appropriate study of history, civilization, ethics, comparative religion, or the like.\"; and WHEREAS, the Bible was an important book in the early history of this country. It is possible to establish a curriculum that evaluates the role of the Bible in this country and in western civilization that is constitutional. The Bible is also considered to be literature from antiquity. A school board could establish a policy that allows the Bible to be discussed as part of a literature program in the school; and WHEREAS, SDCL 13-24-17.1 states that the Ten Commandments may be displayed in any public school along with other objects and documents of cultural, legal, or historical significance that have formed and influenced the legal and governmental systems of the United States and the State of South Dakota; and WHEREAS, Article VI, section 3 of the South Dakota Constitution states, \"The right to worship God according to the dictates of conscience shall never be infringed. No person shall be denied any civil or political right, privilege, or position on account of his religious opinions....\": NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the House of Representatives of the Eightieth Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the Senate concurring therein, that the South Dakota Legislature urges public schools to exercise due diligence to ensure that the freedom of religious expression afforded in state and federal law and supported in numerous judicial decisions is not inhibited."}, {"bill_id": 20028, "bill_version_id": 104944, "bill_version": "Enrolled", "bill_version_date": "2005-02-17T08:51:59-06:00", "bill_text": ""}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 20028, "action_date": "2005-02-11T13:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 104618, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/104618.pdf", "status_text": "Introduced", "journal_page": 442, "committee_id_action": 860, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 20028, "action_date": "2005-02-14T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 104701, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/104701.pdf", "status_text": "Adopt Resolution", "journal_page": 461, "committee_id_action": 860, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 61997, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [3155, 3156, 3158, 3159, 3160, 3161, 3162, 3164, 3167, 3169, 3170, 3171, 3172, 3174, 3175, 3176, 3177, 3178, 3181, 3182, 3183, 3184, 3187, 3188, 3189, 3190, 3191, 3192, 3194, 3195, 3196, 3197, 3199, 3203, 3206, 3207, 3209, 3211, 3213, 3216, 3218, 3220, 3222, 3223, 3225, 3226, 3227, 3229, 3230, 3231, 3232, 3233, 3234, 3235, 3237, 3238, 3240, 3243, 3244, 3245, 3246, 3248, 3251, 3252, 3253, 3254, 3255, 3215], "Excused": [3208, 3249]}}, {"bill_id": 20028, "action_date": "2005-02-15T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 104814, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/104814.pdf", "status_text": "Introduced", "journal_page": 491, "committee_id_action": 861, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 20028, "action_date": "2005-02-16T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 104922, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/104922.pdf", "status_text": "Concur In resolution", "journal_page": 515, "committee_id_action": 861, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 60208, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [3150, 3151, 3152, 3153, 3154, 3157, 3163, 3165, 3166, 3168, 3173, 3179, 3180, 3185, 3186, 3193, 3198, 3200, 3201, 3202, 3204, 3205, 3210, 3212, 3214, 3217, 3219, 3221, 3224, 3228, 3236, 3239, 3241, 3242, 3247]}}]}
