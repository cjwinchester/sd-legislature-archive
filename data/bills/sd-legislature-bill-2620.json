A person is liable to the purchaser if the person sells a security in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 47-31B-301 or 47-31B-501, by means of an untrue statement of a material fact or an omission to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statement made, in light of the circumstances under which it is made, not misleading, the purchaser not knowing the untruth or omission and the seller not sustaining the burden of proof that the seller did not know and, in the exercise of reasonable care, could not have known of the untruth or omission of material fact. An action under this subsection is governed by the following: (1) A seller of a security to the purchaser in violation of \u00a7 47-31B-501, if the security, or its underlying asset or collateral, when offered, sold, or purchased in this state, was subject to, bound by, or otherwise controlled by a foreign law, in which any part of that foreign law, relevant to the security or not, would violate an existing state or federal law if applied in this state, shall not as a matter of law sustain the burden of proof that the seller did not know, and in the exercise of reasonable care, could not have known of the untruth or omission of material fact if the seller knew that the security or its underlying asset or collateral was subject to foreign law as defined in \u00a7 47-31B-501; it is no defense to liability under subsection (b) that the seller did not know that the foreign law did not violate an existing state or federal law. (2) The purchaser may maintain an action to recover the consideration paid for the security, less the amount of any income received on the security, and interest at Category D, \u00a7 54-3-16 from the date of the purchase, costs, and reasonable attorneys' fees determined by the court, upon the tender of the security, or for actual damages as provided in paragraph (3) (4). (2)(3) The tender referred to in paragraph (1) (2) may be made any time before entry of judgment. Tender requires only notice in a record of ownership of the security and willingness to exchange the security for the amount specified. A purchaser that no longer owns the security may recover actual damages as provided in paragraph (3) (4). (3)(4) Actual damages in an action arising under this subsection are the amount that would be recoverable upon a tender less the value of the security when the purchaser disposed of it, and interest at Category D \u00a7 54-3-16 from the date of the purchase, costs, and reasonable attorneys' fees determined by the court. (c) Liability of purchaser to seller. A person is liable to the seller if the person buys a security by means of an untrue statement of a material fact or omission to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statement made, in light of the circumstances under which it is made, not misleading, the seller not knowing of the untruth or omission, and the purchaser not sustaining the burden of proof that the purchaser did not know, and in the exercise of reasonable care, could not have known of the untruth or omission. An action under this subsection is governed by the following: (1) The seller may maintain an action to recover the security, and any income received on the security, costs, and reasonable attorneys' fees determined by the court, upon the tender of the purchase price, or for actual damages as provided in paragraph (3). (2) The tender referred to in paragraph (1) may be made any time before entry of judgment. Tender requires only notice in a record of the present ability to pay the amount tendered and willingness to take delivery of the security for the amount specified. If the purchaser no longer owns the security, the seller may recover actual damages as provided in paragraph (3). (3) Actual damages in an action arising under this subsection are the difference between the price at which the security was sold and the value the security would have had at the time of the sale in the absence of the purchaser's conduct causing liability, and interest at Category D \u00a7 54-3-16 from the date of the sale of the security, costs, and reasonable attorneys' fees determined by the court.

The client may maintain an action to recover the consideration paid for the advice, interest at Category D \u00a7 54-3-16 from the date of payment, costs, and reasonable attorneys' fees determined by the court. (f) Liability for investment advice. A person that receives directly or indirectly any consideration for providing investment advice to another person and that employs a device, scheme, or artifice to defraud the other person or engages in an act, practice, or course of business that operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit on the other person, is liable to the other person. An action under this subsection is governed by the following: (1) The person defrauded may maintain an action to recover the consideration paid for the advice and the amount of any actual damages caused by the fraudulent conduct, interest at Category D \u00a7 54-3-16 from the date of the fraudulent conduct, costs, and reasonable attorneys' fees determined by the court, less the amount of any income received as a result of the fraudulent conduct. (2) This subsection does not apply to a broker-dealer or its agents if the investment advice provided is solely incidental to transacting business as a broker-dealer and no special compensation is received for the investment advice. (g) Joint and several liability. The following persons are liable jointly and severally with and to the same extent as persons liable under subsections (b) through (f): (1) A person that directly or indirectly controls a person liable under subsections (b) through (f), unless the controlling person sustains the burden of proof that the person did not know, and in the exercise of reasonable care could not have known, of the existence of conduct by reason of which the liability is alleged to exist; (2) An individual A person who is a managing partner, executive officer, or director of a person liable under subsections (b) through (f), including an individual a person having a similar status or performing similar functions, unless the individual person sustains the burden of proof that the individual person did not know and, in the exercise of reasonable care could not have known, of the existence of conduct by reason of which the liability is alleged to exist; (3) An individual A person who is an employee of or associated with a person liable under subsections (b) through (f), including a professional retained for specific purposes, and who materially aids the conduct giving rise to the liability, unless the individual person sustains the burden of proof that the individual person did not know and, in the exercise of reasonable care could not have known, of the existence of conduct by reason of which the liability is alleged to exist; and (4) A person liable under subsections (1) through (2) whose liability arises out of a sale of a security where the security, or its underlying asset or collateral, when offered, sold, or purchased in this state, was subject to, bound by, or otherwise controlled by a foreign law, in which any part of that foreign law, relevant to the security or not, would violate an existing state or federal law if applied in this state, will be liable under subsections (1) and (2) unless the person can sustain the burden of proof that the person did not know and, in the exercise of reasonable care, could not have known, that the seller was not going to disclose to the purchaser the requisite disclosures of material fact as required by \u00a7 47-31B-501; and (5) A person that is a broker-dealer, agent, investment adviser, or investment adviser representative that materially aids the conduct giving rise to the liability under subsections (b) through (f), unless the person sustains the burden of proof that the person did not know and, in the exercise of reasonable care could not have known, of the existence of conduct by reason of which liability is alleged to exist.
