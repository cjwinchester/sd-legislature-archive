BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 25-5-35 be amended to read: 25-5-35. A mother may breastfeed her child in a discreet or modest manner in any location, public or private, where the mother and child are otherwise authorized to be present as long as the mother is in compliance with all other state and municipal laws. However, no No municipality may outright ban breastfeeding in public places. A person may not restrict or limit the right of a mother to breastfeed her child. Section 2. That \u00a7 22-24-1.2 be amended to read: 22-24-1.2. A person commits the crime of indecent exposure if, with the intent to arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person, the person exposes his or her genitals in a public place, or in the view of a public place, under circumstances in which that person knows that person's conduct is likely to annoy, offend, or alarm another person. A violation of this section is a Class 1 misdemeanor. However, if such the person has been previously convicted of a felony violation of \u00a7 22-22-1, 22-22-7, or 22-24A-3, that person is guilty of a Class 6 felony. Any person convicted of a third or subsequent violation of this section is guilty of a Class 6 felony.
