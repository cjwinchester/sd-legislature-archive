BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 13-28-11 be amended to read as follows: 13-28-11. If a child is residing in a residential treatment center or an intensive residential treatment center which provides care for children who are not living with their parents or guardian, the school residence of the child is the school district where the parents or guardian reside, subject to the provisions of \u00a7 13-28-9. The school district where a residential treatment center or intensive residential treatment center is located is responsible for providing an educational program for the children who reside in the residential treatment center or intensive residential treatment center. Tuition for a child enrolled in a public school district is the responsibility of the school district where the child was enrolled at the time of placement in the residential treatment center or intensive residential treatment center. The amount of tuition paid by the resident that school district for any child placed in a residential treatment center or intensive residential treatment center who is not eligible for special education services at the time of placement shall be calculated as follows: (1) Divide the current per student allocation as defined in subdivision 13-13-10.1(4) by one hundred seventy-five; and (2) Multiply the result obtained in subdivision (1) by the number of days the child is placed. This section applies only to a residential treatment center or intensive residential treatment center that provided an educational program through a school district in the 2013-2014 school year or that initiates an educational program through a school district in a subsequent school year. This section does not apply to any placement by the Unified Judicial System, the Department of Corrections, the Department of Social Services, or any entity approved by the Department of Social Services, including a foster home. Section 2. That \u00a7 13-13-87 be amended to read as follows: 13-13-87. A school district providing education for children in a residential treatment center or intensive residential treatment center shall receive an amount equal to the current year's per student allocation as defined in subdivision 13-13-10.1(4) multiplied by the average daily membership, in the prior school year, for residentially-placed students attending each residential treatment center or intensive residential treatment center for whom tuition is paid by another school district pursuant to \u00a7 13-28-11.
