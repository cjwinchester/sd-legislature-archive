WHEREAS, the Keystone One Pipeline carries 550,000 barrels per day of tar sands oil (also known as dilbit) and if completed the Keystone XL Pipeline will potentially carry 830,000 barrels per day of tar sands oil across the state of South Dakota; and WHEREAS, in 1990, after the Exxon Valdez Oil Spill, it became clear that in order to protect our country's environment, the issue of oil spill cleanups and procedures needed to be addressed. The federal oil spill liability trust fund was established with the purpose of providing the funding for this protection; and WHEREAS, the Internal Revenue Service ruled that tar sands oil imported into the United States is exempt from the federal oil spill liability trust fund tax because it is synthetic petroleum and not oil; and WHEREAS, in 2015 the National Academies of Sciences determined that American oil spill procedures are inadequate to deal with tar sands and dilbit oil spills; and WHEREAS, critics assert that pipelines carrying tar sands oil pose a special risk, compared to other crude oils, because the tar sands oil operates at a higher temperature which has been linked to increased corrosion; and WHEREAS, these pipelines have to flow at higher pressures (1440psi) which increase the risk of ruptures. The Natural Resources Defense Council notes that pipelines in the upper Midwest that routinely carry oil from tar sands have spilled 3.6 times more oil per pipeline mile than the United States average; and WHEREAS, the owners of the Keystone One Pipeline and the potential Keystone XL Pipeline have given their word that they will pay for any tar sands oil cleanup required from a spill; however, there is no bond requirement to provide such assurance; and WHEREAS, the United States Senate passed a Sense of the Senate resolution that stated the eight cents per barrel federal oil spill liability trust fund tax should be paid by pipelines carrying dilbit oil; and WHEREAS, it is especially concerning to the residents of South Dakota that the potentially hazardous dilbit oil is pumped across our state with no assurances as to who will pay for any potential cleanups that may be necessary: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the Senate of the Ninety-Second Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the House of Representatives concurring therein, that Congress be hereby requested to preserve and protect our land by requiring the federal government to recognize dilbit as oil and require payment into the federal oil spill liability trust fund for the Keystone One Pipeline and the Keystone XL Pipeline, and that copies of this resolution be forwarded to the South Dakota congressional delegation and to the President of the United States."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 8289, "action_date": "2017-02-23T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 44901, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/44901.pdf", "status_text": "First read and referred to", "journal_page": 518, "committee_id_action": 360, "committee_id_assigned": 340, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 8289, "action_date": "2017-02-27T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 44925, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/44925.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 340, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 8289, "action_date": "2017-02-27T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 45045, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/45045.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 340, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "F", "vote": {"vote_id": 23760, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [1154, 1131, 1144, 1108], "Excused": [1148, 1169], "Yea": [1105, 1107, 1102]}}, {"bill_id": 8289, "action_date": "2017-02-27T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 45045, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/45045.pdf", "status_text": "Tabled", "journal_page": 569, "committee_id_action": 340, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 23759, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [1154, 1107, 1131, 1144, 1108], "Excused": [1148, 1169], "Nay": [1105, 1102]}}]}
