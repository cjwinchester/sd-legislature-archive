No state agency or state official may contract or enter into any agreement for the construction of a building on state owned land without prior Legislative approval through an act of the Legislature. However, provisions of this Act do not apply to the reconstruction of a building that has been destroyed or substantially damaged, if the cost of the reconstruction does not exceed fifty thousand dollars. Section 2. The General Appropriations Act shall contain a separate object of appropriation called \"Building Lease Payments.\" Money appropriated as \"Building Lease Payments\" shall be used exclusively for the payment for the use of space within a building under the terms of a lease. Any money appropriated as \"Building Lease Payments\" that is not used to make payments under the terms of a lease shall revert to the fund from which the money was appropriated. Money appropriated for a purpose other than lease payments may not be transferred to the \"Building Lease Payments\" object of appropriation or otherwise used to make payments under the terms of a lease."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 12520, "action_date": "1997-01-30T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 72890, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/72890.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 219, "committee_id_action": 544, "committee_id_assigned": 539, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 12520, "action_date": "1997-02-12T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 72343, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/72343.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 539, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 12520, "action_date": "1997-02-12T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 72343, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/72343.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass,", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 539, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "F", "vote": {"vote_id": 36440, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [1890, 1926, 1940, 1970], "Nay": [1900, 1904, 1924, 1931, 1967, 1961, 1921], "Excused": [1936, 1949]}}, {"bill_id": 12520, "action_date": "1997-02-12T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 72343, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/72343.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass,", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 539, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "F", "vote": {"vote_id": 36440, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [1890, 1926, 1940, 1970], "Nay": [1900, 1904, 1924, 1931, 1967, 1961, 1921], "Excused": [1936, 1949]}}, {"bill_id": 12520, "action_date": "1997-02-12T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 72343, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/72343.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to 41st legislative day", "journal_page": 436, "committee_id_action": 539, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 36343, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [1890, 1926, 1940, 1970], "Yea": [1900, 1904, 1924, 1931, 1967, 1961, 1921], "Excused": [1936, 1949]}}]}
