BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 62-1-1.3 be amended to read as follows: 62-1-1.3. If an employer denies coverage of a claim on the basis that the injury is not compensable under this title due to the provisions of subsection 62-1-1(7)(a), (b), or (c), such injury is presumed to be nonwork related for other insurance purposes, and any other insurer covering bodily injury or disease of the injured employee shall pay according to the policy provisions. If coverage is denied by an insurer without a full explanation of the basis in the insurance policy in relation to the facts or applicable law for denial, the director of the Division of Insurance may determine such the denial to be an unfair practice under chapter 58-33. If it is later determined that the injury is compensable under this title, the employer shall immediately reimburse the parties not liable for all payments made, including interest at the category B rate specified in \u00a7 54-3-16 , as follows: (1) If medical expenses have been denied by the employer, paid by a health plan, insurer, or an individual, and the expenses are later determined to be compensable, the employer shall satisfy the employer's obligation of payment of the medical expenses by paying the expenses directly to the health plan, insurer, or individual to the extent of the health plan's, insurer's or individual's payment, but not to exceed the amount payable under the medical fee schedule or any other contractual discount arrangements. A medical provider shall reimburse the employee for medical expense payments received from the employee for expenses determined to be compensable under this title; (2) If the medical expenses were not paid by a health plan, insurer, or individual, the employer shall satisfy the employer's obligation of payment of the medical expenses by paying the expenses directly to the medical providers concerned under the medical fee schedule or any other contractual discount arrangements; and (3) If disability benefits have been paid by a health insurer and benefits are later determined to be compensable, the employer shall satisfy the employer's obligation by paying the health insurer directly, to the extent of that health insurer's disability payments, but not to exceed the amount of disability benefits payable under this chapter. Any payments made to the health insurer pursuant to this subdivision shall be considered as an offset against the total obligation of the employer ."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 4857, "action_date": "2008-01-08T12:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 563, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/563.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 20, "committee_id_action": 27, "committee_id_assigned": 15, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 4857, "action_date": "2008-01-14T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 692, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/692.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 15, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 4857, "action_date": "2008-01-14T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 891, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/891.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass", "journal_page": 116, "committee_id_action": 15, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 126, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [602, 555, 546, 578, 540], "Yea": [579, 623, 556, 589, 536, 617, 561, 600]}}, {"bill_id": 4857, "action_date": "2008-01-15T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 1045, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/1045.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass", "journal_page": 139, "committee_id_action": 27, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "F", "vote": {"vote_id": 214, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [602, 609, 593, 586, 570, 532, 574, 534, 555, 542, 568, 552, 575, 572, 624, 529, 594, 631, 620, 616, 633, 605, 628, 630, 571, 581, 544, 546, 578, 599, 554, 547, 538, 603, 615, 531, 540, 566, 619, 611, 587], "Yea": [579, 614, 625, 597, 608, 623, 580, 595, 565, 556, 585, 589, 543, 558, 537, 536, 612, 551, 617, 583, 600, 563, 549, 626, 606, 559, 564, 561, 591]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/4857"}
