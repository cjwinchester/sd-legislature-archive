BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. Each institution of higher learning under the control of the Board of Regents shall make available to any student enrolled at the institution an optional prepaid debit meal plan. The debit meal plan shall use a declining balance system and an electronic debit card or similar instrument as a means of payment for meals or food and beverage items provided at facilities that are operated by or are affiliated with the institution. Any student who uses the debit meal plan provided for in this section shall deposit an amount of money determined by the student into the student's debit meal plan account to be used for the purchase of meals or food and beverage items. Under the debit meal plan, no student may be required to deposit more than two hundred fifty dollars for meals or food and beverage items during any semester. Any student using the debit meal plan may place additional money into the student's debit meal plan account at any time during the semester or academic term. The debit card and account system established for use with the debit meal plan may be combined with payment systems offered by the institution for other goods and services used by the student. Any money remaining in the student's debit meal plan account at the end of the semester or academic term shall be credited to the student's account for use during the following semester or academic term, unless the student is no longer enrolled at the institution, in which case the student's remaining balance is forfeited."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 799, "action_date": "2009-01-28T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 6150, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/6150.pdf", "status_text": "First read in Senate and referred to", "journal_page": 204, "committee_id_action": 54, "committee_id_assigned": 32, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 799, "action_date": "2009-02-03T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 6301, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/6301.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 32, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 799, "action_date": "2009-02-05T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 6750, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/6750.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 32, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 799, "action_date": "2009-02-05T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 6884, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/6884.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to the 41st legislative day", "journal_page": 316, "committee_id_action": 32, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 3661, "president_vote": null, "Excused": [677, 661], "Yea": [656, 664, 648, 640, 673]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/799"}
