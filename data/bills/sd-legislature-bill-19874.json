No person shall intentionally may abandon a motor vehicle on any public highway or right-of-way. A violation of this section is a Class 1 misdemeanor. Any person convicted of abandoning a motor vehicle shall be ordered to pay a fine of five hundred dollars. The court shall suspend the fine if the person pays for the towing and storage expenses. Section 2. That \u00a7 32-30-15 be amended to read as follows: 32-30-15. Any removal agency as defined by \u00a7 32-36-2 which has removed an abandoned or wrecked vehicle pursuant to this chapter or a vehicle impounded pursuant to \u00a7 32-30-19 shall comply with the provisions of \u00a7 32-36-8 to notify the registered owner, and if encumbered, the lien holder of the vehicle. If no person claims the vehicle within fifteen days of that notice if the vehicle is six years old or older or within thirty days of that notice if the vehicle is less than six years old , the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 32-36-9 and 32-36-11 shall apply to the disposal of the vehicle. Section 3. That \u00a7 32-30-18.1 be amended to read as follows: 32-30-18.1. Any owner of a motor vehicle who intentionally abandons a motor vehicle on any public highway or right-of-way is civilly liable to the towing company for the expense of towing the motor vehicle. The owner is also civilly liable for any storage expense pursuant to \u00a7 32-36-8. Section 4. That \u00a7 32-36-8 be amended to read as follows: 32-36-8. Within forty-five days after any abandoned or junk motor vehicle, any wrecked vehicle as provided by \u00a7 32-30-14, or any impounded vehicle, or other scrap metal has been removed, the removal agency shall send written notice by certified mail to the registered owner, if any, of the abandoned or junk motor vehicle, wrecked vehicle, or scrap metal and to all readily identifiable lien holders of record at their last known address. If the removal agency does not give notice within ten days from the date of removal, no storage may be charged beyond the ten-day period until the notice is mailed. The notice shall set forth the date and place of the taking, the year, the make, model and serial number of the abandoned or wrecked motor vehicle and the place where the vehicle is being held, and shall inform the owner and any lien holders of their right to reclaim the vehicle under \u00a7 32-36-9. The notice shall be on a form provided by the Department of Revenue and Regulation . If it is impossible to determine with reasonable certainty the identity and address of the registered owner and all lienholders, the notice shall be published once in a newspaper of general circulation in the area where the motor vehicle was abandoned or wrecked . Published notices may be grouped together for convenience and economy. A violation of this section is a Class 2 misdemeanor. Section 5. That \u00a7 32-36-9 be amended to read as follows: 32-36-9. Notwithstanding any statutes to the contrary, title to any abandoned or junk motor vehicle, any impounded vehicle, or other scrap metal shall vest in the removal agency after a period of fifteen days for any vehicle six years old or more or after a period of thirty days for any vehicle less than six years old, from the date on which notice was sent under \u00a7 32-36-8. The record holder of title or the lienholder may reclaim the motor vehicle or other scrap metal. The lienholder and record holder of title shall notify the department in writing within thirty days of their intent to reclaim the motor vehicle. However, if the record holder of title fails to claim and remove the motor vehicle or other scrap metal within thirty days after mailing of notice, title to the vehicle is irrevocably vested in the removal agency."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 19874, "action_date": "2005-01-31T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 103721, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/103721.pdf", "status_text": "First read in Senate and referred to", "journal_page": 245, "committee_id_action": 861, "committee_id_assigned": 845, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 19874, "action_date": "2005-02-08T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 104288, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/104288.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 845, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 19874, "action_date": "2005-02-08T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 104288, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/104288.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to another day", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 845, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 19874, "action_date": "2005-02-08T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 104288, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/104288.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to another day", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 845, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 19874, "action_date": "2005-02-15T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 104730, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/104730.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 845, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 19874, "action_date": "2005-02-15T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 104730, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/104730.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to 41st legislative day", "journal_page": 482, "committee_id_action": 845, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 60076, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [3193, 3200], "Yea": [3210, 3212, 3214, 3157, 3198]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/19874"}
