WHEREAS, South Dakota has made great strides in developing a biofuels industry, including production of corn ethanol and biodiesel; and WHEREAS, it will soon be possible to produce cellulosic ethanol from biomass materials such as corn stover, wheat straw, switchgrass, forest residues, mill residues, and urban wood waste; and WHEREAS, other materials such as manure and methane from landfills and wastewater treatment also have value as raw materials for producing energy and products; and WHEREAS, in addition to cellulosic ethanol, other technologies under development could transform biomass materials into natural gas substitutes, other liquid transportation fuels, and electricity; and WHEREAS, South Dakota has a vast supply of biomass materials, including all of those mentioned above; and WHEREAS, South Dakota State University is one of five regional centers for the Sun Grant Initiative, a national network of land-grant universities and United States Department of Energy laboratories charged with making significant advances in biobased industries for the benefit of America's independent farmers, rural communities, and the public at large; and WHEREAS, South Dakota has much to gain from an expanded bioeconomy, including greater independence from imported energy, a revitalized rural economy, more manufacturing jobs, and a cleaner environment: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the Senate of the Eighty-second Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the House of Representatives concurring therein, that South Dakota will seek to have demonstrations of key biomass technologies by 2015, including biomass gasification to provide heat for a conventional corn ethanol or biodiesel plant, cellulosic ethanol, pyrolysis, biomass integrated gasification combined cycle, and biomass combined heat and power. South Dakota will take steps to ensure that demonstration projects can be developed by creating a package of appropriate incentives to reduce investor risk in innovative projects; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that South Dakota will set numeric targets with timelines in order to increase the economic utilization of its biomass resource; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that South Dakota will invest in the development of perennial biomass crops, including switchgrass and other native grasses by supporting long-term research and development of crops and cropping systems; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that South Dakota's government agencies will provide an early market by preferentially purchasing bio-based products if they are cost-competitive with their fossil-based equivalent, if they perform as well as their fossil-based equivalent, and if they are readily available; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that South Dakota will take steps to ensure that South Dakotans have an opportunity to purchase biofuels and bioproducts and that there is an adequate market within the state to support an industry by promoting the development of highly efficient biofuel powered vehicles, expanding government purchasing of biofuels and biofuel powered vehicles, considering retail tax incentives for the purchase of biofuels, and creating incentives for stations offering high blends of biofuels such as E85 and B20, and for dialable pumps; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that South Dakota will provide technical assistance to the growing bioeconomy through funding for front end engineering and design (FEED) studies for advanced biomass projects and through an expansion of technical assistance capabilities and funding in the following areas: cooperative development, South Dakota Department of Agriculture, the state energy office, university resources, state agricultural extension, and resource conservation and development organizations; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that South Dakota will provide dedicated funding to demonstration projects that seek to develop a sustainable biomass supply, including funding and assistance to local governments and communities that seek to complete biomass resource assessments."}, {"bill_id": 21707, "bill_version_id": 113018, "bill_version": "Enrolled", "bill_version_date": "2007-02-28T09:34:43-06:00", "bill_text": ""}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 21707, "action_date": "2007-02-22T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 112664, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/112664.pdf", "status_text": "Introduced", "journal_page": 615, "committee_id_action": 924, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 21707, "action_date": "2007-02-23T12:30:00-06:00", "document_id": 112778, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/112778.pdf", "status_text": "Adopt Resolution", "journal_page": 638, "committee_id_action": 924, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 65585, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [3571, 3573, 3574, 3575, 3585, 3589, 3595, 3596, 3602, 3607, 3608, 3610, 3612, 3615, 3617, 3618, 3621, 3623, 3625, 3626, 3627, 3630, 3633, 3634, 3636, 3639, 3641, 3647, 3652, 3659, 3661, 3664, 3667, 3669], "Excused": [3603]}}, {"bill_id": 21707, "action_date": "2007-02-26T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 112871, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/112871.pdf", "status_text": "Introduced", "journal_page": 647, "committee_id_action": 923, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 21707, "action_date": "2007-02-27T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 112981, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/112981.pdf", "status_text": "Concur In resolution", "journal_page": 674, "committee_id_action": 923, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 67224, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [3572, 3576, 3577, 3578, 3580, 3581, 3582, 3583, 3586, 3588, 3590, 3591, 3592, 3593, 3594, 3597, 3598, 3599, 3600, 3604, 3605, 3606, 3609, 3611, 3613, 3614, 3616, 3619, 3620, 3622, 3624, 3629, 3631, 3632, 3635, 3637, 3638, 3640, 3643, 3644, 3645, 3646, 3648, 3649, 3650, 3651, 3653, 3654, 3655, 3656, 3657, 3658, 3660, 3662, 3663, 3665, 3666, 3668, 3670, 3671, 3672, 3673, 3674, 3675, 3676, 3584], "Nay": [3579, 3587, 3628, 3642]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/21707"}
