Section 3. The youth offender ombudsman may: (1) Investigate, on complaint or on the youth offender ombudsman's own motion, any action by any juvenile correctional facilities operated by the Department of Corrections without regard to its finality; (2) Examine by subpoena the records and documents of the Department of Corrections; (3) Enter and inspect without notice any youth correction facility; (4) Subpoena any person to appear, to give sworn testimony, or to produce documentary or other evidence that is reasonably material to an inquiry; (5) Undertake, participate in, or cooperate with persons and agencies in such conferences, inquiries, meetings, or studies as might lead to improvements in the functioning of the Department of Corrections; (6) Bring suit in the circuit court for Hughes County to enforce this Act; and (7) Establish and administer a budget for the office.

Section 5. Notwithstanding section 5 of this Act, the youth offender ombudsman may decide not to investigate because: (1) The complainant could reasonably be expected to use a different administrative remedy or action; (2) The complaint is trivial, frivolous, vexatious, or not made in good faith; or (3) The complaint has been too long delayed to justify present examination. Section 6. The youth offender ombudsman shall: (1) Give priority to investigating administrative actions that are not otherwise reviewable by either administrative or judicial action; (2) Treat confidentially all matters and the identities of the complainants or witnesses coming before the ombudsman; (3) Not levy any fees for the submission or investigation of complaints; and (4) At least annually prepare and submit a report to the Legislature and Governor regarding the conditions at juvenile correction facilities.

If the ombudsman so requests, the Department of Corrections shall, within the time specified, inform the ombudsman about the action taken on the recommendations or the reasons for not complying with them. After a reasonable period of time has elapsed, the ombudsman may issue a report. Section 8.

The ombudsman may not be compelled to testify or produce evidence in any judicial or administrative proceeding with respect to any matter involving the exercise of the ombudsman official duties except as may be necessary to enforce this Act. Except as otherwise provided, if the ombudsman has knowledge of confidential information relating to a child involved or allegedly involved in child sexual abuse, the information remains confidential and is not subject to public disclosure. Section 12. If any person willfully obstructs or hinders the proper and lawful exercise of the youth offender ombudsman's powers or willfully misleads or attempts to mislead the ombudsman in inquiries under this Act, the judge of the circuit court for Hughes County, on application of the ombudsman, shall compel obedience by proceedings for contempt as in the case of disobedience of the requirements of a subpoena issued from such court or a refusal to testify therein."}, {"bill_id": 16462, "bill_version_id": 89522, "bill_version": "Senate Judiciary Engrossed", "bill_version_date": "2001-02-07T15:21:21-06:00", "bill_text": "FOR AN ACT ENTITLED, An Act to establish an ombudsman to represent youth offenders.
