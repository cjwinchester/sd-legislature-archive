BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. The Legislature finds the following: (1) Cigarette smoking presents serious public health concerns to the State of South Dakota and to the citizens of the state. The surgeon general of the United States has determined that smoking causes lung cancer, heart disease, and other serious diseases, and that there are hundreds of thousands of tobacco-related deaths in the United States each year. These diseases most often do not appear until many years after the person in question begins smoking; (2) Cigarette smoking also presents serious financial concerns for the state. Under certain health care programs, the state may have a legal obligation to provide medical assistance to eligible persons for health conditions associated with cigarette smoking, and those persons may have a legal entitlement to receive such medical assistance; (3) Under these programs, the state pays millions of dollars each year to provide medical assistance for these persons for health conditions associated with cigarette smoking; and (4) On November 23, 1998, major United States tobacco product manufacturers entered into a settlement agreement, entitled, Master Settlement Agreement, with the state. The Master Settlement Agreement obligates these manufacturers, in return for a release of past, present, and certain future claims against them as described therein, to pay substantial sums to the state, tied in part to their volume of sales; to fund a national foundation devoted to the interests of public health; and to make substantial changes in their advertising and marketing practices and corporate culture, with the intention of reducing underage smoking. Section 2. In enacting this Act, it is the intention of the Legislature that: (1) It is the policy of the state that financial burdens imposed on the state by cigarette smoking be borne by tobacco product manufacturers rather than by the State of South Dakota to the extent that such manufacturers either determine to enter into a settlement with the state or are found culpable by the courts; and (2) It would be contrary to this policy of the State of South Dakota if tobacco product manufacturers who determine not to enter into such a settlement could use a resulting cost advantage to derive large, short-term profits in the years before liability may arise without ensuring that the state will have an eventual source of recovery from them if they are proven to have acted culpably. It is thus in the interest of the state to require that such manufacturers establish a reserve fund to guarantee a source of compensation and to prevent such manufacturers from deriving large, short-term profits and then becoming judgment-proof before liability may arise. Section 3. Terms used in this Act mean: (1) \"Adjusted for inflation,\" increased in accordance with the formula for inflation adjustment set forth in the Master Settlement Agreement; (2) \"Affiliate,\" a person who directly or indirectly owns or controls, is owned or controlled by, or is under common ownership or control with, another person. Solely for purposes of this definition, the terms, owns, is owned, and ownership, mean ownership of an equity interest, or the equivalent thereof, of ten percent or more, and the term, person, means an individual, partnership, committee, association, corporation, or any other organization or group of persons; (3) \"Allocable share,\" allocable share as that term is defined in the Master Settlement Agreement; (4) \"Master Settlement Agreement,\" the settlement agreement, and related documents, entered into on November 23, 1998, by the State of South Dakota and major United States tobacco product manufacturers which is filed as part of the court record in State of South Dakota, et al. v. Philip Morris, Inc., et al., Civ. No. 98-65, Sixth Judicial Circuit, Hughes County; (5) \"Qualified escrow fund,\" an escrow arrangement with a federally or state-chartered financial institution having no affiliation with any tobacco product manufacturer and having assets of at least one billion dollars where such arrangement requires that the financial institution hold the escrowed funds' principal for the benefit of releasing parties and prohibits the tobacco product manufacturer placing the funds into escrow from using, accessing, or directing the use of the funds' principal except as consistent with section 8 of this Act; (6) \"Released claims,\" released claims as that term is defined in the Master Settlement Agreement; (7) \"Releasing parties,\" releasing parties as that term is defined in the Master Settlement Agreement. Section 4.

The term, cigarette, includes, roll-your-own, meaning any tobacco which, because of its appearance, type, packaging, or labeling is suitable for use and likely to be offered to, or purchased by, consumers as tobacco for making cigarettes.
