BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. The Department of Game, Fish, and Parks shall establish a program to act as an information clearing house to facilitate contact between landowners who are interested in having coyotes harvested from their property and sportsmen who are interested in hunting coyotes on private land. Landowners may provide the department with all relevant information concerning times, seasons, areas, methods of hunting, and any other restrictions or limitations that they may wish to establish in return for providing hunting access. Sportsmen may provide the department with all relevant information concerning availability, willingness, skill, or any other factor that they may feel is pertinent to the landowner in selecting sportsmen to grant access to the landowner's property. The department shall provide this service without cost to the landowners or the sportsmen. Section 2. Nothing in this Act prohibits any landowner or group of landowners from paying a bounty for coyotes killed on their own property. 750 copies of this document were printed by the South Dakota Legislative Research Council at a cost of $.016 per page. .
