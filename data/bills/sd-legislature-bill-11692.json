In determining restrictions, the secretary shall, pursuant to \u00a7 38-21-39, consider the characteristics of the pesticide formulation such as the acute dermal inhalation toxicity; the persistence, mobility, and susceptibility to biological concentration; the use experience which may reflect an inherent misuse of an unexpected good safety record which does not always follow laboratory toxicological information; the relative hazards of patterns of use such as granular soil applications, ultra\u2011low volume or dust aerial applications, or air blast sprayer applications; and the extent of the intended use.

If, in the opinion of the secretary, it appears that this chapter has been violated by the person, the secretary shall refer the facts to the state's attorney for the county in which the violation occurred with a copy of the results of the analysis, the examination of the pesticide or device or any other relevant evidence, and information in the possession of the secretary.

Section 17. That \u00a7 38-21-45 be AMENDED: 38-21-45. Pesticide damage--Liability.
