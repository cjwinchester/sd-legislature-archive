BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 26-8A-11 be amended to read as follows: 26-8A-11. Within thirty days after notice of a substantiated investigation by the Department of Social Services, a subject of a report of abuse or neglect may request the department to amend, expunge identifying information from, or remove the record of the report from the register. The request shall be in writing and directed to the person designated by the department in the notice. If the department refuses to do so or does not act within thirty days after receipt of the written request, the subject may request an administrative hearing within thirty days to determine whether the record of the report should be amended, expunged, or removed on the grounds that it is inaccurate or it is being maintained in a manner inconsistent with this chapter. However, if there has been a court finding of child abuse or neglect, the report's accuracy is conclusively presumed and the subject has no right to an administrative hearing on the ground of inaccuracy. The hearing shall be held within a reasonable time after the subject's request and at a reasonable place and hour. The appropriate local office of the Department of Social Services shall be given notice of the hearing. In the hearing, the burden of proving the accuracy and consistency of the record is on the department. The hearing examiner may order the amendment, expunction, or removal of the record to make it accurate and consistent with this chapter. However, under no circumstances, may the hearing examiner order or may the department carry out any amendment, expunction, or removal of any portion of the record that proves, affirms, corroborates, or supports the innocence of the subject of the report without the express written authority of the subject. The decision the Department of Social Services notifies any person that he or she will be placed on the central registry for child abuse and neglect based upon a substantiated investigation, the person may request an administrative hearing. The administrative hearing is limited to determining whether the record should be amended or removed on the grounds that it is inaccurate. The request shall be made in writing and directed to the person designated by the department in the notice. However, if there has been a court finding of child abuse or neglect, the record's accuracy is conclusively presumed and the person has no right to an administrative hearing. In the hearing, the burden of proving the accuracy of the record is on the department. The hearing examiner may order the amendment or removal of the record. The decision of the hearing examiner shall be made in writing within ninety days after the date of receipt of the request for a hearing and shall state the reasons upon which it is based. Decisions of the department under this section are administrative decisions subject to judicial review under chapter 1-26. In any case where there has been no substantiated report of child abuse and neglect, the department may not maintain a record or other information of unsubstantiated child abuse and neglect for longer than three years if there has been no further report within that three-year period."}, {"bill_id": 21447, "bill_version_id": 112435, "bill_version": "Enrolled", "bill_version_date":
