If the identity or location of the parent or Indian custodian and the Indian child's tribe cannot be determined, the notice shall be given to the United States Secretary of the Interior and to the area director for the Bureau of Indian Affairs in like manner, who have fifteen days after receipt to provide the requisite notice to the parent or Indian custodian and the tribe; (2) The state's attorney shall provide such notice prior to any adjudicatory hearing and prior to any final dispositional hearing in which the state seeks termination of parental rights of one or both parents or termination of the rights of the Indian custodian.

No foster care placement or termination of parental rights proceedings may be held until at least ten days after receipt of the foregoing notice by the parent or Indian custodian and the tribe or the Secretary. The parent or Indian custodian or the tribe shall, upon request, be granted up to twenty additional days to prepare for the proceeding; (4) The notice required in this section shall be written in clear and understandable language and shall include the following: (a) The name and tribal affiliation, if known, of the Indian child; (b) A copy of the petition unless the notice is served by publication pursuant to 26-7A-48; (c) The name and address of the state's attorney; (d) A statement listing the rights of the Indian child's parents, Indian custodians, and tribes, under the Indian Child Welfare Act, 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 1901, et. seq., as amended to January 1, 2005, including: (i) The right of a Indian custodian or the Indian child's tribe to intervene in a proceeding for the foster care placement of, or termination of parental rights to, the Indian child; (ii) The right to file a motion to transfer the proceeding to the tribal court of the Indian child's tribe; (iii) The right to be granted up to twenty days from the receipt of the notice to prepare for the proceeding; and (iv) The right to request that the court grant further extensions of time; (e) If the petition alleges the child to be an abused or neglected child, a statement that the termination of parental or custodial rights is a possible remedy under the proceedings; (f) A statement that if the Indian child's parents or Indian custodian are unable to afford counsel, counsel may be appointed to represent them; (g) A statement in the notice to the tribe that the information contained in the notice, petition, pleading, or other documents are confidential; and (h) The location, mailing address and telephone number of the court.

However, at the request of any party or if required by the court, the court shall set a later time and date for the dispositional hearing. The court shall then determine interim dispositional arrangements concerning the child and the parties. If the petition is not admitted by all necessary parties, including the child, if appropriate, or if the petition is denied by any necessary party or the child, if appropriate, the court shall proceed with the adjudicatory hearing on the petition , if notice has been given as required by section 2 of this Act, if applicable, or schedule the adjudicatory hearing for a later time and date. If the advisory hearing is adjourned and continued or if the advisory hearing is completed and the adjudicatory hearing on the petition is scheduled for a later time and date, the court shall make an interim order regarding temporary custody of the child as determined by the court.
