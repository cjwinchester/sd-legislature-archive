A court which may suspend sentence under \u00a7 23A-27-18 retains jurisdiction for the purpose of suspending any such sentence for a period of one year two years from the effective date of the judgment of conviction, notwithstanding the fact that the time for an appeal from such judgment is limited to a shorter period of time.

Such notice shall be provided any victim by such attorney pursuant to the provisions of \u00a7 23A-27-1.2. Any person whose sentence is suspended pursuant to this section is under the supervision of the Board of Pardons and Paroles, except as provided in \u00a7 23A-27-18.2. The board is charged with the responsibility for enforcing the conditions imposed by the sentencing judge , and the board retains jurisdiction to revoke the suspended portion of the sentence for violation of the terms of the suspension. Section 2. That \u00a7 23A-31-1 be amended to read as follows: 23A-31-1. A court may correct an illegal sentence at any time and may correct a sentence imposed in an illegal manner within the time provided in this section for the reduction of sentence. A court may reduce a sentence: (1) Within one year two years after the sentence is imposed; (2) Within one hundred twenty days after receipt by the court of a remittitur issued upon affirmance of the judgment or dismissal of the appeal; or (3) Within one hundred twenty days after entry of any order or judgment of the Supreme Court denying review of, or having the effect of upholding, a judgment of conviction; whichever is later. A court may also reduce a sentence upon revocation of probation or suspension of sentence as provided by law.
