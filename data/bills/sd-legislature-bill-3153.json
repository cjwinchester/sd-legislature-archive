Service of process is perfected on a foreign limited partnership that has filed a cancellation in the manner outlined in \u00a7\u00a7 59-11-16 to 59-11-19, inclusive. Section 24. That \u00a7 48-7A-1001 be amended to read as follows: 48-7A-1001. (a) A partnership may become a limited liability partnership pursuant to this section. (b) The terms and conditions on which a partnership becomes a limited liability partnership must be approved by the vote necessary to amend the partnership agreement except, in the case of a partnership agreement that expressly considers obligations to contribute to the partnership, the vote necessary to amend those provisions. (c) After the approval required by subsection (b), a partnership may become a limited liability partnership by filing a statement of qualification in the Office of the Secretary of State. Delivery may be made by electronic transmission if and to the extent permitted by the Office of the Secretary of State. If the document is filed in typewritten or printed form and not transmitted electronically, the Office of the Secretary of State may require one exact or conformed copy to be delivered with the document. The statement must contain: (1) The name of the partnership; (2) The street address of the partnership's chief executive office and, if different, the street address of an office in this state, if any; (3) If the partnership does not have an office in this state, the information required by \u00a7 59-11-6; (4) A statement that the partnership elects to be a limited liability partnership; and (5) A deferred effective date, if any. (d) Repealed by SL 2008, ch 275, \u00a7 85. (e) The status of a partnership as a limited liability partnership is effective on the later of the filing of the statement or a date specified in the statement. The status remains effective, regardless of changes in the partnership, until it is canceled pursuant to subsection 48-7A-105(d) or revoked pursuant to \u00a7 48-7A-1003. (f) The status of a partnership as a limited liability partnership and the liability of its partners is not affected by errors or later changes in the information required to be contained in the statement of qualification under subsection (c). (g) The filing of a statement of qualification under this chapter or, before July 1, 2001, registering as a registered limited liability partnership under prior law establishes that a partnership has satisfied all conditions precedent to the qualification of the partnership as a limited liability partnership. (h) An amendment or cancellation of a statement of qualification is effective when it is filed or on a deferred effective date specified in the amendment or cancellation. Section 25. That \u00a7 48-7A-1003 be amended to read as follows: 48-7A-1003. (a) A limited liability partnership, and a foreign limited liability partnership authorized to transact business in this state, shall file an annual report pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 59-11-24 to 59-11-26, inclusive. (b) Repealed by SL 2008, ch 275, \u00a7 86. (c) The secretary of state may revoke the statement of qualification of a partnership that fails to file an annual report when due or pay the required filing fee. To do so, the secretary of state shall provide the partnership at least sixty days' written notice of intent to revoke the statement. The notice must be mailed to the partnership at its chief executive office set forth in the last filed statement of qualification or annual report. The notice must specify the annual report that has not been filed, the fee that has not been paid, and the effective date of the revocation. The revocation is not effective if the annual report is filed and the fee is paid before the effective date of the revocation. (d) A revocation under subsection (c) only affects a partnership's status as a limited liability partnership and is not an event of dissolution of the partnership. (e) A partnership whose statement of qualification has been revoked may apply to the secretary of state for reinstatement within two years after the effective date of the revocation. The applicant shall submit with the application the filing fee of one hundred twenty-five dollars, plus any delinquent annual reports and fees for the period prior to the reinstatement application. Delivery may be made by electronic transmission if and to the extent permitted by the Office of the Secretary of State. If the document is filed in typewritten or printed form and not transmitted electronically, the Office of the Secretary of State may require one exact or conformed copy to be delivered with the document. The application must state: (1) The name of the partnership and the effective date of the revocation; and (2) That the ground for revocation either did not exist or has been corrected. (f) A reinstatement under subsection (e) relates back to and takes effect as of the effective date of the revocation, and the partnership's status as a limited liability partnership continues as if the revocation had never occurred. Section 26. That \u00a7 48-7A-1102 be amended to read as follows: 48-7A-1102. (a) Before transacting business in this state, a foreign limited liability partnership must file a statement of foreign qualification in the Office of the Secretary of State. Delivery may be made by electronic transmission if and to the extent permitted by the Office of the Secretary of State. If the document is filed in typewritten or printed form and not transmitted electronically, the Office of the Secretary of State may require one exact or conformed copy to be delivered with the document. The statement must contain: (1) The name of the foreign limited liability partnership which satisfies the requirements of the state or other jurisdiction under whose law it is formed and ends with \"Registered Limited Liability Partnership,\" \"Limited Liability Partnership,\" \"R.L.L.P.,\" \"L.L.P.,\" \"RLLP,\" or \"LLP\"; (2) The street address of the partnership's chief executive office; (3) The information required by \u00a7 59-11-6; and (4) A deferred effective date, if any. (b) Repealed by SL 2008, ch 275, \u00a7 87. (c) The status of a partnership as a foreign limited liability partnership is effective on the later of the filing of the statement of foreign qualification or a date specified in the statement. The status remains effective, regardless of changes in the partnership, until it is canceled pursuant to subsection 48-7A-105(d) or revoked pursuant to \u00a7 48-7A-1003. (d) An amendment or cancellation of a statement of foreign qualification is effective when it is filed or on a deferred effective date specified in the amendment or cancellation."}, {"bill_id": 3153,
