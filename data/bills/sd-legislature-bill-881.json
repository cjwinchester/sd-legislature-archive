This supervision may be by personal contact or indirect contact by telecommunication. Section 2. For the purposes of this Act, genetic counseling is a communication process, conducted by appropriately trained persons that includes: (1) Assisting a person, the person's family, a health care provider, or the public with comprehending the issues inherent to genetic counseling. Such assistance may include the following: (a) Appreciating the medical, psychological, and social implications of a disorder including features, variability, usual course, and management options; (b) Learning how genetic factors contribute to the disorder and affect the chance for recurrence of the condition in other family members; (c) Understanding available options for coping with, preventing, or reducing the chance of occurrence or recurrence of a condition; (d) Selecting the most appropriate, accurate, and cost-effective methods of diagnosis; or (e) Understanding genetic tests, including diagnostic genetic tests, screening tests, or predispositional genetic tests, coordinating testing for inherited disorders, and interpreting complex genetic test results; (2) Assessing the likelihood of the occurrence or recurrence of an abnormality in the fetus in structure, function, or metabolism or of any potentially inherited or genetically influenced condition.

However, any qualified and licensed health care professional who is practicing within the professional's scope of practice may engage in the practice of genetic counseling, without being licensed pursuant to this Act, but may not use the title, genetic counselor, or any other title indicating or implying that the person is a genetic counselor unless licensed as such in this state. A violation of this section is a Class 1 misdemeanor. Section 5. Any person desiring to engage in the practice of genetic counseling in this state shall apply to the board for a license and pay the license fee. The application shall contain such information as the board may require. The license fee shall be established by the board by rules promulgated pursuant to chapter 1-26.

The licensed physician, certified nurse midwife, licensed certified nurse practitioner, licensed clinical nurse specialist, or licensed physician assistant shall maintain supervision of the patient.

Section 8. A licensed genetic counselor may provide a general seminar without a referral to a group or organization on genetic counseling if the seminar does not include individual, couple, or family specific counseling. Section 9. The board may issue a temporary license to an applicant who has paid the temporary license fee, meets all the qualifications for licensure as established in section 5 of this Act with the exception of certification by the ABMG or ABGC, and has submitted evidence to the board that the applicant is a candidate accepted to write the examination or is awaiting the results of the first examination for which the applicant is eligible after graduation from an approved genetic counseling program.

Section 11. Each license issued pursuant to this Act shall be renewed annually on a date set by the board. The board shall renew a license upon payment of the renewal fee, submission of a renewal application in a form approved by the board, and evidence satisfactory to the board of the applicant's successful completion, within a three year period prior to the application for license renewal of five continuing education units or fifty contact hours. Any genetic counselor who maintains current certification by the ABGC or ABMG may document compliance with this requirement by providing proof of current certification by the ABGC or ABMG. The board shall establish the renewal fee by rules promulgated pursuant to chapter 1-26. The fee may not exceed one hundred dollars. Section 12. The board shall promulgate rules pursuant to chapter 1-26 pertaining to fees, licensure, investigations, and disciplinary proceedings. Section 13.

Section 14. Upon application, the board may reinstate and renew a license to practice to any person whose license has been cancelled, suspended, or revoked. However, no license that has been cancelled or revoked may be reinstated and renewed prior to one year after the cancellation or revocation. The reinstatement and renewal of any license may be made in such manner and form and under such conditions as the board may require. Section 15. The board shall appoint a genetic counselor advisory committee composed of a minimum of one genetic counselor and three physicians licensed pursuant to chapter 36-4. Each committee member shall serve a term of three years. However, the terms of initial appointees shall be staggered so that no more than one member's term expires in any one year. No committee member may be appointed to more than three consecutive full terms. If a vacancy occurs, the board shall appoint a person to fill the unexpired term. The committee shall meet at least annually or as deemed necessary to conduct business. The advisory committee shall assist the board in the regulation of genetic counselors pursuant to this Act. The committee shall also make recommendations to the board regarding rules promulgated pursuant to this Act."}, {"bill_id": 881, "bill_version_id": 7393, "bill_version": "Enrolled",
