We share a past and present. We share mountain size sculptures, grandiose purple sunsets, the East/West River divide, ethnic foods and rhubarb, our own pronunciation of Pierre, pheasants and deer, Interstates 90 and 29, and four sharp seasons of weather; and WHEREAS, South Dakotans also experienced dark times, which the magazine has covered, including killer storms, rural poverty, Wounded Knee, a racial divide, and an exodus of our young people; and WHEREAS, this, our South Dakota community, has been celebrated, preserved and explored in the pages of South Dakota Magazine; and WHEREAS, after twenty-eight years as editor, Bernie is passing that title to his daughter, Katie.
