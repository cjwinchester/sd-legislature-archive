Master registration file--Contents--Public inspection--Limitations--Duty to update--Penalty. The county auditor shall maintain and safeguard a file of voters in computer format that contains the information of each person registered in each voting precinct within the county. This file shall be known as the master registration file and shall be, at all times during office hours, open to public inspection. However, public access to social security numbers, driver license numbers, and dates of birth contained in the master registration file is prohibited. The master registration file shall contain all information from each voter's registration card. The master registration file shall also include the date of the last election the voter has voted in and when the voter's information was last updated. The master registration file may also contain additional voter history information. Any voter registration form for a purged or unregistered voter shall be kept for twenty-two months. No purged or unregistered voter may be included in the master registration file. The master registration file shall be updated no less than once a month. A person who fails to comply with the requirements of this section is guilty of a Class 2 misdemeanor. Section 2. That \u00a7 12-4-18 be AMENDED. 12-4-18. Registration records--Incompetent, deceased or convicted felon--Removal--Penalty. The clerk of courts shall, within fifteen days after the close of each month, prepare and deliver to the auditor an abstract from the records of the names of persons declared mentally incompetent in the preceding month. The notice shall be sent to the county auditor of the county in which the person declared incompetent resides. Each county coroner shall, within five days after the close of each week, prepare and deliver to the auditor a list of the names of persons declared deceased in the preceding week.

Any voter identified as deceased or who is serving a sentence for a felony conviction shall be removed from the voter registration records. The State Board of Elections may promulgate rules, pursuant to chapter 1-26, determining how voter registration records shall be matched. A person who fails to comply with the requirements of this section is guilty of a Class 2 misdemeanor. Section 3. That a NEW SECTION be added: 12-4-18.1.
