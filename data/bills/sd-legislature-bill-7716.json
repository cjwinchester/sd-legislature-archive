Section 3. That the code be amended by adding a NEW SECTION to read: This Act applies to a custodian if the user resides in this state or resided in this state at the time of the user's death. This Act does not apply to any digital asset of an employer used by an employee in the ordinary course of the employer's business. Section 4. That the code be amended by adding a NEW SECTION to read: Any user may utilize an online tool to direct a custodian to disclose or not to disclose to a designated recipient some or all of the user's digital assets, including the content of electronic communications. If the online tool allows the user to modify or delete a direction at all times, a direction regarding disclosure using an online tool overrides a contrary direction by the user in a will, trust, power of attorney, or other record. If a user has not utilized an online tool to give direction under this section, or if the custodian has not provided an online tool, the user may allow for or prohibit in a will, trust, power of attorney, or any other record, disclosure to a fiduciary of some or all of the user's digital assets, including the content of electronic communications sent or received by the user. A user's direction under this section overrides a contrary provision in any terms-of-service agreement that does not require the user to act affirmatively and distinctly from the user's assent to the terms of service agreement. Section 5. That the code be amended by adding a NEW SECTION to read: This Act does not change or impair the right of any custodian or user under a terms-of-service agreement to access and use digital assets of the user. This Act does not give a fiduciary or designated recipient any new or expanded rights other than those held by the user for whom, or for whose estate, the fiduciary or designated recipient acts or represents. A fiduciary's or designated recipient's access to digital assets may be modified or eliminated by a user, by federal law, or by a terms-of-service agreement if the user has not provided direction under section 4 of this Act. Section 6. That the code be amended by adding a NEW SECTION to read: If a custodian discloses digital assets of a user under this Act, the custodian may, at the custodian's sole discretion: (1) Grant a fiduciary or designated recipient full access to the user's account; (2) Grant a fiduciary or designated recipient partial access to the user's account sufficient to perform any task with which the fiduciary or designated recipient is charged; or (3) Provide a fiduciary or designated recipient a copy in a record of any digital asset that, on the date the custodian received the request for disclosure, the user could have accessed if the user were alive and had full capacity and access to the account. A custodian may assess a reasonable administrative charge for the cost of disclosing digital assets under this Act. A custodian need not disclose under this Act a digital asset deleted by a user. If a user directs or a fiduciary requests a custodian to disclose under this Act some, but not all, of the user's digital assets, the custodian need not disclose the assets if segregation of the assets would impose an undue burden on the custodian. If the custodian believes the direction or request imposes an undue burden, the custodian or fiduciary may seek an order from the court to disclose: a subset limited by date of the user's digital assets; all of the user's digital assets to the fiduciary or designated recipient; none of the user's digital assets; or all of the user's digital assets to the court for review in camera. Section 7. That the code be amended by adding a NEW SECTION to read: If a deceased user consented to or a court directs disclosure of contents of electronic communications of the user, the custodian shall disclose to the personal representative of the estate of the user the content of an electronic communication sent or received by the user if the representative gives the custodian: (1) A written request for disclosure in physical or electronic form; (2) A certified copy of the death certificate of the user; (3) A certified copy of the letter of appointment of the representative or a small estate affidavit or court order; (4) A copy of the user's will, trust, power of attorney, or other record that provides evidence of the user's consent to disclosure of the content of electronic communications, unless the user provided direction by utilizing an online tool; and (5) If requested by the custodian: (a) A number, username, address, or other unique subscriber or account identifier assigned by the custodian to identify the user's account; (b) Evidence linking the account to the user; or (c) A finding by the court that: (i) The user had a specific account with the custodian, identifiable by the information specified in this subdivision; (ii) Disclosure of the content of electronic communications of the user would not violate 18 U.S.C. Section 2701 et seq., 47 U.S.C. Section 222, or other applicable law; (iii) Unless the user provided direction using an online tool, the user consented to disclosure of the content of electronic communications; or (iv) Disclosure of the content of electronic communications of the user is reasonably necessary for administration of the estate. Section 8. That the code be amended by adding a NEW SECTION to read: Unless the user prohibited disclosure of digital assets or the court directs otherwise, a custodian shall disclose to the personal representative of the estate of a deceased user a catalogue of electronic communications sent or received by the user and digital assets, other than the content of electronic communications, of the user, if the representative gives the custodian: (1) A written request for disclosure in physical or electronic form; (2) A certified copy of the death certificate of the user; (3) A certified copy of the letter of appointment of the representative or a small estate affidavit or court order; and (4) If requested by the custodian: (a) A number, username, address, or other unique subscriber or account identifier assigned by the custodian to identify the user's account; (b) Evidence linking the account to the user; (c) An affidavit stating that disclosure of the user's digital assets is reasonably necessary for administration of the estate; or (d) A finding by the court that the user had a specific account with the custodian, identifiable by the information specified in subsection (a) or that disclosure of the user's digital assets is reasonably necessary for administration of the estate.
