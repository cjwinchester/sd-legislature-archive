Section 8. That \u00a7 58-40-10.8 be repealed. 58-40-10.8. The coverage for a newly born child from the moment of birth or for a newly adopted child, from the beginning of the six-month adoption bonding period, shall consist of coverage of injury or sickness including the necessary care and treatment of premature birth and medically diagnosed congenital defects and birth abnormalities. Section 9. That \u00a7 58-40-10.9 be repealed. 58-40-10.9. An insurer may require notice that a newly born or newly adopted child is to be added to the policy or that coverage is to be changed from single or spousal coverage to family coverage. However, the insurer may not require notification sooner than the birth of the child or the start of the adoption bonding period. If the child is added or coverage changed to family coverage before the birth of the child or the start of the adoption bonding period, no additional premium may be charged by the insurer until the birth of the child or the start of the adoption bonding period. The insurer shall take reasonable steps to provide adequate notice to insureds of the need to alter coverage to ensure newborn or adopted children are covered and of the lack of premium adjustment until the birth of the child or the start of the adoption bonding period. An insurer is considered to have taken reasonable steps if prominent disclosure of the requirements of this section are included in a certificate, subscriber contract, evidence of coverage, or employee handbook if such are provided to all insureds. If payment of a specific premium or subscription fee is required to provide coverage for a child, the policy or contract may require that notification of birth of a newly born child or notification of the start of the six-month adoption bonding period for an adopted child and payment of the required premium or fees be furnished to the nonprofit medical and surgical service plan corporation within thirty-one days after the date of birth or start of the bonding period in order to have the coverage continued beyond the thirty-one day period. Section 10. That \u00a7 58-41-35.2 be repealed. 58-41-35.2. Any health insurance policy or indemnity type contract issued by a health maintenance organization which offers coverage for a family member of an insured or subscriber shall provide that the health insurance benefits applicable for children are payable with respect to a newly born child of the insured or subscriber from the moment of birth or to a newly adopted child of the insured or subscriber from the beginning of the six-month adoption bonding period. The newly born or newly adopted child shall be added to the policy without underwriting and without the imposition of any preexisting waiting period. Any policy or contract issued before July 1, 1984, shall, upon its next anniversary date, also provide that the health insurance benefits applicable for children are payable with respect to a newly born child of the insured or subscriber from the moment of birth or to a newly adopted child of the insured or subscriber from the beginning of the six-month adoption bonding period. Section 11. That \u00a7 58-41-35.3 be repealed. 58-41-35.3. The coverage for a newly born child from the moment of birth or for a newly adopted child, from the beginning of the six-month adoption bonding period, shall consist of coverage of injury or sickness including the necessary care and treatment of premature birth and medically diagnosed congenital defects and birth abnormalities. Section 12. That \u00a7 58-41-35.4 be repealed. 58-41-35.4. An insurer may require notice that a newly born or newly adopted child is to be added to the policy or that coverage is to be changed from single or spousal coverage to family coverage. However, the insurer may not require notification sooner than the birth of the child or the start of the adoption bonding period. If the child is added or coverage changed to family coverage before the birth of the child or the start of the adoption bonding period, no additional premium may be charged by the insurer until the birth of the child or the start of the adoption bonding period. The insurer shall take reasonable steps to provide adequate notice to insureds of the need to alter coverage to ensure newborn or adopted children are covered and of the lack of premium adjustment until the birth of the child or the start of the adoption bonding period. An insurer is considered to have taken reasonable steps if prominent disclosure of the requirements of this section are included in a certificate, subscriber contract, evidence of coverage, or employee handbook if such are provided to all insureds. If payment of a specific premium or subscription fee is required to provide coverage for a child, the policy or contract may require that notification of birth of a newly born child or notification of the start of the six-month adoption bonding period for an adopted child and payment of the required premium or fees be furnished to the nonprofit medical and surgical service plan corporation within thirty-one days after the date of birth or start of the bonding period in order to have the coverage continued beyond the thirty-one day period."}, {"bill_id": 16147, "bill_version_id": 90375,
