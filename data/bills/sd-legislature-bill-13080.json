For taxes payable in 1997 and each year thereafter, the levy for the general fund of a school district shall be as follows: (1) The maximum tax levy shall be sixteen dollars and seventy-five sixty-five cents per thousand dollars of taxable valuation subject to the limitations on agricultural property as provided in subdivision (2) of this section and owner-occupied property as provided for in subdivision (3) of this section; (2) The maximum tax levy on agricultural property for such school district shall be five dollars and seventy-five sixty-five cents per thousand dollars of taxable valuation. If the district's levies are less than the maximum levies as stated in chapter 10-13, the levies shall maintain the same proportion to each other as represented in the mathematical relationship at the maximum levies; (3) The maximum tax levy for an owner-occupied single-family dwelling as defined in \u00a7 10-13-40, for such school district may not exceed nine dollars and twenty ten cents per thousand dollars of taxable valuation. If the district's levies are less than the maximum levies as stated in chapter 10-13, the levies shall maintain the same proportion to each other as represented in the mathematical relationship at the maximum levies. All levies in this section shall be imposed on valuations where the median level of assessment represents eighty-five percent of market value as determined by the Department of Revenue. These valuations shall be used for all school funding purposes. If the district has imposed an excess levy pursuant to \u00a7 10-13-43, the levies shall maintain the same proportion to each other as represented in the mathematical relationship at the maximum levies in this section.

The district of residence prior to the custodial transfer may not include students who meet these criteria in its average daily membership after the student ceases to attend school in the resident district for more than thirty school days; (2) \"Adjusted average daily membership,\" calculated as follows: (a) For districts with an average daily membership of two hundred or less, multiply 1.2 times the average daily membership; (b) For districts with an average daily membership of less than six hundred, but greater than two hundred, raise the average daily membership to the 0.8293 power and multiply the result times 2.98; (c) For districts with an average daily membership of six hundred or more, multiply 1.0 times their average daily membership; (3) \"Index factor,\" is the annual percentage change in the consumer price index for urban wage earners and clerical workers as computed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States Department of Labor for the year before the year immediately preceding the year of adjustment or three percent, whichever is less; (4) \"Per student allocation,\" for the period January 1, 1997, to June 30, 1997, inclusive, is $1,675. For school fiscal year 1998, beginning on July 1, 1997, the per student allocation shall be $3,350 increased by the index factor.
