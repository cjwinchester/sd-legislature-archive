BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 13-29-19 be amended to read as follows: 13-29-19. A school district may charge a nominal fee for providing school bus transportation services to students whose residence is less than two and one-half ten miles from the school. The fee authorized by this section may be charged only to those parents who request school bus transportation services for their children. The amount of the fee shall be established by the local school board. Section 2. That \u00a7 13-30-1 be amended to read as follows: 13-30-1. The following types of students who do not have access to bus service furnished by the school district to which they are assigned to and from school are entitled to a transportation or board and room allowance, provided in this chapter, paid by the district where the student has school residence or by the district where the student attends if the district is receiving tuition, regardless of the type or method of conveyance used for transportation: (1) Any elementary student who attends an elementary school where the student is assigned and which is located more than two and one-half ten miles from the student's residence in either the same or any other school district; (2) Any secondary student who attends a high school located in the same district where the student is a resident and is more than two and one-half ten miles from the student's residence, if the transportation of secondary students is authorized by the school district board; (3) Any secondary student who resides in a district described in \u00a7 13-15-14 who attends a high school located more than two and one-half ten miles from the student's residence if the transportation of secondary students is authorized by the school district board. A school district having a junior high school may provide mileage, bus service, or board and room for ninth grade junior high school students at the discretion of the school board. A school district choosing to provide transportation services to ninth grade junior high school students is not required, as a result of that choice, to provide these services to tenth, eleventh or twelfth grade high school students. Section 3. That \u00a7 13-30-3 be amended to read as follows: 13-30-3. The amount of the transportation allowance is the rate established pursuant to \u00a7 3-9-1 per family for distances actually traveled in excess of two and one-half ten miles each way. No mileage may be paid for extra trips to the schoolhouse which the school board does not consider necessary nor for more miles than would be traveled if the shortest distance measured from the place on a publicly used road nearest the dwelling house of the child to the schoolhouse site were traveled. If children from more than one family are transported in the same vehicle mileage payments shall be paid to only one family. The school board may authorize additional miles if prior approval is obtained to facilitate cooperative efforts among families to share transportation duties. If children from more than one family are transported in a single vehicle, reimbursement shall be at rates established by the school board. However, the mileage reimbursement rate may not be less than the rate established pursuant to \u00a7 3-9-1. If, at the request of the parents, elementary children are assigned to a school that is further from the dwelling house than the nearest school, the board may limit the reimbursement to the mileage to the nearest school within the district. All claims for transportation allowance shall be filed with the school business manager not later than the close of the school fiscal year in which the travel for which reimbursement is sought actually occurred."}, {"bill_id": 12976, "bill_version_id": 73397, "bill_version": "House Education Engrossed", "bill_version_date": "1997-02-15T00:00:00-06:00", "bill_text": "FOR AN ACT ENTITLED, An Act to revise the mileage requirements for the reimbursement of certain school transportation costs.
