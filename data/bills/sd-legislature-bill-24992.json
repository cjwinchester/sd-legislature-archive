For the purposes of this chapter, a retail pharmacy is any pharmacy licensed under the laws of this state, and no pharmacy benefit manager may, by contract, modify that definition under contract with a 340B entity, on the basis that the 340B entity or a pharmacy under contract with a 340B entity participates in the 340B drug discount program by imposing terms or conditions that differ from a similarly situated entity that does not participate in the 340B drug discount program.
