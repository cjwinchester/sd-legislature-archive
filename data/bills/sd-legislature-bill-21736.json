WHEREAS, the South Dakota Alliance is made up of fourteen Boys and Girls Clubs and their units. These clubs serve as youth development centers for communities and their youth in the first grade through the twelfth grade; and WHEREAS, these clubs serve 12,070 youth in South Dakota, impacting 1,724 youth per day during the school year and 1,781 youth per day during the summer; and WHEREAS, the Boys and Girls Clubs provide a safe place to learn and grow, ongoing relationships with caring, adult professionals, life-enhancing programs and character development experiences, and hope and opportunity; and WHEREAS, Triple Play is a program provided by the Boys and Girls Clubs that helps to improve the overall health of club members by increasing their daily physical activity, teaching them good nutrition and fitness habits, and encouraging them to develop healthy relationships; and WHEREAS, Money Matters is a program that promotes financial responsibility and independence among club members thirteen through eighteen years of age by building their basic money management skills. Participants learn how to manage a checking account, budget, save, and invest. They also learn about starting small businesses and paying for college; and WHEREAS, Project Learn is a program that reinforces and enhances the skills and knowledge young people learn at school during the hours they spend at the club. This comprehensive strategy is based on research showing that students do much better in school when they spend their nonschool hours engaged in fun, educational activities. Project Learn also emphasizes parent involvement and collaboration between club and school professionals: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the Senate of the Eighty-second Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the House of Representatives concurring therein, that the Boys and Girls Clubs of the South Dakota Alliance be supported for their emphasis on health and fitness, financial responsibility, and education, and in recognition of the valuable service the Boys and Girls Clubs provide to the youth of the state, that future efforts for financial support from public and private sources be supported."}, {"bill_id": 21736, "bill_version_id": 113299, "bill_version": "Enrolled", "bill_version_date": "2007-03-02T17:47:46-06:00", "bill_text": ""}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 21736, "action_date": "2007-03-01T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 113232, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/113232.pdf", "status_text": "Introduced", "journal_page": 713, "committee_id_action": 924, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 21736, "action_date": "2007-03-02T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 113306, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/113306.pdf", "status_text": "Adopt Resolution", "journal_page": 737, "committee_id_action": 924, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 65880, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [3571, 3573, 3574, 3575, 3585, 3589, 3595, 3596, 3602, 3603, 3607, 3608, 3610, 3612, 3615, 3617, 3618, 3621, 3623, 3625, 3626, 3627, 3630, 3633, 3634, 3636, 3639, 3641, 3652, 3659, 3661, 3664, 3667, 3669], "Excused": [3647]}}, {"bill_id": 21736, "action_date": "2007-03-02T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 113289, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/113289.pdf", "status_text": "Introduced", "journal_page": 767, "committee_id_action": 923, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 21736, "action_date": "2007-03-02T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 113289, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/113289.pdf", "status_text": "Concur In resolution", "journal_page": 790, "committee_id_action": 923, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 67322, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [3572, 3576, 3577, 3578, 3579, 3580, 3581, 3582, 3583, 3586, 3587, 3588, 3590, 3591, 3592, 3593, 3594, 3597, 3598, 3599, 3600, 3604, 3605, 3606, 3609, 3611, 3613, 3614, 3616, 3619, 3620, 3622, 3624, 3628, 3629, 3631, 3632, 3635, 3637, 3638, 3640, 3642, 3643, 3644, 3645, 3646, 3648, 3649, 3650, 3651, 3653, 3654, 3655, 3656, 3657, 3658, 3660, 3662, 3663, 3665, 3666, 3668, 3670, 3671, 3672, 3673, 3674, 3675, 3676, 3584]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/21736"}
