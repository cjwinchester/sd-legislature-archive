(3) If a power of attorney becomes effective upon the principal's incapacity and the principal has not authorized a person to determine whether the principal is incapacitated, or the person authorized is unable or unwilling to make the determination, the power of attorney becomes effective upon a determination in a writing or other record by: (a) A physician or licensed psychologist that the principal is incapacitated within the meaning in \u00a7 59-12-1; or (b) An attorney at law, a judge, or an appropriate governmental official that the principal is incapacitated within the meaning in \u00a7 59-12-1.

(4) Termination of an agent's authority or of a power of attorney is not effective as to the agent or any other person that, without actual knowledge of the termination, acts in good faith under the power of attorney. An act performed under this section, unless otherwise invalid or unenforceable, binds the principal and the principal's successors in interest. (5) Incapacity of the principal of a power of attorney that is not durable does not revoke or terminate the power of attorney as to an agent or other person that, without actual knowledge of the incapacity, acts in good faith under the power of attorney. An act performed under this section, unless otherwise invalid or unenforceable, binds the principal and the principal's successors in interest. (6) The execution of a power of attorney does not revoke a power of attorney previously executed by the principal unless the subsequent power of attorney provides that the previous power of attorney is revoked or that all other powers of attorney are revoked. Section 10. That a NEW SECTION be added: 59-12-10. Appointment--Agents. (1) A principal may designate two or more persons to act as co-agents.

This restriction does not apply when any co-agent receives and receipts for property due the principal, when the concurrence of a majority cannot readily be obtained in the time reasonably available for emergency action necessary to act in the principal\u2019s best interest, or when a co-agent has been delegated to act for others as provided in \u00a7 59-12-23. Persons dealing with a co-agent if actually unaware that another has been appointed to serve or if advised by the agent with whom they deal that the agent has authority to act alone for any of the reasons mentioned herein, are fully protected as if the person with whom they dealt has been the sole agent. (2) A principal may designate one or more successor agents to act if an agent resigns, dies, becomes incapacitated, is not qualified to serve, or declines to serve.

(4) An agent that has actual knowledge of a breach or imminent breach of fiduciary duty by another agent shall notify the principal and, if the principal is incapacitated, take any action reasonably appropriate in the circumstances to safeguard the principal's best interest.

(2) Except as otherwise provided in the power of attorney, an agent that has accepted appointment shall: (a) Act loyally for the principal's benefit; (b) Act so as not to create a conflict of interest that impairs the agent's ability to act impartially in the principal's best interest; (c) Act with the care, competence, and diligence ordinarily exercised by agents in similar circumstances; (d) Keep an accurate and contemporaneous record of any receipt, disbursement, and transaction made on behalf of the principal including any reimbursement or compensation pursuant to \u00a7 59-12-11; (e) Cooperate with a person that has authority to make health care decisions for the principal to carry out the principal's reasonable expectations to the extent actually known by the agent and otherwise act in the principal's best interest; and (f) Attempt to preserve the principal's estate plan, to the extent actually known by the agent, if preserving the plan is consistent with the principal's best interest based on all relevant factors, including: (i) The value and nature of the principal's property; (ii) The principal's foreseeable obligations and need for maintenance; (iii) Minimization of taxes, including income, estate, inheritance, generation-skipping transfer, and gift taxes; and (iv) Eligibility for a benefit, a program, or assistance under a statute or regulation. (3) An agent that acts in good faith is not liable to any beneficiary of the principal's estate plan for failure to preserve the plan. (4) An agent that acts with care, competence, and diligence for the best interest of the principal is not liable solely because the agent also benefits from the act or has an individual or conflicting interest in relation to the property or affairs of the principal. (5) Absent a breach of duty to the principal, an agent is not liable if the value of the principal's property declines. (6) An agent that exercises authority to delegate to another person the authority granted by the principal or that engages another person on behalf of the principal is not liable for an act, error of judgment, or default of that person if the agent exercises care, competence, and diligence in selecting, instructing, and monitoring the person. (7) Except as otherwise provided in the power of attorney, an agent is not required to disclose receipts, disbursements, or transactions conducted on behalf of the principal unless ordered by a court or requested by the principal, a guardian, a conservator, another fiduciary acting for the principal, a governmental agency having authority to protect the welfare of the principal, or, upon the death of the principal, by the personal representative or successor in interest of the principal's estate.

(2) A principal may designate one or more successor agents to act if an agent resigns, dies, becomes incapacitated, is not qualified to serve, or declines to serve.

(3) An agent that acts in good faith is not liable to any beneficiary of the principal's estate plan for failure to preserve the plan.

(5) Absent a breach of duty to the principal, an agent is not liable if the value of the principal's property declines. (6) An agent that exercises authority to delegate to another person the authority granted by the principal or that engages another person on behalf of the principal is not liable for an act, error of judgment, or default of that person if the agent exercises care, competence, and diligence in selecting, instructing, and monitoring the person.
