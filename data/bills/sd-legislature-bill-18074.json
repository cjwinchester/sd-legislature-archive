Grant terms and conditions shall be set by the Board of Water and Natural Resources. The grant authorized by this section may be increased or decreased by such amounts as may be justified by reason of ordinary fluctuations in development costs incurred after September 1993, as indicated by engineering costs indices applicable for the type of construction involved.
