BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 58-29A-79 be amended to read as follows: 58-29A-79. Each member insurer may shall set off against any assessment, authorized payments made on covered claims and expenses incurred in the payment of such claims by the member insurer if they are chargeable to the account for which the assessment is made. The member insurer shall recover the amount of the assessment as provided in \u00a7 58-29A-103. Section 2. That \u00a7 58-29A-103 be amended to read as follows: 58-29A-103. The rates and premiums charged for insurance policies to which this chapter applies shall include amounts sufficient to recoup a sum equal to the amounts paid to the association by the member insurer less any amounts returned to the member insurer by the association and such rates may not be deemed excessive because they contain an amount reasonably calculated to recoup assessments paid by the member insurer. Each member insurer shall collect, over a reasonable length of time, a sum reasonably calculated to recover the assessments paid by the member insurer pursuant to this chapter. The member insured shall recover the assessments by imposing a surcharge on any insurance policy to which this chapter applies. The amount of the surcharge shall be separately stated on the policy declaration statement, schedule, or endorsement. The plan of operation may permit a member insurer to forgo collection of the surcharge from its insureds if the expense of collecting the surcharge would exceed the amount of the surcharge."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 19721, "action_date": "2005-01-27T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 103467, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/103467.pdf", "status_text": "First read in Senate and referred to", "journal_page": 207, "committee_id_action": 861, "committee_id_assigned": 835, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 19721, "action_date": "2005-02-08T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 104302, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/104302.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 835, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 19721, "action_date": "2005-02-08T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 104302, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/104302.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to 41st legislative day", "journal_page": 387, "committee_id_action": 835, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 59716, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [3150, 3198, 3202, 3236, 3157, 3212], "Nay": [3241]}}]}
