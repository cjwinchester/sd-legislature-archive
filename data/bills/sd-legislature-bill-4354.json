BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. No physician has a legal duty to perform a surgical or medical procedure for the sole purpose of terminating the life of an unborn human being, at any age of gestation, for any reason, regardless of who may request the physician to do so. Section 2. No physician has a legal duty to test for, or advise a pregnant mother to test for, a genetic illness of an unborn human being at any age of gestation for the purpose of obtaining information to be considered in determining whether to terminate the life of an unborn human being. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section the legal or professional duty of a physician to test for conditions of the unborn human being for the purpose of treating such conditions is in no way affected. Section 3. No civil cause of action for wrongful birth is cognizable in any court in South Dakota, and no damages may be recovered in a suit for wrongful birth. Section 4. No civil cause of action for wrongful life is cognizable in any court in South Dakota, and no damages may be recovered in a suit for wrongful life. Section 5. The term, human being, as used in this Act, is the same as defined by subdivision 34-23A-1(4). Section 6. The term, civil cause of action for a wrongful birth, means a civil cause of action for money damages awarded to a parent or other relative or care giver of a minor child, born with a physical illness, disease, congenital anomaly, or physical or mental disability, on the basis that if the pregnant mother of such minor child had known of such illness, disease, congenital anomaly or physical or mental disability, prior to the birth of the child, the pregnant mother would have terminated the life of the unborn human being prior to live birth. Section 7. The term, civil cause of action for wrongful life, means a civil cause of action for money damages awarded to a person born with an illness, disease, congenital anomaly or physical or mental disability, brought on the basis that had the pregnant mother of such person known of such illness, disease, congenital anomaly or physical or mental disability, his or her pregnant mother would have terminated the life of such person prior to his or her live birth. Section 8. Nothing in this Act affects or precludes a civil cause of action for professional negligence in the medical treatment of a pregnant mother and her unborn child, other than claims for wrongful birth and wrongful life."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 4354, "action_date": "2013-01-28T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 24817, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/24817.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 214, "committee_id_action": 202, "committee_id_assigned": 198, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 4354, "action_date": "2013-02-15T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 25538, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/25538.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 198, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 4354, "action_date": "2013-02-15T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 25850, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/25850.pdf", "status_text": "Tabled", "journal_page": 427, "committee_id_action": 198, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 13860, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [353, 351, 348, 350, 359, 398, 406, 416, 402, 381, 334], "Excused": [324, 369]}}]}
