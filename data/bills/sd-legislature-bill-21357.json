If a school district does not spend at least sixty-five percent of its operational expenditures on classroom instructional expenditures in fiscal year 2008, the school district, for fiscal year 2009 and each fiscal year thereafter, shall increase the percentage of its operational expenditures that it spends on classroom instructional expenditures by at least two percent until the school district spends at least sixty-five percent of its operational expenditures on classroom instructional expenditures as required by this Act. Section 5. Each school district shall submit its annual budget showing the district's classroom instructional expenditures as a percentage of its operational expenditures to the secretary of education, who shall verify that the planned classroom instructional expenditures of the school district meet the requirements of this Act. Section 6. That chapter 13-13 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Any school district that fails to meet the requirements of this Act and is not granted a waiver pursuant to section 7 of this Act, shall receive foundation program state aid, distributed according to the provisions of \u00a7 \u00a7 13-13-10.1 to 13-13-41, based not on the per student allocation as defined in subsection 13-13-10.1(4) for the current school fiscal year, but on the per student allocation for the prior school fiscal year, and the school district's foundation program state aid funding shall remain at that level until the secretary of education verifies that the school district is meeting the requirements of this Act.
