BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 22-22-1 be amended to read as follows: 22-22-1. Rape is an act of sexual penetration accomplished with any person under any of the following circumstances: (1) If the victim is less than thirteen years of age; or (2) Through the use of force, coercion, or threats of immediate and great bodily harm against the victim or other persons within the victim's presence, accompanied by apparent power of execution; or (3) If the victim is incapable, because of physical or mental incapacity, of giving consent to such act; or (4) If the victim is incapable of giving consent because of any intoxicating, narcotic, or anesthetic agent or hypnosis; or (5) If the victim is thirteen years of age, but less than sixteen years of age, and the perpetrator is at least three years older than the victim. In any prosecution pursuant to subdivision (4) of this section, the defendant's assessment of the victim's capacity to give or withhold consent is not an element of the crime, and the prosecution need not prove that the defendant knew or reasonably should have known that the victim's intoxicated condition rendered the victim incapable of consenting. A violation of subdivision (1) of this section is rape in the first degree, which is a Class C felony. A violation of subdivision (2) of this section is rape in the second degree which is a Class 1 felony. A violation of subdivision (3) or (4) of this section is rape in the third degree, which is a Class 2 felony. A violation of subdivision (5) of this section is rape in the fourth degree, which is a Class 3 felony. Notwithstanding the provisions of \u00a7 23A-42-2, no statute of limitations applies to any charge brought pursuant to subdivisions (1) or (2) of this section. Otherwise a charge brought pursuant to this section may be commenced at any time prior to the time the victim becomes of age twenty-five or within seven years of the commission of the crime, whichever is longer."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 4360, "action_date": "2013-01-23T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 24441, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/24441.pdf", "status_text": "First read in Senate and referred to", "journal_page": 177, "committee_id_action": 200, "committee_id_assigned": 181, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 4360, "action_date": "2013-01-31T08:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 24887, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/24887.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 181, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 4360, "action_date": "2013-02-05T08:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 25074, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/25074.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 181, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 4360, "action_date": "2013-02-12T08:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 25423, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/25423.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 181, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 4360, "action_date": "2013-02-12T08:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 25523, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/25523.pdf", "status_text": "Tabled", "journal_page": 368, "committee_id_action": 181, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 13616, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [327, 419, 336, 325, 362, 339], "Excused": [330]}}]}
