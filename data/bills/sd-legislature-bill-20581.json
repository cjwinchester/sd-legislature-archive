That chapter 32-17 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: No person may operate a vehicle with a tail lamp as required by \u00a7 32-17-8 or a stop lamp as required by \u00a7 32-17-8.1, if the lamp has any type of decorative covering that restricts the amount of light emitted when the lamp is in use. This prohibition does not apply to any type of decorative covering originally equipped on the vehicle at the time of manufacture and sale. A violation of this section is a petty offense. 250 copies of this document were printed by the South Dakota Legislative Research Council at a cost of $.038 per page. .
