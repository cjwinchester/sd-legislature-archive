The law enforcement officer shall indicate whether the driver has produced evidence of financial responsibility on the citation and shall write the driver's evidence of financial responsibility on the accident report. If the driver fails to provide evidence of financial responsibility at the time the citation or the accident report is issued, the law enforcement officer may issue the driver a citation for a violation of \u00a7 32-35-113 and may require surrender of the vehicle as provided in section 1 of this Act .
