The Department of Health may establish a program to assist rural health care facilities in recruiting eligible health care professionals as defined pursuant to section 3 of this Act. Section 2. A rural health care facility eligible to participate in the recruitment assistance program is any rural health care facility which: (1) Is located in a community with a population of ten thousand or less; (2) Is licensed pursuant to chapter 34-12 or certified under Title XVIII or XIX of the Social Security Act as amended through December 31, 2011; and (3) Agrees to provide its portion of the recruitment assistance payment payable to a health care professional who practices in the health care facility as required by this Act. A rural health care facility may have up to three eligible health care professionals per year participate in the program. Section 3. A health care professional is eligible to participate in the recruitment assistance program, established pursuant to this Act, if the health care professional is licensed or certified to practice in his or her profession in South Dakota and agrees to practice full time in an eligible rural health care facility for a minimum period of three years. No more than sixty health care professionals may participate in the program each year. The Department of Health shall promulgate rules pursuant to chapter 1-26 to specify those health care professionals eligible to receive incentive payments under this recruitment assistance program. Section 4.

The secretary shall pay the required amount out of funds appropriated by the Legislature for such purpose. The incentive shall be paid upon the health care professional's completion of the required three-year practice period. However, a rural health facility may pay its portion of the incentive at any time during the three-year period. Section 6.
