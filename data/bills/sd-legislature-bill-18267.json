If a contractor or subcontractor, as defined in chapters 10-46A and 10-46B, uses tangible personal property in the performance of his a contract or to fulfill contract or subcontract obligations, whether the title to the property is in the name of the contractor, subcontractor, contractee, subcontractee, or any other person, or whether the titleholder of the property would be subject to pay the sales or use tax, the contractor or subcontractor shall pay a tax at the rate prescribed by \u00a7 10-45-2 , . However, any tangible personal property fabricated by a contractor or subcontractor in South Dakota and used by such contractor or subcontractor, as defined in chapters 10-46A and 10-46B, in the performance of a contract for any public corporation of any other state of the United States or the District of Columbia or any organization located in any other state of the United States or the District of Columbia that has been recognized as an exempt organization under \u00a7 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, is exempted from the provisions of this chapter. The value of the tangible personal property shall be measured by the purchase price or fair market value of the property, whichever is greater, unless the property has been previously subjected to a sales or use tax, in this state and the tax due thereon has been paid. However, if the contractor or subcontractor fabricates tangible personal property for use in the performance of his a contract, fair market value excludes the value of the contractor's or subcontractor's fabrication costs. If a manufacturer's product is being installed by such manufacturer outside of this state and the value of the installation work is less than ten percent of the total value of the contract, no use tax is owed on the material and tangible personal property used in the product.
