No governmental entity, including those adopting home rule pursuant to S.D. Const., Art.

The provisions of this Article do not apply to industrial parks or utilities, or to the expansion or creation of infrastructure by a governmental entity for the provision of public services, such as roads, bridges, utilities, buildings, water, sewer, and other services not suitable for private enterprise to provide. Section 6. That Article XXX of the Constitution of the State of South Dakota, be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: \u00a7 5. If a governmental entity other than the State of South Dakota desires to enter into the sale of goods, commodities, or services that the governmental entity is not presently providing on the effective date of this Article, the governmental entity shall: (1) Propose an ordinance describing the goods, commodities, or services to be provided.

Any interested person shall be given a full, fair, and complete opportunity to be heard at the hearing, and the governing body may refuse or adopt the ordinance with or without amendment; and (3) Any ordinance finally adopted by the governing body is subject to referendum. The resolution shall be effective twenty days after the completed publication thereof unless the referendum is invoked. A majority vote of the electorate voting is required to approve the ordinance.
