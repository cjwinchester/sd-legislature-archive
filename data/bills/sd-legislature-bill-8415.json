BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That the code be amended by adding a NEW SECTION to read: As used in this Act the term, employer, means a private employer who has fifty or more employees in private employment in this state for each working day in each of twenty or more calendar weeks in the current or immediately preceding calendar year. The term does not include a nonprofit religious, charitable, fraternal or other organization that qualifies as a tax-exempt organization pursuant to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 501(c). Section 2.

Section 3. That the code be amended by adding a NEW SECTION to read: An employee is entitled to accrue paid sick leave at a rate of not less than one hour for every thirty hours worked by the employee. For the purposes of this calculation, a salaried employee shall be deemed to work forty hours per week, unless the employee's normal week of work is less than forty hours, in which case paid sick leave shall accrue based upon the hours worked in that employee's normal week of work. Section 4.

Section 5. That the code be amended by adding a NEW SECTION to read: Paid sick leave shall be compensated at the rate of pay at which the employee is compensated at the time the leave is taken, and paid on the same payday as the hours taken are normally paid. For the purposes of this calculation, the compensation rate for an employee who is paid by salary, commission, piece rate or a method other than an hourly wage shall be calculated by dividing the employee's total wages paid for the immediately preceding ninety days by the number of hours worked during that period. An employer may limit the amount of paid sick leave an employee uses to twenty-four hours per year. Section 6. That the code be amended by adding a NEW SECTION to read: An employer may require an employee who uses paid sick leave for three or more consecutive days to provide, upon his or her return to work, a reasonable certification of the need for the leave. The reasonable certification may include, without limitation, a signed document from a provider of health care affirming the illness of the employee or a dependent of the employee. Section 7. That the code be amended by adding a NEW SECTION to read: An employer may set a minimum increment of paid sick leave, not to exceed two hours, that an employee may use at any one time. Section 8.

An employee may use accrued paid sick leave: (1) For the diagnosis, care or treatment of an existing health condition of, or preventive care for, the employee or a member of the employee's family or household; or (2) To obtain counseling or assistance or to participate in any court proceedings related to domestic violence or sexual assault.
