WHEREAS, the United States Postal Service has recently embarked on a number of programs pursuant to which the postal service engages in nonpostal businesses and sells many nonpostal goods and services at post offices, including clothing, mugs, novelty items, photocopying services, packaging materials, and other nonpostal goods and services; and WHEREAS, various state and local governments have enacted sales and use taxes on the sale or consumption of goods or services within the state or their various political subdivisions; and WHEREAS, the postal service does not collect and remit state or local sales and use taxes on its sale of nonpostal goods or services; and WHEREAS, the postal service bases its noncollection of sales and use taxes on the Supremacy Clause of the United States and the doctrine of intergovernmental tax immunity; and WHEREAS, the sale of nonpostal goods or services by the postal service is not in accordance with the performance of a governmental function but rather is the type of activity engaged in by private enterprises that are subject to state and local sales and use taxes; and WHEREAS, the postal service's practice of selling nonpostal goods and services while at the same time not collecting and remitting sales and use taxes on the sale of such nonpostal goods and services puts local tax-paying retailers selling similar items at an economic disadvantage and also has a negative impact on state and local treasuries as a result of the loss of tax revenues that would otherwise be received: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the House of Representatives of the Seventy- fourth Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the Senate concurring therein, that the South Dakota Legislature hereby requests the United States Congress to enact legislation to prohibit the sale by the postal service of such nonmonopoly related goods and services and prohibit further service offerings and advertisements by the postal service in areas where the general public is presently served by private industry."}, {"bill_id": 14896, "bill_version_id": 81275, "bill_version": "Enrolled", "bill_version_date": "1999-03-04T00:00:00-06:00", "bill_text": "March 2, 1999 March 4, 1999"}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 14896, "action_date": "1999-03-02T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": null, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/None.pdf", "status_text": "Adopt Resolution", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 616, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 42220, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [2207, 2220, 2232, 2253, 2255, 2267, 2276, 2288, 2291, 2300, 2301, 2277, 2282]}}, {"bill_id": 14896, "action_date": "1999-03-02T09:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 81897, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/81897.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 616, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 14896, "action_date": "1999-03-02T09:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 81897, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/81897.pdf", "status_text": "Adopt Resolution", "journal_page": 839, "committee_id_action": 616, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 42223, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [2207, 2220, 2232, 2253, 2255, 2267, 2276, 2288, 2291, 2300, 2301, 2277, 2282]}}, {"bill_id": 14896, "action_date": "1999-03-04T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 81766, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/81766.pdf", "status_text": "Adopt Resolution", "journal_page": 896, "committee_id_action": 628, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 43647, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [2200, 2203, 2204, 2207, 2208, 2209, 2210, 2211, 2212, 2213, 2214, 2218, 2219, 2220, 2222, 2223, 2227, 2228, 2229, 2231, 2232, 2236, 2237, 2238, 2240, 2243, 2244, 2247, 2248, 2249, 2250, 2253, 2255, 2256, 2257, 2260, 2261, 2264, 2265, 2266, 2267, 2268, 2271, 2272, 2273, 2276, 2277, 2278, 2279, 2281, 2282, 2284, 2286, 2287, 2288, 2290, 2291, 2295, 2296, 2297, 2301, 2302, 2303, 2245], "Nay": [2216, 2254, 2298], "Excused": [2233, 2262, 2300]}}, {"bill_id": 14896, "action_date": "1999-03-04T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 81781, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/81781.pdf", "status_text": "Concur In resolution", "journal_page": 780, "committee_id_action": 629, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 42288, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [2199, 2201, 2202, 2206, 2215, 2221, 2224, 2226, 2230, 2235, 2241, 2242, 2251, 2259, 2263, 2270, 2275, 2280, 2283, 2285, 2289, 2294, 2299], "Nay": [2205, 2217, 2239, 2246, 2252, 2258, 2269, 2274, 2292, 2293], "Excused": [2225, 2234]}}]}
