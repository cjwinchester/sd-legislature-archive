BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 49-16A-91 be amended to read as follows: 49-16A-91. If the owner of a tract of land abutting on a road within this state plans to inclose the tract and constructs a good and sufficient fence about the tract on all sides except along the side abutting the road, the railroad shall supply the landowner with the materials needed to construct a fence not less than four and one-half feet high along the side abutting the road . If the owner incloses a tract of land with a woven wire fence with wires crossing each other close enough to keep sheep and hogs confined, the railroad shall supply the landowner with the materials needed to construct a like fence along its right-of-way on the side of the tract so far as it extends along the road. The railroad shall maintain or supply the materials to maintain the fence in good repair and condition until released by the owner of the tract , or until the owner of the tract ceases to maintain his portion of the fence in good repair and condition for one year. The requirements of this section do not apply to track that is out of service or is classified as \"excepted\" or \"Class 1\" by the Federal Railway Administration. A railroad is not required to build fences nor be liable for any damages for refusal to build fences when the earth is frozen. Section 2. That \u00a7 49-16A-92 be repealed. 49-16A-92. If the owner of a tract of land has completed his portion of the fence around the proposed inclosure, he shall give written notice of its completion to the railroad on whose road the tract is situated, by service on the railroad describing in the notice the situation of the tract and the appropriate number of acres to be inclosed and the length of the fence required along the line of the railroad to complete the proposed inclosure. The railroad shall supply the materials needed to construct and complete its portion of the fence within forty-five days after the service of the notice. Section 3. That \u00a7 49-16A-93 be repealed. 49-16A-93. If a railroad neglects or refuses to comply with the requirements of \u00a7\u00a7 49-16A- 91 and 49-16A-92, the owner of the tract may construct or repair the fence along the road, and the railroad is liable to the owner for an amount not exceeding the actual cost of all materials used in the construction or repair of the fence of like construction but excluding all cost of labor, which may be recovered in a civil action. The railroad is also liable for all damages accruing by reason of its neglect or refusal. However, a railroad is not required to build fences nor be liable for any damages for refusal to build fences when the earth is frozen."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 1154, "action_date": "2009-01-28T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 6143, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/6143.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 163, "committee_id_action": 56, "committee_id_assigned": 51, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 1154, "action_date": "2009-02-05T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 6733, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/6733.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 51, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 1154, "action_date": "2009-02-05T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 6913, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/6913.pdf", "status_text": "Motion to amend", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 51, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 1154, "action_date": "2009-02-05T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 6913, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/6913.pdf", "status_text": "Motion to amend", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 51, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 1154, "action_date": "2009-02-05T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 6913, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/6913.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to the 41st legislative day", "journal_page": 309, "committee_id_action": 51, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 3694, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [708, 730, 711, 731, 641], "Yea": [672, 738, 696, 637, 734, 657, 733, 654]}}]}
