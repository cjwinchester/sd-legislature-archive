BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. There is hereby created the Experimental Teacher Recruitment Grant Program within the Department of Education. Section 2. There is hereby appropriated from the general fund, after the transfer of earnings from the education enhancement trust fund created in Article XII, section 6 of the South Dakota Constitution, pursuant to \u00a7 4-5-29.2, the sum of six hundred thousand dollars ($600,000), or so much thereof that may be necessary, to the Department of Education for allocation to school districts to provide funding for the grants provided pursuant to this Act. Section 3. The department shall provide Experimental Teacher Recruitment Grants in amounts up to ten thousand dollars per year for up to three years to a maximum of twenty eligible school districts. A grant provided under the provisions of this Act may be in an amount less than ten thousand dollars per year if the secretary of education determines that a lesser grant is adequate to attract qualified applicants to a particular teacher vacancy. Section 4. For the purposes of this Act, an eligible school district is a school district that the Department of Education determines to have at least one of the following: (1) The school district has at least one teacher vacancy in a subject area of critical need that the district has been unable to fill due to the certification requirements necessary to fill the vacancy; or (2) The school district has at least one teacher vacancy in a core subject area that the district has been unable to fill due to the sparse population of the area where the vacancy is located; or (3) The school district has at least one teacher vacancy that it has been unable to fill, and it is a vacancy the district needs to fill to maintain the required level of educational quality for the students of the district. Section 5. Any eligible school district that receives a grant under the provisions of this Act shall pay the funds received to the teacher who is hired to fill the vacancy in three payments. A receiving school district may establish a grant period of three years and provide the grant payments to the teacher for three consecutive years or, if approved by the secretary of education, a school district may establish a longer grant period and provide the grant payments over a longer period of time not to exceed five years. The grant payments are in addition to the teacher's regular salary as documented in the school district's salary policy that is in effect at the time the vacancy occurs. No school district may use a grant payment to reduce or offset the regular salary of the teacher. Section 6. Any teacher who accepts a teaching position under this program, but who resigns from the teaching position or is terminated from the position for cause before the end of the established grant period, shall reimburse the receiving school district for the grant payments received. However, any teacher who accepts a teaching position under this program and is subsequently terminated for nondisciplinary reasons prior to the end of the established grant period is not obligated to reimburse the school district for the grant payments received. Section 7. In order to be considered for a Experimental Teacher Recruitment Grant, a school district shall apply to the Department of Education and provide written documentation of any such teacher vacancy that exists within the district, the certification requirements a teacher must possess to fill the vacancy, the length of time the vacancy has existed, and the search process that the district has undertaken to fill the vacancy. Section 8. At the discretion of the secretary of education, any teacher who accepts a teaching position under the program authorized by this Act may be required to teach students in more than one school district through distance learning, through a cooperative educational service unit, or through a sharing agreement between the hiring school district and one or more additional school districts. Section 9. The Department of Education shall promulgate rules pursuant to chapter 1-26 to establish program eligibility, application procedures, and criteria for identifying subject areas of critical need and selecting grant recipients from among the school districts that apply. Section 10. Beginning in 2005, the Department of Education shall, for three consecutive years, annually report to the Legislature on the impact that the Experimental Teacher Recruitment Grant Program has had on participating school districts' ability to fill teacher vacancies, and in particular, on the need for those school districts to fill vacancies with teachers who are given temporary certification to fill the requirements of the positions under an authority to act established in ARSD 24:02:02:02:02. Section 11. This Act is effective on June 20, 2004."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 18660, "action_date": "2004-01-23T12:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 99770, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/99770.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 188, "committee_id_action": 831, "committee_id_assigned": 820, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 18660, "action_date": "2004-02-06T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 100784, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/100784.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 820, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 18660, "action_date": "2004-02-06T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 100784, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/100784.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to 36th legislative day", "journal_page": 432, "committee_id_action": 820, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 57132, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [3049, 3051, 3053, 3069, 3082, 3107, 3108, 3110, 3131, 3141, 3145], "Nay": [3067, 3104, 3088, 3083]}}, {"bill_id": 18660, "action_date": "2004-02-06T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 100784, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/100784.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to 36th legislative day", "journal_page": 432, "committee_id_action": 820, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 57132, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [3049, 3051, 3053, 3069, 3082, 3107, 3108, 3110, 3131, 3141, 3145], "Nay": [3067, 3104, 3088, 3083]}}]}
