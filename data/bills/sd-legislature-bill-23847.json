Section 10. That chapter 51A-17 be amended with a NEW SECTION: Upon the establishment of a statutory trust in accordance with section 9 of this Act, or when any funds are drawn on a letter of credit pursuant to this section, the director shall notify the applicable regulator of each state in which the licensee is licensed to engage in money transmission, if any, of the establishment of the trust or the funds drawn on the letter of credit, as applicable. Notice is satisfied if performed pursuant to a multistate agreement or through the Nationwide Multistate Licensing System. Funds drawn on a letter of credit and any other permissible investments held in trust for the benefit of the purchasers and holders of the licensee's outstanding money transmission obligations, are deemed held in trust for the benefit of such purchasers and holders on a pro rata and equitable basis in accordance with statutes pursuant to which permissible investments are required to be held in this state and other states. Any statutory trust established under this section shall be terminated upon extinguishment of all of the licensee's outstanding money transmission obligations. Section 11.

Section 14. That chapter 51A-17 be amended with a NEW SECTION: A licensee adding or replacing any key individual shall provide notice in a manner prescribed by the director within fifteen days after the effective date of the key individual's appointment and provide information as required by \u00a7\u00a7 51A-17-12, 51A-17-13, and 51A-17-14 within forty-five days of the effective date. Section 15. That chapter 51A-17 be amended with a NEW SECTION: Within ninety days of the date on which the notice provided pursuant to \u00a7 51A-17-23 was determined to be complete, the director may issue a notice of disapproval of a key individual if the competence, experience, character, or integrity of the individual would not be in the best interests of the public or the customers of the licensee to permit the individual to be a key individual of such licensee. The key individual is deemed approved if not disapproved within ninety days after the date on which the notice was determined to be complete. A notice of disapproval shall contain a statement of the basis for disapproval and shall be sent to the licensee and the disapproved individual. A licensee may appeal a notice of disapproval pursuant to chapter 1-26 after receipt of such notice of disapproval. Section 16. That chapter 51A-17 be amended with a NEW SECTION: If a multistate licensing process includes a key individual notice review and disapproval process pursuant to \u00a7 51A-17-23 and the licensee avails itself or is otherwise subject to the multistate licensing process, the director is authorized and encouraged to accept the determination of another state if the investigating state has sufficient staffing, expertise, and minimum standards for the purposes of \u00a7 51A-17-23. If South Dakota is the lead investigative state, the director is authorized and encouraged to investigate the applicant pursuant to \u00a7 51A-17-23 and the timeframes established by agreement through the multistate licensing process.
