Any school district that has a fall enrollment, as defined in \u00a7 13-13-10.1, of less than one hundred and is not a sparse school district, as defined in \u00a7 13-13-78, shall reorganize with another school district or other school districts to create a newly reorganized school district with a fall enrollment of one hundred or greater.

After July 1, 2007, if the fall enrollment of any school district that is not sparse falls to one hundred or below, that school district shall prepare a plan for reorganization within two years. If any such district fails to prepare a plan for reorganization by the deadline, the South Dakota Board of Education shall prepare a reorganization plan for the district to dissolve and attach to other school districts.
