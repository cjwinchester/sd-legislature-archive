BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That chapter 10-12 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: If the portion of the total taxable valuation for taxes payable in 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2015 of the state attributed to agricultural property increases by a greater percentage than the other classifications of property on a statewide aggregate basis, the median level of assessment as defined in \u00a7 \u00a7 10-12-31.1 and 10-13-37 shall be adjusted proportionally to maintain the taxable valuation for taxes payable in 2009 base between agricultural property and all other property. The taxable valuation base for all other classification of property shall be adjusted by the percentage increase of value resulting from any improvements or change in use of real property. Any adjustments in the median level of assessments made pursuant to \u00a7 \u00a7 10- 12-31.1 and 10-13-37 shall be based on maintaining the relationship between the total statewide taxable valuation of agricultural property and the other classifications of property as adjusted for improvements and change in use. Section 2. That \u00a7 10-12-31.1 be amended to read as follows: 10-12-31.1. Notwithstanding other provision of law, when applying the levies for school purposes for taxes payable in 2010 and each year thereafter , the county director of equalization of each county shall adjust the level of assessment in that district so that the level of assessment as indicated by the most recent assessment to sales ratio as provided for in \u00a7 10-11-55 in that district are equal to eighty-five percent of market value and the most recent assessment to full agricultural land value ratio as provided for in \u00a7 10-11-57 in that district are equal to eighty-five eighty-four percent of market value. The Department of Revenue and Regulation shall provide the director of equalization of each county all of the factors of adjustment necessary for the computations required in this section. Section 3. That \u00a7 10-13-37 be amended to read as follows: 10-13-37. Property For taxes payable in 2010 and each year thereafter, property taxes shall be levied on valuations where the median level of assessment represents eighty-five percent of the market value as determined by the Department of Revenue and Regulation. However, for any property classified as agricultural property, the director of equalization shall make the necessary adjustments, so that the median level of assessment represents eighty-four percent of the market value as determined by the Department of Revenue and Regulation. Section 4. That chapter 10-6 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Notwithstanding the provisions of \u00a7 10-6-74, if any nonagricultural or owner-occupied property sells for more than one hundred fifty percent of its assessed value after November 1, 2007, the sale of such property shall be used to value other real property if the sale is an arms- length transaction. However, for the taxable valuation for taxes payable in 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014, no nonagricultural or owner-occupied property's valuation may increase more than five percent per year because of the sales provided by this section.

However, for the taxable valuation for taxes payable in 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014, no agricultural property's valuation may increase more than fifteen percent per year because of the sales provided by this section. The sales of agricultural property may only be used in a sales ratio study as allowed by this section. Section 6. That \u00a7 10-6-33.14 be amended to read as follows: 10-6-33.14. Any agricultural land, as defined in \u00a7 10-6-31.3, which sells for more than one two hundred fifty percent of its agricultural income value, is hereby classified for purposes of ad valorem taxation as a nonagricultural acreage. However, any agricultural land that is converted to use other than agricultural before the next legal assessment date shall be classified according to its actual use. The agricultural income value shall be determined pursuant to \u00a7 10- 6-33.15. Section 7. That \u00a7 10-6-33.15 be amended to read as follows: 10-6-33.15. For the purposes of \u00a7 10-6-33.14, the agricultural income value shall be determined using capitalized actual annual cash rent. The actual annual cash rent is the actual annual cash rent, excluding the actual per acre tax on agricultural land, determined through an analysis of actual arm's length rental agreements collected within the county in the year prior to the year for which the income value is being determined. The annual cash rent shall be capitalized at seven and three-fourths seven percent. Section 8. That \u00a7 10-12-42 be amended to read as follows: 10-12-42.
