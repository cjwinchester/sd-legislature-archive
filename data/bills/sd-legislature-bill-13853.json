BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. On and after July 1, 1999, any provision of the South Dakota Codified Laws that requires any document, instrument, report, form, or other writing to be notarized by a notary public shall be construed to mean that affirmation by the person who executed the document, instrument, report, form, or other writing is also permissible. Such affirmation is to be deemed as effective as notarization. Section 2. Any affirmation that is to be considered sufficient to satisfy the provisions of this Act shall be in writing, shall be signed by the person who executed the document, instrument, report, form, or other writing, and shall contain a statement that the signer declares or affirms under penalty of perjury that the signer has examined the document, instrument, report, form, or other writing, and finds it to be true and correct in all things to the best of the signer's knowledge and belief. Section 3. If, after January 1, 1999, the Legislature enacts or reenacts any provision including any requirement for notarization without making reference to this Act or to affirmation, such provisions shall be construed to be that notarization is required and that affirmation will not suffice."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 13853, "action_date": "1998-01-21T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 76896, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/76896.pdf", "status_text": "First read in Senate and referred to", "journal_page": 143, "committee_id_action": 601, "committee_id_assigned": 583, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 13853, "action_date": "1998-01-26T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 76565, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/76565.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 583, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 13853, "action_date": "1998-01-26T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 76565, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/76565.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to 36th legislative day", "journal_page": 188, "committee_id_action": 583, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 39767, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [2121, 2125, 2166, 2122, 2156, 2179], "Nay": [2140, 2196, 2137]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/13853"}
