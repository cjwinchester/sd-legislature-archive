WHEREAS, in South Dakota and communities around the nation, parades have been a time-honored method of marking special occasions and local traditions, serving as a source of family entertainment and community pride; and WHEREAS, horses and other animal entries in community parades always serve to enhance the entertainment and educational value of the event, while allowing the owners to showcase their animals as well as their riding, driving, and showmanship skills; and WHEREAS, the use of horses, mules, and animal teams hitched to wagons or carriages in parades has a long-standing history, but it cannot be forgotten that such animals, if not properly trained and attended, can pose a safety hazard to parade participants and onlookers; and WHEREAS, an accident at the Wagner South Dakota Labor Day parade in 2010 resulted in the hospitalization of three people when two mules hauling a wagon in the parade were spooked and veered into the crowd; and WHEREAS, at a 2010 Fourth of July Parade in Bellevue, Iowa, one person was killed and twenty-three were injured when horses pulling a carriage bolted and ran several blocks along the parade route, striking numerous bystanders, many of them children sitting on the curb; and WHEREAS, in addition to the tragedy in Bellevue, deaths related to parade animals have been recorded in recent years in Tucson, Arizona; Cody, Wyoming; Clemmons, North Carolina; Davie, Florida; and Pasadena, California, with injuries occurring in numerous other communities as well; and WHEREAS, injuries caused by parade animals can be prevented if officials and parade participants follow simple and common-sense precautions in dealing with the animals, such as the use of outriders or grooms with teams of horses, mules, or oxen, age limits for riders and outriders, and other practices appropriate for the occasion: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the House of Representatives of the Eighty-sixth Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the Senate concurring therein, that the South Dakota Legislature urges local officials, parade organizers and administrators, and parade participants to take careful precautions relating to horses and other animal entries in community parades to ensure that the animals are under control and do not endanger parade participants and onlookers."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 2916, "action_date": "2011-02-24T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 17348, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/17348.pdf", "status_text": "First read and referred to", "journal_page": 512, "committee_id_action": 115, "committee_id_assigned": 108, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 2916, "action_date": "2011-03-02T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 17497, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/17497.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 108, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 2916, "action_date": "2011-03-02T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 17713, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/17713.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to the 41st legislative day", "journal_page": 595, "committee_id_action": 108, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 9731, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [12, 53, 60, 51, 36, 61, 57, 37, 5, 35], "Nay": [59], "Excused": [58, 91]}}]}
