BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 41-6-18.1 be amended to read as follows: 41-6-18.1. It is a Class 2 misdemeanor for a nonresident to hunt, take or kill waterfowl without a special nonresident waterfowl license and a federal migratory bird stamp or in violation of the conditions of the licenses or the rules of the Game, Fish and Parks Commission. A special nonresident waterfowl license, except as otherwise provided in this title, entitles the licensee to hunt waterfowl for ten consecutive days. Four dollars Revenue received from the sale of each nonresident waterfowl license shall be placed in the in excess of four thousand annually shall be placed in the Department of Game, Fish and Parks' land acquisition and development fund. The moneys from this fund shall be used to acquire by purchase or lease real property to be used primarily for game production or to otherwise acquire real property to be used for providing waterfowl hunting public access primarily in counties adjacent to the Missouri River. For each of the first four thousand nonresident waterfowl license licenses sold, an amount equal to the cost of a habitat stamp shall be placed into the game, fish and parks fund and shall be used for the purpose of restoring the state pheasant and wildlife populations as provided in \u00a7 41-2-34.1. For each of the first four thousand nonresident waterfowl license licenses sold, an amount equal to the cost of the waterfowl restoration stamp shall be included with the moneys collected from the sale of resident waterfowl restoration stamps. This license shall be in such form as the Game, Fish and Parks Commission shall prescribe. The provision in this section limiting the validity of a nonresident waterfowl license to ten consecutive days does not apply in Union, Clay, Bon Homme, Yankton , and Charles Mix counties and in such counties, the nonresident waterfowl license shall be valid during the same period as is a resident waterfowl license.

Any nonresident licenses in excess of the first four thousand nonresident licenses in any year may only be used from November first through the end of the hunting season. However, the number of licenses to be issued in excess of four thousand annually shall be limited by the amount of money expended annually from the land acquisition and development fund dedicated for acquiring waterfowl hunting public access. Pursuant to the criteria and procedures contained in rules to be promulgated by the Game, Fish and Parks Commission pursuant to chapter 1-26, the number of nonresident waterfowl licenses to be issued annually in excess of four thousand shall be in a direct ratio of one license for each nonresident license fee amount that is expended during that calendar year by the department from the land acquisition and development fund to provide waterfowl hunting public access during that calendar year. The Game, Fish and Parks Commission shall promulgate rules pursuant to chapter 1-26 to implement the provisions of this section. Section 2. That chapter 41-6 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: No person may organize or participate in a guided commercial hunting activity, as defined by rules promulgated by the Game, Fish and Parks Commission pursuant to chapter 1-26, on lands owned, leased, controlled, managed, or otherwise acquired by the state for wildlife management, public hunting, or recreation purposes.
