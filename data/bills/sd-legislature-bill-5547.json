BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 25-2-9 be repealed. 25-2-9. No estate is allowed the husband as tenant by curtesy, upon the death of his wife, nor any estate in dower allotted to the wife upon the death of her husband. Section 2. That \u00a7 25-4-29 be repealed. 25-4-29. A divorce must be denied when there is an unreasonable lapse of time before the commencement of the action. Unreasonable lapse of time is such a delay in commencing the action as establishes the presumption that there has been connivance, collusion, or condonation of the offense, or full acquiescence in the same, with intent to continue the marriage relation, notwithstanding the commission of the offense set up as a ground of divorce. The presumption arising from lapse of time may be rebutted by showing reasonable grounds for the delay in commencing the action. There are no limitations of time for commencing actions for divorce, except such as contained in this section. Section 3. That \u00a7 25-4-48 be repealed. 25-4-48. When a divorce is granted for the adultery of the wife, the legitimacy of children begotten of her before the commission of the adultery is not affected; but the legitimacy of other children of the wife may be determined by the court upon the evidence in the case. In every such case all children begotten before the commencement of the action are to be presumed legitimate until the contrary is shown. Section 4. That \u00a7 25-4-49 be repealed. 25-4-49. When a divorce is granted for the adultery of the husband, the legitimacy of children of the marriage, begotten of the wife before the commencement of the action, is not affected. Section 5. That \u00a7 25-8-31 be repealed. 25-8-31. The judgment of the court of another state rendered in proceedings to compel support of a child born out of wedlock, and directing payment either of a fixed sum or of sums payable from time to time, may be sued upon in this state and be made a domestic judgment so far as not inconsistent with the laws of this state, and the same remedies may thereupon be had upon such judgment as if it had been recovered originally in this state."}, {"bill_id": 5547, "bill_version_id": 31628, "bill_version": "Enrolled", "bill_version_date": "2014-03-06T08:32:29.667-06:00", "bill_text": ""}], "amendments":
