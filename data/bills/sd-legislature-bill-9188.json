For purposes of calculating the one-year limitation period, each day that the violation persists, and each day that a policy in violation of this section remains in effect, constitutes a new violation of this section and, therefore, a new day that the cause of action has accrued."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 9188, "action_date": "2018-02-01T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 48504, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/48504.pdf", "status_text": "First read in Senate and referred to", "journal_page": 327, "committee_id_action": 395, "committee_id_assigned": 370, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 9188, "action_date": "2018-02-22T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 49430, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/49430.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 370, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 9188, "action_date": "2018-02-22T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 49679, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/49679.pdf", "status_text": "Motion to amend", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 370, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 9188, "action_date": "2018-02-22T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 49679, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/49679.pdf", "status_text": "Motion to amend", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 370, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 9188, "action_date": "2018-02-22T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 49679, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/49679.pdf", "status_text": "Motion to amend", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 370, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 9188, "action_date": "2018-02-22T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 49679, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/49679.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass Amended", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 370, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "F", "vote": {"vote_id": 26216, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [1262, 1245, 1271, 1230], "Yea": [1234, 1278, 1267]}}, {"bill_id": 9188, "action_date": "2018-02-22T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 49679, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/49679.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to the 41st legislative day", "journal_page": 548, "committee_id_action": 370, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 26217, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [1262, 1245, 1271, 1230], "Nay": [1234, 1278, 1267]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/9188"}
