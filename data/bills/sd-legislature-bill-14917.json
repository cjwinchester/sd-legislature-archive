WHEREAS, the less developed countries in Latin America, Asia, and Africa owe some $2.3 trillion to other governments and international financial institutions funded by them and acting on their behalf; and WHEREAS, the forty most heavily indebted poor countries of the world, as identified by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund owe less than one-tenth of the total--about $220 billion to foreign countries; and WHEREAS, it is estimated that these heavily indebted poor countries only owe the United States government approximately $2.9 billion directly in bilateral debt; and WHEREAS, the pressure on the poorest countries to continue paying the accumulated debt of decades is requiring a level of human sacrifice that is morally unacceptable and economically unjust and damaging to the environment because countries are required to shift resources from the safety, health, education, and welfare and development programs of their citizens under this pressure to meet debt payments to wealthier nations; and WHEREAS, policy initiatives by the United States government and others can ease the burden of debt and make an immediate and positive impact on vulnerable humans and their well-being in the most impoverished indebted countries; and WHEREAS, the reality is that a significant amount of the debt of the poorest countries will not and cannot ever be paid and their debt loads are unsustainable and this indebtedness creates a cycle of even more debt because new loans are extended to these poor countries for debt service to cover payments on interest without making any progress on repaying original loans; and WHEREAS, it would benefit the United States government and its taxpayers to relieve debt with policies that increasingly seek a more global economy based on open markets and free trade which also protects the incomes, education, and health of American citizens; and WHEREAS, there is a growing movement in congregations, schools, communities, and neighborhoods across the United States to circulate a worldwide petition to obtain twenty-one million signatures urging the cancellation of debt for the world's poorest countries; and WHEREAS, more than forty United States religious and secular groups and denominations have joined together thus far in this movement known as Jubilee 2000/USA as a building force for change and belief that the state of the new millennium should be a time to give effective help to people living in poverty; and WHEREAS, there are themes specifically calling for debt relief that are drawn from Jewish, Christian, Muslim, and other faith traditions; and WHEREAS, the purpose of debt relief is not to make life easier with debt relief for governments, but to make life better for people who are suffering: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the Senate of the Seventy-fourth Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the House of Representatives concurring therein, that the Congress of the United States pass legislation directing the United States government to write off the debt of approximately $2.9 billion in bilateral debt owed directly to the United States government by the poorest countries; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Legislature of the State of South Dakota encourages the President of the United States and his administration to call on other creditors and governments to adopt a similar policy for debt reduction and also calls on the President and his administration to use its weight and influence in the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and other international institutions to reduce dramatically the multilateral debt of the poorest countries with relief spread over a few years to be barely noticeable, particularly in this time of budget surpluses; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that the Legislature of the State of South Dakota further encourages both the Congress and the President of the United States to require that four conditions be met from countries scheduled for debt relief: democratization, respect for human rights, military reduction, and a commitment to use the money from debt relief for the needs of ordinary people."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 14917, "action_date": "1999-03-01T08:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 81971, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/81971.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 623, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 14917, "action_date": "1999-03-01T08:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 81971, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/81971.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass,", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 623, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "F", "vote": {"vote_id": 42164, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [2208, 2228, 2245, 2247, 2257, 2282, 2287, 2266, 2214], "Yea": [2232, 2240, 2254, 2262]}}, {"bill_id": 14917, "action_date": "1999-03-01T08:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 81971, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/81971.pdf", "status_text": "Tabled", "journal_page": 838, "committee_id_action": 623, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 42165, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [2208, 2228, 2245, 2247, 2257, 2282, 2287, 2266, 2214], "Nay": [2232, 2240, 2254, 2262]}}]}
