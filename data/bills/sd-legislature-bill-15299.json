The district of residence prior to the custodial transfer may not include students who meet these criteria in its general enrollment average daily membership after the student ceases to attend school in the resident district; (2) \"Adjusted average daily membership,\" calculated as follows: (a) For districts with a general enrollment average daily membership of two hundred or less, multiply 1.2 times the general enrollment average daily membership; (b) For districts with a general enrollment average daily membership of less than six hundred, but greater than two hundred, raise the general enrollment average daily membership to the 0.8293 power and multiply the result times 2.98; (c) For districts with a general enrollment average daily membership of six hundred or more, multiply 1.0 times their general enrollment average daily membership; (3) \"Index factor,\" is the annual percentage change in the consumer price index for urban wage earners and clerical workers as computed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States Department of Labor for the year before the year immediately preceding the year of adjustment or three percent, whichever is less; (4) \"Per student allocation,\" for the period January 1, 1997, to June 30, 1997, inclusive, is $1,675. For school fiscal year 1998 2001 , beginning on July 1, 1997 2000 , the per student allocation shall be $3,350 increased by the index factor $3,734 . Each school fiscal year thereafter, the per student allocation shall be the previous fiscal year's per student allocation increased by the index factor; (5) \"Local need,\" the per student allocation multiplied by the adjusted average daily membership; (6) \"Local effort,\" the amount of ad valorem taxes generated in a school fiscal year by applying the levies established pursuant to \u00a7 10-12-42. Section 3. Each school district shall use any funds that it may receive as a result of the increase in the per student allocation as provided in this Act to increase salaries of personnel employed by the school district. Section 4.

For the state aid to education distribution for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2002, a school district's entitlement for state aid provided for in this chapter shall be reduced by the amount by which the school district's ending general fund balance exceeds seventy-five percent of its general fund expenditures or two hundred fifty thousand dollars, whichever is greater, for the school fiscal year prior to the school fiscal year for which state aid to education is to be distributed. For the state aid to education distribution for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2003, a school district's entitlement for state aid provided for in this chapter shall be reduced by the amount by which the school district's ending general fund balance exceeds fifty percent of its general fund expenditures or two hundred fifty thousand dollars, whichever is greater, for the school fiscal year prior to the school fiscal year for which state aid to education is to be distributed. For the state aid to education distribution for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2004 and thereafter, a school district's entitlement for state aid provided for in this chapter shall be reduced by the amount by which the school district's ending general fund balance exceeds thirty percent of its general fund expenditures or two hundred fifty thousand dollars, whichever is greater, for the school fiscal year prior to the school fiscal year for which state aid to education is to be distributed. Section 6. Any money that is reduced from a school district's entitlement as provided by this Act shall be deposited into the education improvement fund which is hereby created as a special fund in the state treasury. The expenditure of any money out of the education improvement fund requires specific approval through an enactment of the Legislature. The Legislature may appropriate money out of the education improvement fund for purposes deemed by the Legislature to improve the overall quality of elementary and secondary education in South Dakota. Section 7. That chapter 4-8A be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: No money appropriated for general state aid to education that is in excess of the amount required to provide each school district its entitlement that results from errors in the estimates of average daily membership or of assessed valuations may be transferred out of the state aid to general education program. Such money shall revert to the general fund at the end of the fiscal year and notwithstanding \u00a7 4-7-32 or 4-7-39, such money may not be transferred to the budget reserve fund or to the property tax reduction fund. Section 8. The Department of Education and Cultural Affairs may promulgate rules pursuant to chapter 1-26 to define general fund balances for the purposes for which the term is used in this Act.
