The causal connection is satisfied if the injury is fairly traceable to the challenged action, and not the result of the independent action of any third party not before the court; (3) Shows it is likely, and not merely speculative, that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision, and; (4) Shows that the injury is unique or different from those injuries suffered by the public in general. Section 2. That \u00a7 11-2-17.3 be AMENDED: 11-2-17.3. Conditional use of real property--Ordinance--Content--Approval or disapproval of request. A county zoning ordinance adopted pursuant to under this chapter that authorizes a conditional use of real property shall specify the approving authority, each category of conditional use requiring such approval, the zoning districts in which a conditional use is available, the criteria for evaluating each conditional use, and any procedures for certifying approval of certain conditional uses. The approving authority shall consider the stated criteria, the objectives of the comprehensive plan, and the purpose of the zoning ordinance and its the relevant zoning districts when making a decision to approve or disapprove a conditional use request.

If the conditional use permit is granted, the conditional use shall be considered a lawful use, lot, or occupancy of land or premises and may be continued even though the use, lot, or occupation does not conform to the provisions of the ordinance.
