Section 2. Each health care provider that furnishes services in the treatment of or in connection with an injury not covered by the Workers' Compensation Act, if the injured party asserts or maintains a claim against another for damages on account of the injury, has a lien upon that part going or belonging to the injured party of any recovery or sum had or collected or to be collected by the injured party, or by the injured party's heir or personal representative in case of the injured party's death, whether by judgment or by settlement or compromise to the amount of the reasonable and necessary charges of the health care provider for the treatment, care, and maintenance of the injured party up to the date of payment of the damages. Section 3. The lien granted by this Act may not in any way prejudice or interfere with any lien or contract that may be made by such injured party or any heir or personal representative of the injured party with any attorney for handling the claim on behalf of the injured party, any heir, or personal representative.

The lien set forth in section 2 of this Act may not be applied or considered valid against anyone coming under the Workers' Compensation Act in this state. Section 6. No lien created by this Act is effective, however, unless a written notice containing the name and address of the injured party, the date of occurrence of the injury, the name and address of the health care provider, and the name of the person alleged to be liable to the injured party for the injuries received, is filed together with the post office receipt for such mailing in the office of the register of deeds of the county in which the health care services were provided, before the payment of any moneys to the injured party or the attorney or the legal representative of the injured party, as compensation for the injury.

The register of deeds shall make a proper index of the claim in the name of the injured person and shall charge a fee in accordance with subdivision 7-9-15(3). Section 8. The health care provider shall also mail by certified mail, postage prepaid, a copy of the notice required by section 6 of this Act with a statement of the date of filing of the notice to the person alleged to be liable to the injured party for the injury sustained before the payment of any moneys to the injured party or the attorney or the legal representative of the injured party as compensation for the injury. Section 9. The health care provider shall mail by certified mail, postage prepaid, a copy of the notice required by section 6 of this Act to any insurance carrier that has insured the person alleged to be liable against such liability.
