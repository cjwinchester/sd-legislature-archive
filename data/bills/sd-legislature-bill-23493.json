The league is an outspoken advocate for fish and wildlife, and ethical hunting and angling. The league supports habitat conservation and restoration with fees from hunters, anglers, and recreational shooters; and WHEREAS, the South Dakota Division of the Izaak Walton League of America has been a crucial partner in the Izaak Walton League of America's success. Six South Dakotans have served as national president, with four in the last twenty years. South Dakota members have strengthened the Izaak Walton League of America at all levels.
