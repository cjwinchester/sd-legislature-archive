Section 2. No resident or nonresident district is required to grant a request for a transfer that results in more than a two percent reduction or increase in average daily membership over the previous year. However, any such district at its discretion may elect to exceed the two percent limit. In determining whether to accept or reject a request for a transfer in or out of the district that causes the two-percent limit to be exceeded, the district shall rely on criteria established by the district pursuant to section 4 of this Act. Additionally, no district is required to approve a transfer request for a student enrolled in a special education program if the cost of providing that program in the receiving district would exceed the cost of offering the program in the district of residence, unless the additional cost of providing the program in the receiving district is paid by the parent or guardian of the transfer student.

If accepted, an application to enroll in the nonresident district obligates the student to attend the nonresident district, unless the school boards of the resident and the nonresident districts agree in writing to allow the student to transfer back to the resident district, or the student's parent or guardian changes residence to another district. Once enrolled in a nonresident district, the student may remain enrolled and is not required to resubmit annual applications. Section 4.

BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That chapter 13-28 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: An enrollment options program is established to enable any South Dakota kindergarten through twelfth grade student to attend a public school in a South Dakota school district in which the student does not reside, subject to the provisions in this Act. Any student who is enrolled, pursuant to this Act, in a district in which the student does not reside is not subject to the tuition requirements of \u00a7 13-28-22. For purposes of determining state aid to education as it relates to the provisions of this Act, general enrollment average daily membership as defined in section 10 of this Act is used to compute foundation aid and resident average daily membership as defined in section 12 of this Act is used to determine funding for special education. Section 2. That chapter 13-28 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: A school district is not required to grant a request for a transfer into the district if the transfer would result in an inability to provide a quality educational program based on criteria established by the district pursuant to section 5 of this Act. Section 3. That chapter 13-28 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: The resident district is responsible for the provision of a free appropriate public education for students in need of special education or special education and related services. A request to transfer a student in need of special education or special education and related services may be granted only if, through the placement committee process, the resident and nonresident districts determine that the nonresident district can provide an appropriate instructional program and facilities to meet the student's needs. The resident district shall reimburse the nonresident district actual costs incurred in providing an appropriate special education for a student in need of special education and related services. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 6 of this Act, the placement committee, including representatives of the resident and nonresident districts, shall determine whether a student in need of special education requires transportation as a related service. If so, the resident district shall provide or ensure the provision of transportation. If a parent or guardian of a student in need of special education or special education and related services wishes to transfer the student back to the resident district, the request shall be considered by the placement committee. The committee must include representatives of the resident and nonresident districts. Section 4. That chapter 13-28 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: A student's parent or legal guardian who wishes to enroll the student, or an emancipated student who wishes to enroll, in a South Dakota school district other than the resident district under the provisions of this Act shall, not later than February first of the school year preceding the year of enrollment, apply to the school boards of the resident district and nonresident district, on triplicate forms provided by the Department of Education and Cultural Affairs, to enroll the student in a district other than the resident district. By March first, the school board of the nonresident district in which the student wants to enroll shall approve or disapprove the application. The board of the nonresident district shall notify the applicant and the resident board of its decision within five days of the decision. The nonresident district shall review the applications in the order received. An application may be withdrawn by the applicant any time before March first upon notification of both school boards. Once approved by the nonresident board, the approved application serves as the applicant's notice of intent to enroll in the nonresident district during the next school year and obligates the student to attend school in the nonresident district during the next school year, unless the school boards of the resident and nonresident districts agree in writing to allow the student to transfer back to the resident district, or unless the parents, guardians, or emancipated student change residence to another district. If a student's parents, or an emancipated student, move from a resident district into another district after February first, the parents or emancipated student may apply for enrollment in a nonresident district under provisions of this Act. In such a case, the school boards of both the new resident district and the nonresident district shall waive the application and approval dates outlined in this Act, and the nonresident district board shall review the application in a timely manner as outlined above. The applicant shall be informed of the nonresident board's decision within five days of the board's action on the application. Once enrolled in a nonresident district, the student may remain enrolled and is not required to resubmit annual applications. Section 5. That chapter 13-28 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Each school district by November 1, 1997 shall by resolution adopt relevant standards for the acceptance and rejection of an application to enroll in the district under the provisions of this Act.

If two or more children from a family residing in the same household must enroll in different school districts as the result of a board's denial of an application to transfer from a resident district or to enroll in a nonresident district under the provisions of this Act, neither the resident board nor the nonresident board may deny the application. The decision of a local school board regarding a student's application for open enrollment or a request to return to the resident district under the provisions of this Act is subject to de novo appeal under the provisions of chapter 13-46. The Department of Education and Cultural Affairs may promulgate rules pursuant to chapter 1-26 specifying procedural and administrative requirements for the implementation of the open enrollment program and related transfers and enrollments under the provisions of this Act.

BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That chapter 13-28 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: An enrollment options program is established to enable any South Dakota kindergarten through twelfth grade student to attend a public school in a South Dakota school, subject to the provisions in this Act. Any student who is enrolled, pursuant to this Act, in a district in which the student does not reside is not subject to the tuition requirements of \u00a7 13-28-22. For purposes of determining state aid to education as it relates to the provisions of this Act, general enrollment average daily membership as defined in section 10 of this Act is used to compute foundation aid and resident average daily membership as defined in section 12 of this Act is used to determine funding for special education. Section 2. That chapter 13-28 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: A school district is not required to grant a request for a transfer into the district if the transfer would result in an inability to provide a quality educational program based on criteria established by the district pursuant to section 5 of this Act. Section 3. That chapter 13-28 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: The resident district is responsible for the provision of a free appropriate public education for students in need of special education or special education and related services. A request to transfer a student in need of special education or special education and related services may be granted only if, through the placement committee process, the resident and nonresident districts determine that the nonresident district can provide an appropriate instructional program and facilities to meet the student's needs. The resident district shall reimburse the nonresident district actual costs incurred in providing an appropriate special education for a student in need of special education and related services. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 6 of this Act, the placement committee, including representatives of the resident and nonresident districts, shall determine whether a student in need of special education requires transportation as a related service. If so, the resident district shall provide or ensure the provision of transportation. If a parent or guardian of a student in need of special education or special education and related services wishes to transfer the student back to the resident district, the request shall be considered by the placement committee. The committee must include representatives of the resident and nonresident districts. Section 4. That chapter 13-28 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: A student's parent or legal guardian who wishes to enroll the student, or an emancipated student who wishes to enroll, in a South Dakota school district other than the resident district under the provisions of this Act shall, not later than February first of the school year preceding the year of enrollment, apply to the school boards of the resident district and nonresident district, on triplicate forms provided by the Department of Education and Cultural Affairs, to enroll the student in a district other than the resident district. By March first, the school board of the nonresident district in which the student wants to enroll shall approve or disapprove the application. The board of the nonresident district shall notify the applicant and the resident board of its decision within five days of the decision. The nonresident district shall review the applications in the order received. An application may be withdrawn by the applicant any time before March first upon notification of both school boards. Once approved by the nonresident board, the approved application serves as the applicant's notice of intent to enroll in the nonresident district during the next school year and obligates the student to attend school in the nonresident district during the next school year, unless the school boards of the resident and nonresident districts agree in writing to allow the student to transfer back to the resident district, or unless the parents, guardians, or emancipated student change residence to another district. If a student's parents, or an emancipated student, move from a resident district into another district after February first, the parents or emancipated student may apply for enrollment in a nonresident district under provisions of this Act. In such a case, the school boards of both the new resident district and the nonresident district shall waive the application and approval dates outlined in this Act, and the nonresident district board shall review the application in a timely manner as outlined above. The applicant shall be informed of the nonresident board's decision within five days of the board's action on the application. Once enrolled in a nonresident district, the student may remain enrolled and is not required to resubmit annual applications. Section 5. That chapter 13-28 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Each school district by November 1, 1997 shall by resolution adopt relevant standards for the acceptance and rejection of an application to enroll in the district under the provisions of this Act. The board shall adopt standards through official board action, set them forth in writing, and make them available to any individual upon receiving an oral or written request. Standards may define the capacity of a program, class, grade level, and school building operated by the board and the pupil/teacher ratio. Discrimination based on race, gender, religious affiliation, or disability is prohibited. If two or more children from a family residing in the same household must enroll in different school districts as the result of a board's denial of an application to transfer from a resident district or to enroll in a nonresident district under the provisions of this Act, neither the resident board nor the nonresident board may deny the application. The decision of a local school board regarding a student's application for open enrollment or a request to return to the resident district under the provisions of this Act is subject to de novo appeal under the provisions of chapter 13-46. The Department of Education and Cultural Affairs may promulgate rules pursuant to chapter 1-26 specifying procedural and administrative requirements for the implementation of the open enrollment program and related transfers and enrollments under the provisions of this Act. Section 6. That chapter 13-28 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: The parent or guardian of a student who has been accepted for transfer is responsible for transporting the student to school in the receiving district without reimbursement. Either the district of residence or the receiving district may provide transportation to students approved for transfer. Section 7. That chapter 13-28 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: A school district shall accept credits for any course completed in any other accredited school district as the result of a transfer under this Act.

That chapter 13-28 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: A school district shall grant a request for a transfer into the district or within the district unless the transfer would result in an inability to provide a quality educational program based on criteria established by the district pursuant to section 5 of this Act. Section 3. That chapter 13-28 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: The resident district is responsible for the provision of a free appropriate public education for students in need of special education or special education and related services. A request to transfer a student in need of special education or special education and related services may be granted only if, through the placement committee process, the resident and nonresident districts determine that the nonresident district can provide an appropriate instructional program and facilities to meet the student's needs. The resident district shall reimburse the nonresident district actual costs incurred in providing an appropriate special education for a student in need of special education and related services. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 6 of this Act, the placement committee, including representatives of the resident and nonresident districts, shall determine whether a student in need of special education requires transportation as a related service. If so, the resident district shall provide or ensure the provision of transportation. If a parent or guardian of a student in need of special education or special education and related services wishes to transfer the student back to the resident district, the request shall be considered by the placement committee. The committee must include representatives of the resident and nonresident districts. Section 4. That chapter 13-28 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: A student's parent or legal guardian who wishes to enroll the student, or an emancipated student who wishes to enroll, under the provisions of this Act, in a South Dakota school district other than the resident district or in a school within the resident district other than the school to which the student has been assigned shall, not later than February first of the school year preceding the year of enrollment, apply to the affected school boards, on triplicate forms provided by the Department of Education and Cultural Affairs, to enroll the student in a district other than the resident district or to transfer within the district. By March first, the school board of the district in which the student desires to enroll shall approve or disapprove the application. The board shall notify the applicant and the resident board, if applicable, of its decision within five days of the decision. The district in which the student desires to enroll shall review the applications in the order received. However, intradistrict transfer applications may be accepted and acted upon at any time at the board's discretion if the policies on which the transfer decisions are based are consistent with the other requirements of this Act. An application may be withdrawn by the applicant any time before March first upon notification of all affected school boards. Once approved by the district in which the student wishes to enroll, the approved application serves as the applicant's notice of intent to enroll in the nonresident district or desired school during the next school year and obligates the student to attend school in the nonresident district or desired school during the next school year, unless the affected school board or boards agree in writing to allow the student to transfer back to the resident district or assigned school, or unless the parents, guardians, or emancipated student change residence to another district. If a student's parents, or an emancipated student, move from a resident district into another district after February first, the parents or emancipated student may apply for enrollment in a nonresident district or in a nonassigned school under provisions of this Act. In such a case, the school boards of both the new resident district and the nonresident district shall waive the application and approval dates outlined in this Act, and the affected board shall review the application in a timely manner as outlined above. The applicant shall be informed of the board's decision within five days of the board's action on the application. Once enrolled in a nonresident district or nonassigned school, the student may remain enrolled and is not required to resubmit annual applications. Section 5. That chapter 13-28 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Each school district by November 1, 1997 shall by resolution adopt relevant standards for the acceptance and rejection of an application to enroll in the district under the provisions of this Act. The board shall adopt standards through official board action, set them forth in writing, and make them available to any individual upon receiving an oral or written request. Standards may define the capacity of a program, class, grade level, and school building operated by the board and the pupil/teacher ratio. Discrimination based on race, gender, religious affiliation, or disability is prohibited. If two or more children from a family residing in the same household must enroll in different school districts as the result of a board's denial of an application to transfer from a resident district or to enroll in a nonresident district under the provisions of this Act, neither the resident board nor the nonresident board may deny the application. The decision of a local school board regarding a student's application for open enrollment or a request to return to the resident district under the provisions of this Act is subject to de novo appeal under the provisions of chapter 13-46. The Department of Education and Cultural Affairs may promulgate rules pursuant to chapter 1-26 specifying procedural and administrative requirements for the implementation of the open enrollment program and related transfers and enrollments under the provisions of this Act. Section 6. That chapter 13-28 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: The parent or guardian of a student who has been accepted for transfer is responsible for transporting the student to school in the receiving district without reimbursement. Either the district of residence or the receiving district may provide transportation to students approved for transfer. Section 7. That chapter 13-28 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: A school district shall accept credits for any course completed in any other accredited school district as the result of a transfer under this Act.
