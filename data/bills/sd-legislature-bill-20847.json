WHEREAS, President Bush's proposed FY 2007 budget proposes to eliminate funding for all Urban Indian Health programs; and WHEREAS, the Urban Indian Health Program was created as a result of the 1976 federal Indian Health Care Improvement Act, which explicitly recognized the special responsibility of the American people to provide the highest possible health status to Indians and urban Indians; and WHEREAS, the Urban Indian Health Program operates three full-time primary health care clinics in South Dakota in the cities of Sioux Falls, Aberdeen, and Pierre/Fort Pierre. These facilities are Federally Qualified Health Centers and State Medicaid Managed Care providers. South Dakota Urban Indian Health, Inc., was incorporated in South Dakota in 1977 as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit entity; and WHEREAS, South Dakota's Urban Indian Health clinics employ twenty-seven persons either directly or by contract and provided direct care service to more than 2,500 unduplicated enrolled members of federally recognized tribes in the last year; and WHEREAS, South Dakota's Urban Indian Health clinics provide primary medical care, diabetes care, community health services, substance abuse and mental health counseling, laboratory services, and pharmacy, dental, and optical services to South Dakota's urban Native American community; and WHEREAS, Urban Indian Health clinics provide a number of unique and important services. They are able to overcome cultural barriers experienced by many Native Americans who are reluctant to see health care providers who are unfamiliar with Native cultures, and they also play a role in educating other providers in the community to the unique needs and conditions of the urban Native American population. Urban Indian Health clinics enable patients to seek treatment before their health deteriorates further, they serve patients who might otherwise not seek any other medical care, and they are better able to address the health impacts of the movement of patients back and forth from reservations; and WHEREAS, Urban Indian Health clinics reduce costs to other, costlier parts of the Indian Health Service system by reducing their patient load; and WHEREAS, the proposed budget cut represents a loss of $33 million for the nation's 34 Urban Indian Health Programs, which would force many of these programs to close. South Dakota's Urban Indian Health Program would lose more than $1 million in overall funding; and WHEREAS, the elimination of the nation's Urban Indian Health Program would represent an irreparable loss of health services to the Native American community and would widen the already wide gap in health services available to Native American people: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the House of Representatives of the Eighty- first Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the Senate concurring therein, that the South Dakota Legislature urgently requests the United States Congress to fully restore the proposed Fiscal Year 2007 funding cuts to the Urban Indian Health Program so that the already limited health care options for Native American citizens are not further eroded; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that Congress is urged to increase the Fiscal Year 2007 budget for Urban Indian Health Programs nationwide by $12 million."}, {"bill_id": 20847, "bill_version_id": 109394, "bill_version": "Enrolled", "bill_version_date": "2006-02-24T14:31:47-06:00", "bill_text": ""}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 20847, "action_date": "2006-02-22T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 109233, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/109233.pdf", "status_text": "Introduced", "journal_page": 675, "committee_id_action": 893, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 20847, "action_date": "2006-02-23T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 109342, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/109342.pdf", "status_text": "Adopt Resolution", "journal_page": 695, "committee_id_action": 893, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 64597, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [3366, 3367, 3369, 3370, 3371, 3372, 3373, 3375, 3378, 3380, 3381, 3382, 3383, 3385, 3386, 3387, 3388, 3389, 3392, 3393, 3394, 3395, 3398, 3399, 3400, 3402, 3405, 3406, 3407, 3408, 3410, 3414, 3418, 3419, 3420, 3422, 3424, 3427, 3429, 3431, 3433, 3434, 3436, 3437, 3438, 3441, 3442, 3443, 3444, 3445, 3446, 3448, 3449, 3451, 3454, 3455, 3457, 3459, 3460, 3461, 3462, 3463, 3464, 3465, 3426], "Excused": [3401, 3440], "Nay": [3403, 3417, 3456]}}, {"bill_id": 20847, "action_date": "2006-02-24T08:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 109405, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/109405.pdf", "status_text": "Introduced", "journal_page": 680, "committee_id_action": 894, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 20847, "action_date": "2006-02-24T08:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 109405, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/109405.pdf", "status_text": "Concur In resolution", "journal_page": 684, "committee_id_action": 894, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 63187, "president_vote": null, "Excused": [3361, 3450, 3453], "Yea": [3362, 3364, 3365, 3368, 3374, 3376, 3377, 3384, 3390, 3391, 3396, 3397, 3404, 3411, 3412, 3413, 3415, 3416, 3421, 3423, 3425, 3428, 3430, 3432, 3435, 3439, 3447, 3452, 3458], "Nay": [3363, 3379, 3409]}}]}
