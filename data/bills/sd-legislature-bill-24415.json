Be it enacted by the Legislature of the State of South Dakota: Section 1. That \u00a7 10-4-40 be AMENDED: 10-4-40. One Two hundred fifty thousand dollars of the full and true value of the total amount of a dwelling or portion thereof classified as owner-occupied pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 10-13-39 to 10-13-40.4, inclusive, that is owned and occupied by a veteran who is rated as permanently and totally disabled from a service-connected disability is exempt from property taxation. The veteran shall apply for this partial exemption on a form prescribed by the secretary of revenue. Any application or supporting document for this exemption is confidential. Any veteran who would otherwise qualify for this exemption but fails to comply with the application deadline for the owner-occupied classification or the deadline for application for this exemption may petition the board of county commissioners to recalculate the taxes based upon the owner-occupied classification and this exemption and abate or refund the difference in taxes pursuant to chapter 10-18. Beginning on January 1, 2025, the total amount of full and true value exempt under this section increases annually by the index factor. The index factor is the annual percentage change in the consumer price index for urban wage earners and clerical workers as computed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States Department of Labor during the prior year. If the director of equalization determines that the veteran receives an exemption for the veteran's dwelling pursuant to this section, the veteran retains that exemption until such time as the property ownership is transferred, the veteran does not occupy the dwelling, or the property has a change in use. If the legal description of property is changed or amended and the veteran continues to reside in the dwelling, the veteran retains the exemption provided by this section. Section 2. That \u00a7 10-4-41 be AMENDED: 10-4-41. One Two hundred fifty thousand dollars of the full and true value of the total amount of a dwelling, or portion thereof, classified as owner-occupied pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 10-13-39 to 10-13-40.4, inclusive, is exempt from property taxation if owned and occupied by: (1) The surviving spouse of a veteran who was rated as permanently and totally disabled from a service-connected disability; or (2) The surviving spouse of a veteran, who receives dependency and indemnity compensation from the United States Department of Veterans Affairs as a result of the veteran's service-connected death.
