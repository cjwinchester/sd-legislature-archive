Section 3. The Department of Revenue is authorized and directed to enter into the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement with one or more states to simplify and modernize sales and use tax administration in order to substantially reduce the burden of tax compliance for all sellers and for all types of commerce. In furtherance of the agreement, the Department of Revenue is authorized to act jointly with other states that are members of the agreement to establish standards for certification of a certified service provider and certified automated system and establish performance standards for multistate sellers. The Department of Revenue is further authorized to take other actions reasonably required to implement the provisions set forth in this Act. Other actions authorized by this Act include, but are not limited to, the adoption of rules and regulations and the joint procurement, with other member states, of goods and services in furtherance of the cooperative agreement. The Department of Revenue or the department's designee is authorized to represent this state before the other states that are signatories to the agreement. Section 4. No provision of the agreement authorized by this Act in whole or part invalidates or amends any provision of the law of this state. Adoption of the agreement by this state does not amend or modify any law of this state. Implementation of any condition of the agreement in this state, whether adopted before, at, or after membership of this state in the agreement, must be by the action of this state. Section 5. The Department of Revenue shall not enter into the Streamlined Sales and Use Tax Agreement unless the agreement requires each state to abide by the following requirements: (a) The agreement must set restrictions to achieve over time more uniform state rates through the following: (1) Limiting the number of state rates. (2) Limiting the application of maximums on the amount of state tax that is due on a transaction. (3) Limiting the application of thresholds on the application of state tax. (b) The agreement must establish uniform standards for the following: (1) The sourcing of transactions to taxing jurisdictions. (2) The administration of exempt sales. (3) The allowances a seller may take for bad debts. (4) Sales and use tax returns and remittances.

(e) The agreement must provide that registration with the central registration system and the collection of sales and use taxes in the signatory states will not be used as a factor in determining whether the seller has nexus with a state for any tax. (f) The agreement must provide for reduction of the burdens of complying with local sales and use taxes through the following: (1) Restricting variances between the state and local tax bases. (2) Requiring states to administer any sales and use taxes levied by local jurisdictions within the state so that sellers collecting and remitting these taxes will not have to register or file returns with, remit funds to, or be subject to independent audits from local taxing jurisdictions.

(j) The agreement must require each state to certify compliance with the terms of the agreement prior to joining and to maintain compliance, under the laws of the member state, with all provision of the agreement while a member. (k) The agreement must require each state to adopt a uniform policy for certified service providers that protects the privacy of consumers and maintains the confidentiality of tax information. (l) The agreement must provide for the appointment of an advisory council of private sector representatives and an advisory council of nonmember state representatives to consult with in the administration of the agreement. Section 6. The agreement authorized by this Act is an accord among individual cooperating sovereigns in furtherance of their governmental functions. The agreement provides a mechanism among the member states to establish and maintain a cooperative, simplified system for the application and administration of sales and use taxes under the duly adopted law of each member state. Section 7. A certified service provider is the agent of a seller, with whom the certified service provider has contracted, for the collection and remittance of sales and use taxes. As the seller's agent, the certified service provider is liable for sales and use tax due each member state on all sales transactions it processes for the seller except as set out in this section. A seller that contracts with a certified service provider is not liable to the state for sales or use tax due on transactions processed by the certified service provider unless the seller misrepresented the type of items it sells or committed fraud. In the absence of probable cause to believe that the seller has committed fraud or made a material misrepresentation, the seller is not subject to audit on the transactions processed by the certified service provider. A seller is subject to audit for transactions not processed by the certified service provider. The member states acting jointly may perform a system check of the seller and review the seller's procedures to determine if the certified service provider's system is functioning properly and the extent to which the seller's transactions are being processed by the certified service provider. A person that provides a certified automated system is responsible for the proper functioning of that system and is liable to the state for underpayments of tax attributable to errors in the functioning of the certified automated system. A seller that uses a certified automated system remains responsible and is liable to the state for reporting and remitting tax. A seller that has a proprietary system for determining the amount of tax due on transactions and has signed an agreement establishing a performance standard for that system is liable for the failure of the system to meet the performance standard. Section 8. Sections 1 to 7, inclusive, of this Act shall be known as and referred to as the Uniform Sales and Use Tax Administration Act. Section 9. That \u00a7 10-1-44.1 be repealed. 10-1-44.1.

However, so long as a municipality has any bonds or other obligations outstanding which are secured directly or indirectly by the pledge or collection and application of sales taxes levied pursuant to chapter 10-52 as in effect immediately prior to January 1, 2006, no municipality may reduce its tax levy under chapter 10-52 to a rate which, in the exercise of the sound discretion of the governing body, would be expected to produce less total revenue than was collected in the immediately preceding year. Section 46. Sections 18, 19, 20, 21, 30, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 41, 42, and 44 are effective on January 1, 2006. Section 47. Except as may be required by section 45 of this Act, it is the intent of the Legislature that the provisions of this Act be revenue neutral to all levels of government. Any municipality that has reviewed its sales tax ordinance as required by section 37 of this Act shall determine and enact a rate of taxation that, in the exercise of the sound discretion of the governing body, would be expected to produce no more total revenue than was collected in the immediately preceding year. However, nothing herein shall prohibit any increase in revenues that are projected to occur because of economic growth. Section 48. Section 47 of this Act is repealed on January 1, 2007. Section 49. Whereas, this Act is necessary for the support of the state government and its existing public institutions, an emergency is hereby declared to exist, and sections 1 through 12 of this Act shall be in full force and effect from and after its passage and approval."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 16747, "action_date": "2002-01-08T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id":
