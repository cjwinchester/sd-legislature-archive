BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 13-13-10.1 be amended to read as follows: 13-13-10.1. Terms used in this chapter mean: (1) \"Average daily membership,\" the average number of resident and nonresident kindergarten through twelfth grade pupils enrolled in all schools operated by the school district during the previous regular school year, minus average number of pupils for whom the district receives tuition, except pupils described in subdivision (1A) and pupils for whom tuition is being paid pursuant to \u00a7 13-28-42.1 and plus the average number of pupils for whom the district pays tuition; (1A) Nonresident students who are in the care and custody of the Department of Social Services, the Unified Judicial System, the Department of Corrections, or other state agencies and are attending a public school may be included in the average daily membership of the receiving district when enrolled in the receiving district. When counting a student who meets these criteria in its general enrollment average daily membership, the receiving district may begin the enrollment on the first day of attendance. The district of residence prior to the custodial transfer may not include students who meet these criteria in its general enrollment average daily membership after the student ceases to attend school in the resident district; (2) \"Adjusted average daily membership,\" calculated as follows: (a) For districts with an average daily membership of two hundred or less, multiply 1.2 times the average daily membership; (b) For districts with an average daily membership of less than six hundred, but greater than two hundred, raise the average daily membership to the 0.8293 power and multiply the result times 2.98; (c) For districts with an average daily membership of six hundred or more, multiply 1.0 times their average daily membership; (2A) \"Fall enrollment,\" the number of kindergarten through twelfth grade students enrolled in all schools operated by the school district on the last Friday of September of the previous school year minus the number of students for whom the district receives tuition, except nonresident students who are in the care and custody of a state agency and are attending a public school and students for whom tuition is being paid pursuant to \u00a7 13-28-42.1, plus the number of students for whom the district pays tuition. When computing state aid to education for a school district under the foundation program pursuant to \u00a7 13-13-73, the secretary of the Department of Education shall use either the school district's fall enrollment or the average of the school district's fall enrollment and the school district's fall enrollment from the prior year, whichever is higher. However, if a school district qualifies to benefit from both the averaging permitted in this subdivision and the one-time payment provided in \u00a7 13-13-80 in the same fiscal year, the school district may not benefit from both, but only from the one that provides the most additional funding to the district; (2B) \"Current fall enrollment,\" the number of kindergarten through twelfth grade students enrolled in all schools operated by the school district on the last Friday of September of the current school year minus the number of students for whom the district receives tuition except nonresident students who are in the care and custody of a state agency and are attending a public school and students for whom tuition is being paid pursuant to \u00a7 13-28-42.1, plus the number of students for whom the district pays tuition; (2C) \"Small school adjustment,\" calculated as follows: (a) For districts with a fall enrollment of two hundred or less, multiply 0.2 times $4,237.72; (b) For districts with a fall enrollment of greater than two hundred, but less than six hundred, multiply the fall enrollment times negative 0.0005; add 0.3 to that result; and multiply the sum obtained times $4,237.72; (3) \"Index factor,\" is the annual percentage change in the consumer price index for urban wage earners and clerical workers as computed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States Department of Labor for the year before the year immediately preceding the year of adjustment or three percent, whichever is less; (4) \"Per student allocation,\" for school fiscal year 2009 is $4,664.66. Each school fiscal year thereafter, the per student allocation is the previous fiscal year's per student allocation increased by the index factor; (5) \"Local need,\" is the sum of: (a) The per student allocation multiplied by the fall enrollment; and (b) The small school adjustment, if applicable, multiplied by the fall enrollment; and (c) The payment distributed pursuant to \u00a7 13-13-80, if applicable; (6) \"Local effort,\" the amount of ad valorem taxes generated in a school fiscal year by applying the levies established pursuant to \u00a7 10-12-42; (7) \"General fund balance,\" the unreserved fund balance of the general fund, less general fund exclusions plus, beginning with transfers made in fiscal year 2001, any transfers out of the general fund for the previous school fiscal year; (8) \"General fund balance percentage,\" is a school district's general fund balance divided by the school district's total general fund expenditures for the previous school fiscal year, the quotient expressed as a percent; (9) \"General fund base percentage,\" is the lesser of: (a) The general fund balance percentage as of June 30, 2000; or (b) The maximum allowable percentage for that particular fiscal year as stated in this subsection. For fiscal year 2008, the maximum allowable percentage is one hundred percent; for fiscal year 2009, eighty percent; for fiscal year 2010, sixty percent; for fiscal year 2011, forty percent; for fiscal year 2012 and subsequent fiscal years, twenty-five percent. However, the general fund base percentage can never be less than twenty-five percent; (10) \"Allowable general fund balance,\" the general fund base percentage multiplied by the district's general fund expenditures in the previous school fiscal year; (11) \"General fund exclusions,\" revenue a school district has received from the imposition of the excess tax levy pursuant to \u00a7 10-12-43; revenue a school district has received from gifts, contributions, grants, or donations; revenue a school district has received under the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 13-6-92 to 13-6-96, inclusive; revenue a school district has received as compensation for being a sparse school district under the terms of \u00a7\u00a7 13-13-78 and 13-13-79; any revenue a school district has received under the provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (P.L. 111-5); and any revenue in the general fund set aside for a noninsurable judgment. Section 2. That \u00a7 13-13-80 be amended to read as follows: 13-13-80. If a school district's current fall enrollment, as defined in \u00a7 13-13-10.1, increases by at least five percent or by a minimum of twenty-five students over the fall enrollment, that school district shall receive a one-time payment equal to fifty percent of the per student allocation times the number of students by which the current fall enrollment exceeds the fall enrollment. The payment shall be made to the district prior to the first of December in the current school year. However, if a school district qualifies to benefit from both the averaging permitted in subdivision 13-13-10.1(2A) and the one-time payment pursuant to this section in the same fiscal year, the school district may not benefit from both, but only from the one that provides the most additional funding to the district."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 1950, "action_date": "2010-02-02T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 11655, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/11655.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 263, "committee_id_action": 86, "committee_id_assigned": 73, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 1950, "action_date": "2010-02-12T07:30:00-06:00", "document_id": 12059, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/12059.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 73, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 1950, "action_date": "2010-02-17T07:30:00-06:00", "document_id": 12218, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/12218.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 73, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 1950, "action_date": "2010-02-17T07:30:00-06:00", "document_id": 12413, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/12413.pdf", "status_text": "Tabled", "journal_page": 444, "committee_id_action": 73, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 6579, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [825, 793, 813, 817, 829, 757, 834, 783, 819, 841, 833, 763, 789, 828, 801]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/1950"}
