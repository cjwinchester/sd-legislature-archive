BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 3-9-1 be amended to read as follows: 3-9-1. The State Board of Finance, on or before the first of July each year, shall prescribe a rate per mile which shall be paid to those operating privately owned automobiles and vehicles on state business. If, for the prior fiscal year, the annual percentage change in the consumer price index for urban wage earners and clerical workers, as computed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States Department of Labor, is two percent or greater, the Board of Finance shall consider and vote upon a proposed rate per mile that exceeds the rate per mile prescribed for the current fiscal year by at least one cent. Any person using a privately owned automobile or motorcycle shall be reimbursed at the same rate per mile. However, if no state vehicle is equipped for the transportation of a person with special needs, a different rate per mile may be established. The rate may be changed during a fiscal year with the prior approval of the Legislative Interim Appropriations Committee. The state auditor shall issue warrants covering vehicle expenses at the rate specified by the State Board of Finance upon the sworn statement of the party using the vehicle."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 5241, "action_date": "2014-02-04T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 29776, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/29776.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 269, "committee_id_action": 231, "committee_id_assigned": 222, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 5241, "action_date": "2014-02-13T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 30181, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/30181.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 222, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 5241, "action_date": "2014-02-13T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 30382, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/30382.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to the 41st legislative day", "journal_page": 411, "committee_id_action": 222, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 16095, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [524, 487, 500, 510], "Yea": [509, 501, 520, 439, 468, 498, 518], "Excused": [499, 484]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/5241"}
