BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 36-4-17 be amended to read as follows: 36-4-17. The examination required by this chapter shall be in writing. The questions on all subjects shall be such as are answered alike by all schools of medicine or osteopathy. No license may be refused any applicant because of adherence to any particular school of medicine. Each applicant shall be required to attain an average percentage of at least seventy-five percent of correct answers. Any applicant failing on such examination is eligible for a maximum of two subsequent examinations upon payment of the required fee at any regular meeting of the Board of Medical and Osteopathic Examiners or at such time and place as the board may designate. Before taking the examination, the applicant shall pay to the secretary of the board a fee to be set by the board in an amount not to exceed five hundred fifty dollars. The applicant must pass all parts or steps of the examination within seven years. However, if the applicant is board-certified by a board of the American Board of Medical Specialties, the Board of Medical and Osteopathic Examiners may waive this requirement. The board may waive the requirements of this section for an applicant if the licensure of that applicant supports a healthcare need in the state that would otherwise not be met. All grades achieved shall be preserved by the secretary of the board for a period of at least three years."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 19904, "action_date": "2005-01-27T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 103467, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/103467.pdf", "status_text": "First read in Senate and referred to", "journal_page": 204, "committee_id_action": 861, "committee_id_assigned": 835, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 19904, "action_date": "2005-02-03T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 104002, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/104002.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 835, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 19904, "action_date": "2005-02-03T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 104002, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/104002.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass Amended,", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 835, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "D", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 19904, "action_date": "2005-02-03T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 104002, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/104002.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to 41st legislative day", "journal_page": 328, "committee_id_action": 835, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 61560, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [3150, 3198, 3202, 3241, 3157, 3212], "Excused": [3236]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/19904"}
