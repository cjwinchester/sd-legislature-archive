WHEREAS, hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe and can offer an inexhaustible supply of fuel, once released from water, biomass, or other hydrocarbons such as coal; and WHEREAS, South Dakota's economy and citizens would benefit significantly from the development of our state's potential to produce clean hydrogen from biomass such as ethanol and other agricultural products, wind-powered electrolysis of water, and coal gasification and storage of carbon dioxide in the soil and underground; and WHEREAS, businesses, states, and nations around the world are aggressively pursuing a hydrogen-powered economy and agree that hydrogen represents a promising and potentially pollution-free competitor to oil as a transportation fuel and will soon be a necessity in our economy as oil production decreases and becomes more expensive; and WHEREAS, hydrogen is widely seen as an attractive energy carrier throughout the economy if used in clean, efficient fuel cells to produce useful electricity, heating, and cooling; and WHEREAS, South Dakota's world class research institutions and universities can increase the overall investment in this region and accelerate the commercialization of hydrogen, fuel cells, and other clean energy technologies by integrating their strengths with those of similar institutions and states in the region; and WHEREAS, our stated goal in the United States is to be more energy-independent in today's world: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the Senate of the Eightieth Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the House of Representatives concurring therein, that it is the policy of the State of South Dakota to: (1) Develop its capacity to produce, store, distribute, and use hydrogen made from South Dakota resources as an increasing source of transportation fuel, electricity, and energy for heating and cooling and for fertilizer production and other commercially productive uses; (2) Encourage the commercialization of hydrogen, fuel cells, and other clean energy technologies that would benefit the state; and (3) Encourage South Dakota's research and higher education institutions to work with similar institutions in the region to explore the creation of a Regional Energy Research Consortium that can compete effectively for public and private investment with other national centers of excellence, such as the United States Department of Energy's recently established Hydrogen Technology Learning Centers."}, {"bill_id": 20037, "bill_version_id": 104946, "bill_version": "Enrolled", "bill_version_date": "2005-02-17T09:13:44-06:00", "bill_text": ""}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 20037, "action_date": "2005-02-11T13:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 104611, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/104611.pdf", "status_text": "Introduced", "journal_page": 448, "committee_id_action": 861, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 20037, "action_date": "2005-02-14T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 104707, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/104707.pdf", "status_text": "Adopt Resolution", "journal_page": 467, "committee_id_action": 861, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 60053, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [3150, 3151, 3152, 3153, 3154, 3157, 3163, 3166, 3168, 3173, 3179, 3180, 3185, 3186, 3193, 3198, 3200, 3201, 3202, 3204, 3205, 3210, 3212, 3214, 3217, 3221, 3224, 3228, 3236, 3239, 3241, 3242, 3247], "Excused": [3165, 3219]}}, {"bill_id": 20037, "action_date": "2005-02-15T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 104811, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/104811.pdf", "status_text": "Introduced", "journal_page": 483, "committee_id_action": 860, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 20037, "action_date": "2005-02-16T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 104927, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/104927.pdf", "status_text": "Concur In resolution", "journal_page": 512, "committee_id_action": 860, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 62023, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [3155, 3156, 3160, 3164, 3167, 3172, 3175, 3176, 3177, 3178, 3181, 3182, 3183, 3187, 3190, 3191, 3196, 3197, 3199, 3203, 3208, 3209, 3216, 3218, 3220, 3225, 3229, 3232, 3233, 3235, 3238, 3240, 3243, 3245, 3246, 3248, 3251, 3252, 3254], "Nay": [3158, 3159, 3161, 3162, 3170, 3171, 3174, 3184, 3188, 3189, 3192, 3194, 3195, 3206, 3207, 3211, 3213, 3222, 3223, 3227, 3230, 3231, 3234, 3237, 3244, 3249, 3253, 3255, 3215], "Excused": [3169, 3226]}}]}
