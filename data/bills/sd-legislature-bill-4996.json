Section 2. That chapter 58-33 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: No insurer may require the use of replacement crash parts in the repair of a motor vehicle unless the replacement crash part is at least of like kind and quality to the part being replaced in terms of fit, function, and finish. Replacement crash parts certified to meet the standards set by an American National Standards Institute recognized entity, including the Certified Automotive Parts Association, are presumed to be at least of like kind and quality to the part being replaced in terms of fit, function, and finish.
