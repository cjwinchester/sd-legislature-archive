BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 21-22-1 be amended to read: 21-22-1. Terms used in this chapter mean: (1) \"Beneficiary,\" any person beneficially interested in the trust, as defined in subdivision 55-1-24(1) or who has a direct financial interest in the trust, including a creditor or claimant with any rights or claimed rights against the trust estate if the creditor or claimant demonstrates a previously asserted specific claim against the trust estate; (2) \"Court trust,\" any trust which is established or confirmed by the judgment, decree, or order of any court of record of this state or any foreign jurisdiction, or one which is established or confirmed by a personal representative's instrument of distribution or a personal representative's deed of distribution; (3) \"Fiduciary,\" a trustee, custodian, enforcer, trust advisor, trust protector, or trust committee, as named in the governing instrument or order of court, regardless of whether such person is acting in a fiduciary or nonfiduciary capacity; (4) \"Other trust,\" any trust which is not a court trust; (5) \"Supervision,\" the supervision of the circuit court over the administration of a trust as provided in this chapter; (6) \"Trustee,\" the trustee or trustees of any trust which may be supervised under this chapter. Section 2. That \u00a7 55-1-20 be amended to read: 55-1-20. Subject to the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 55-1-21 and 55-1-22, a trust may be performed Subdivisions 55-1-4(2) and 55-1-5(2) notwithstanding, a purpose trust may be performed pursuant to this section and sections 3 to 20, inclusive, of this Act if the trust is for a specific lawful noncharitable purpose or for lawful noncharitable purposes to be selected by the trustee. Any property may form a part or all of the trust estate, including some, all, or an interest in some or all of the property that is the subject or purpose of a purpose trust. A governing instrument of such a trust shall be liberally construed in favor of its validity to presume against the merely precatory or honorary nature of the disposition and to carry out the trustor's intent. If necessary, extrinsic evidence is admissible to determine the trustor's intent. Neither the common law rule against perpetuities, nor any rule restricting the accumulation of income, nor any common law rule limiting the duration of noncharitable purpose trusts is in force in this state. Section 3. That \u00a7 55-1-21 be amended to read: 55-1-21. Subject to the provisions of \u00a7 55-1-22, a trust for the care of a designated animal is valid. The trust terminates when no living animal is covered by the trust. A governing instrument shall be liberally construed to bring the transfer within this section, to presume against the merely precatory or honorary nature of the disposition, and to carry out the general intent of the transferor. Extrinsic evidence is admissible in determining the transferor's intent. The following purpose trusts are valid: (1) A trust for the care of a designated animal or animals; (2) A trust for the care, maintenance, promotion, continuation, conservation, upkeep, protection, furtherance, or preservation of any other property; and (3) A trust for any other lawful noncharitable purpose or purposes. Section 4. That chapter 55-1 be amended by adding a NEW SECTION to read: Except as otherwise provided in the governing instrument, a trust described in \u00a7 55-1-21(1) terminates when no living animal is covered by the trust. Section 5. That chapter 55-1 be amended by adding a NEW SECTION to read: A court may reasonably reduce the amount of the property transferred to the trustee of a purpose trust if the court determines that the trust corpus substantially exceeds the amount required for the intended purposes. The court should consider allowing the trust to be administered for a reasonable period of time before undertaking a determination. The amount of the reduction, if any, passes as unexpended trust property, as set forth in section 11 of this Act. Section 6. That chapter 55-1 be amended by adding a NEW SECTION to read: If the court finds that the fulfillment of the purposes are or have become impossible, inexpedient, or unlawful, the court shall make an order directing that the trust be administered in such manner as, in the judgment of the court, will, as nearly as can be, accomplish the general purposes, the objects, and intentions of the trustor. Section 7. That chapter 55-1 be amended by adding a NEW SECTION to read: The purposes of a purpose trust may be enforced by an enforcer designated in the governing instrument and if no enforcer is acting pursuant to the terms of the governing instrument the court may appoint one or more enforcers and successor enforcers. No purpose trust may fail for want of an enforcer. An enforcer may petition for, consent to, waive, or object to any matter regarding a purpose trust with regard to the purpose of the trust which the enforcer represents or concerning the administration of the purpose trust. Enforcers are fiduciaries and, except as otherwise provided in the governing instrument, are entitled to reasonable compensation as determined by the trustee. An enforcer may also serve as a trust protector or a family advisor pursuant to chapter 55-1B. However, an enforcer may not serve as an enforcer while serving as a trustee or a distribution trust advisor of the same trust. Section 8. That chapter 55-1 be amended by adding a NEW SECTION to read: Any trustee may petition the court for the removal of an enforcer. An enforcer may be removed if the court finds: (1) The enforcer committed a serious breach of the purpose enforcer's responsibilities or is unfit or unwilling to serve; (2) A significant and unjustified lack of cooperation or hostility between the enforcer and the trustee, trust protector, or trust advisor; or (3) There has been a substantial change in circumstances and removal of the enforcer would best serve the purpose or purposes of the trust. The governing instrument may provide additional procedures for the removal of an enforcer. Section 9. That chapter 55-1 be amended by adding a NEW SECTION to read: Except as otherwise provided in the governing instrument, a trustee of a purpose trust is vested with full discretion in: (1) Interpreting the purposes of the trust consistent with the terms of the governing instrument; and (2) Applying, distributing, or expending principal and income to further the trust's purposes. Section 10. That chapter 55-1 be amended by adding a NEW SECTION to read: If no trustee is designated or no designated trustee is willing or able to serve, a court shall name a trustee. A court may order the transfer of the property to another trustee if required to ensure that the intended purposes are carried out or if no successor trustee is designated in the governing instrument or no designated successor trustee agrees to serve or is able to serve. A court may also make such other orders and determinations as are advisable to carry out the intent of the trustor and the purpose of sections 2 to 20, inclusive, of this Act. Section 11. That chapter 55-1 be amended by adding a NEW SECTION to read: Upon termination of a purpose trust, the trustee shall distribute any remaining trust property as directed in the governing instrument. Only in the event that the governing instrument is silent shall the trustee, upon termination of a purpose trust, distribute any remaining trust property as follows: (1) If the trust was created in a nonresiduary clause in a testator's will and the will fails to direct the distribution of unexpended trust property, then under the residuary clause of the testator's will, and for the purposes of \u00a7 29A-2-707, the residuary clause is treated as creating a future interest under the terms of a trust; and (2) Otherwise, to the trustor's heirs under \u00a7 29A-2-711. Section 12. That chapter 55-1 be amended by adding a NEW SECTION to read: Except as ordered by the court or required by the governing instrument, no filings, reports, periodic accounting, separate maintenance of funds, appointment, or registration of a purpose trust are required. Section 13. That chapter 55-1 be amended by adding a NEW SECTION to read: Except as expressly provided otherwise in the trust instrument, no portion of the principal or income may be converted to the use of the trustee or to any use other than for the trust's purposes or the benefit of a covered animal. Section 14. That \u00a7 55-1-22 be amended to read: 55-1-22. Any trust provided for by \u00a7\u00a7 55-1-20 and 55-1-21 is subject to the following provisions: (1) Except as expressly provided otherwise in the trust instrument, no portion of the principal or income may be converted to the use of the trustee or to any use other than for the trust's purposes or for the benefit of a covered animal; (2) Upon termination, the trustee shall transfer the unexpended trust property in the following order: (a) As directed in the trust instrument; (b) If the trust was created in a nonresiduary clause in the transferor's will or in a codicil to the transferor's will, then under the residuary clause in the transferor's will; and (c) If no beneficiary results from the application of subsection (a) or (b) of this subdivision, then to the transferor's heirs under \u00a7 29A-2-711; (3) For the purposes of \u00a7 29A-2-707, the residuary clause is treated as creating a future interest under the terms of a trust; (4) The intended use of the principal or income may be enforced by a person designated for that purpose in the trust instrument or, if none, by an individual appointed by a court upon application to it by that person; (5) Except as ordered by the court or required by the trust instrument, no filing, report, registration, periodic accounting, separate maintenance of funds, appointment, or fee is required by reason of the existence of the fiduciary relationship of the trustee; (6) A court may reasonably reduce the amount of the property transferred if it determines that that amount substantially exceeds the amount required for the intended use. The amount of the reduction, if any, passes as unexpended trust property under subdivision (2) of this section; (7) If no trustee is designated or no designated trustee is willing or able to serve, a court shall name a trustee. A court may order the transfer of the property to another trustee if required to ensure that the intended use is carried out and if no successor trustee is designated in the trust instrument or if no designated successor trustee agrees to serve or is able to serve. A court may also make such other orders and determinations as are advisable to carry out the intent of the transferor and the purpose of \u00a7\u00a7 55-1-20 to 55-1-22, inclusive. A hybrid purpose trust which meets the description of a purpose trust in sections 2 to 13, inclusive, of this Act also includes one or more beneficiaries is valid and may be performed. Section 15. That chapter 55-1 be amended by adding a NEW SECTION to read: In a hybrid purpose trust when the interests of the beneficiaries and purposes are concurrent, the trustee shall maintain not less than two separate shares, one for the beneficiaries; and a second for the purposes, and the trustee may be liable to the beneficiaries for the actual damages caused thereby, if any, for failing to do so. Section 16. That chapter 55-1 be amended by adding a NEW SECTION to read: The beneficiaries' share of a hybrid purpose trust is governed by \u00a7\u00a7 43-5-8 and 43-6-7. Section 17. That chapter 55-1 be amended by adding a NEW SECTION to read: A hybrid purpose trust may: (1) Contain a spendthrift provision; and (2) Also qualify as a trust described in \u00a7 55-16-2. Section 18. That chapter 55-1 be amended by adding a NEW SECTION to read: The provisions of sections 3 to 12, inclusive, of this Act apply to a hybrid purpose trust except that: (1) Under section 4 of this Act, except as otherwise provided in the governing instrument, a trust as described in subdivision (1) of section 3 of this Act terminates when no living animal is covered by the trust unless the trust may continue for the benefit of the beneficiaries; and (2) Under section 5 of this Act, a court has no power to reduce the amount of trust property intended for or allocated to any beneficiaries or any charitable purposes. Section 19. That chapter 55-1 be amended by adding a NEW SECTION to read: Except as otherwise provided in the governing instrument, a trustee of a hybrid purpose trust is vested with full discretion in administering the trust and considering the best interests of the beneficiaries and the purposes of the trust. Section 20. That chapter 55-1 be amended by adding a NEW SECTION to read: In addition to section 7 of this Act, an enforcer may also not be a beneficiary of a hybrid purpose trust. Section 21. That \u00a7 55-1-53 be amended to read: 55-1-53. The terms of a governing instrument may expand, restrict, eliminate, or otherwise vary any provisions of general application to trusts and trust administration. Nothing in this section allows the terms of the governing instrument to expand, restrict, eliminate, or otherwise vary the duties, restrictions, and liabilities imposed by the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 55-4-10 to 55-4-12, inclusive \u00a7\u00a7 55-4-11 and 55-4-12. Section 22. That \u00a7 55-1B-1 be amended to read: 55-1B-1. Terms used in this chapter mean: (1) \"Instrument,\" any revocable or irrevocable trust document created inter vivos or testamentary or any custodial account agreement whether such document or agreement was created prior to, on, or after July 1, 1997; (2) \"Trust protector,\" any person whose appointment as protector is provided for in the instrument. Such person may not be considered to be acting in a fiduciary capacity except to the extent the governing instrument provides otherwise. However, a protector shall be considered acting in a fiduciary capacity to the extent that the person exercises the authority of an investment trust advisor or a distribution trust advisor; (3) \"Trust advisor,\" either an investment trust advisor or a distribution trust advisor or, in the case of a custodial account, a custodial account owner or the owner's designee; (4) \"Fiduciary,\" a trustee or custodian under any instrument, an executor, administrator, or personal representative of a decedent's estate, or any other party, including a trust advisor, a trust protector, or a trust committee, who is acting in a fiduciary capacity for any person, trust, or estate; (5) \"Excluded fiduciary,\" any fiduciary excluded from exercising certain powers under the instrument which powers may be exercised by the grantor, custodial account owner, trust advisor, trust protector, trust committee, or other persons designated in the instrument; (6) \"Investment trust advisor,\" a fiduciary, given authority by the instrument to exercise all or any portions of the powers and discretions set forth in \u00a7 55-1B-10; (7) \"Distribution trust advisor,\" a fiduciary, given authority by the instrument to exercise all or any portions of the powers and discretions set forth in \u00a7 55-1B-11; (8) \"Custodial account,\" an account, established by a party with a bank as defined in 26 U.S.C. 408(n), as of January 1, 2006, or with another person approved by the Internal Revenue Service as satisfying the requirements to be a nonbank trustee or a nonbank passive trustee set forth in U.S. Treasury Regulations promulgated under 26 U.S.C. 408, that is governed by an instrument concerning the establishment or maintenance, or both, of an individual retirement account, qualified retirement plan, Archer medical savings account, health savings account, Coverdell education savings account, or any similar retirement or savings vehicle permitted under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as of January 1, 2006; (9) \"Custodial account owner,\" any party who establishes a custodial account; or has the power to designate the beneficiaries or appoint the custodian of the custodial account; or otherwise is the party who possesses the power to direct the investment, disposition, or retention of any assets in the custodial account or name an authorized designee to effect the same; (10) \"Family advisor,\" any person whose appointment is provided for in the governing instrument or by court order who is authorized to consult with or advise a fiduciary with regard to fiduciary or nonfiduciary matters and actions, and who may also be authorized by the governing instrument or court order to otherwise act in a nonfiduciary capacity. Section 23. That \u00a7 55-1B-2 be amended to read: 55-1B-2. An excluded fiduciary is not liable, either individually or as a fiduciary, for any of the following: (1) Any loss that results from compliance with a direction of the trust advisor, custodial account owner, or authorized designee of a custodial account owner, including any loss from the trust advisor breaching fiduciary responsibilities or acting beyond the trust advisor's scope of authority; (2) Any loss that results from a failure to take any action proposed by an excluded fiduciary that requires a prior authorization of the trust advisor if that excluded fiduciary timely sought but failed to obtain that authorization; (3) Any loss that results from any action or inaction, except for gross negligence or willful misconduct, when an excluded fiduciary is required, pursuant to the trust agreement or any other reason, to assume the role of trust advisor, or trust protector, investment trust advisor, or distribution trust advisor. Any excluded fiduciary is also relieved from any obligation to review or evaluate any direction from a distribution trust advisor or to perform investment or suitability reviews, inquiries, or investigations or to make recommendations or evaluations with respect to any investments to the extent the trust advisor, custodial account owner, or authorized designee of a custodial account owner had authority to direct the acquisition, disposition, or retention of any such the investment. If the excluded fiduciary offers such communication to the trust advisor, trust protector, investment trust advisor, or distribution trust advisor or any investment person selected by the investment trust advisor, such action may not be deemed to constitute an undertaking by the excluded fiduciary to monitor or otherwise participate in actions within the scope of the advisor's authority or to constitute any duty to do so. Any excluded fiduciary is also relieved of any duty to communicate with or warn or apprise any beneficiary or third party concerning instances in which the excluded fiduciary would or might have exercised the excluded fiduciary's own discretion in a manner different from the manner directed by the trust advisor, or trust protector, investment trust advisor, or distribution trust advisor. Absent contrary provisions in the governing instrument, the actions of the excluded fiduciary (such as any communications with the trust advisor and others and carrying out, recording, and reporting actions taken at the trust advisor's direction) pertaining to matters within the scope of authority of the trust advisor, or trust protector, investment trust advisor, or distribution trust advisor shall be deemed to be administrative actions taken by the excluded fiduciary solely to allow the excluded fiduciary to perform those duties assigned to the excluded fiduciary under the governing instrument, and such administrative actions may not be deemed to constitute an undertaking by the excluded fiduciary to monitor, participate, or otherwise take any fiduciary responsibility for actions within the scope of authority of the trust advisor, or trust protector, investment trust advisor, or distribution trust advisor. Nothing in subdivision (2) imposes an obligation or liability with respect to a custodian of a custodial account. In an action against an excluded fiduciary pursuant to the provisions of this section, the burden to prove the matter by clear and convincing evidence is on the person seeking to hold the excluded fiduciary liable. Section 24. That \u00a7 55-1B-4 be amended to read: 55-1B-4. If one or more trust advisors are given authority by the terms of a governing instrument to direct, consent to, or disapprove a fiduciary's investment decisions, or proposed investment decisions, such trust advisors shall be considered to be fiduciaries when exercising such authority unless the governing instrument provides otherwise. So long as there is at least one fiduciary exercising the authority of the investment advisor pursuant to \u00a7 55-1B-10 for the investment, except in the cases of willful misconduct or gross negligence by the fiduciary investment advisor in the selection or monitoring of the nonfiduciary trust advisors, the governing instrument may provide that such other trust advisors acting pursuant to this section are not acting in a fiduciary capacity. Section 25. That \u00a7 55-2-13 be amended to read: 55-2-13. Notification to any qualified beneficiary under this section may be carried out personally, by mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the entity or individual's last known post office address, or electronically pursuant to the provisions of \u00a7 15-6-5(d), and on representatives of qualified beneficiaries pursuant to chapter 55-18. For purposes of this section, the term, qualified beneficiary, means a beneficiary that is an entity then in existence or an individual who is twenty-one years of age or older and who, on the date the beneficiary's qualification is determined: (1) Is a distributee or permissible distributee of trust income or principal; (2) Would be a distributee or permissible distributee of trust income or principal if the interests of the distributees terminated on that date; or (3) Would be a distributee or permissible distributee of trust income or principal if the trust terminated on that date. However, if the distributee is then unknown because a person holds a power to change the distributee, the trustee shall give notice only to the holder of the power. Except as otherwise provided by the terms of a revocable trust, a trustee has no duty to notify the qualified beneficiaries of the trust's existence. Except as otherwise provided by the terms of an irrevocable trust or otherwise directed in writing by the settlor, trust advisor, or trust protector, the trustee shall, within sixty days after the trustee has accepted trusteeship of the trust, or within sixty days after the date the trustee acquires knowledge that a formerly revocable trust has become irrevocable, notify the qualified beneficiaries of the trust's existence and of the right of the beneficiary to request a copy of the trust instrument pertaining to the beneficiary's interest in the trust. Except as otherwise provided by the terms of an irrevocable trust or otherwise directed in writing by the settlor, trust advisor, or trust protector, a trustee of an irrevocable trust: (1) Upon request of a qualified beneficiary, shall promptly furnish to the qualified beneficiary a copy of the trust instrument; (2) If notification of the trust has not been accomplished pursuant to this section within sixty days after accepting a trusteeship, shall notify the qualified beneficiaries of the acceptance and of the trustee's name, address, and telephone number; (3) Shall promptly respond to a qualified beneficiary's request for information related to the administration of the trust, unless the request is unreasonable under the circumstances. The settlor, trust advisor, or trust protector, may, by the terms of the governing instrument, or in writing delivered to the trustee, expand, restrict, eliminate, or otherwise modify the rights of beneficiaries to information relating to a trust. Written directions provided by the settlor, trust advisor, or trust protector as set forth in this section remain in effect until and unless the settlor, trust advisor, or trust protector revokes the written instructions or is incapacitated. Additionally, the written directions remain in effect only while the trust advisor or trust protector providing the written directions is serving as the current trust advisor or trust protector. Unless otherwise specifically provided in the written directions, upon the death or incapacity of a settlor who provided the written directions described in this section, the directions shall be deemed revoked. However, upon the death or incapacity of the settlor, a trust advisor or trust protector, if any, may further direct the trustee in writing pursuant to this section. Unless otherwise stated in the governing instrument, in the event of a conflict in direction, the direction of the settlor shall control. A beneficiary may waive the right to the notice or information otherwise required to be furnished under this section and, with respect to future reports and other information, may withdraw a waiver previously given. The change in the identity of a trustee, occurring as the result of a mere name change or a merger, consolidation, combination, or reorganization of a trustee, does not require notice. If a fiduciary is bound by a duty of confidentiality with respect to a trust or its assets, a fiduciary may require that any beneficiary who is eligible to receive information pursuant to this section be bound by the duty of confidentiality that binds the trustee before receiving such information from the trustee. A trust advisor, trust protector, or other fiduciary designated by the terms of the trust shall keep each excluded fiduciary designated by the terms of the trust reasonably informed about: (1) The administration of the trust with respect to any specific duty or function being performed by the trust advisor, trust protector, or other fiduciary to the extent that the duty or function would normally be performed by the excluded fiduciary or to the extent that providing such information to the excluded fiduciary is reasonably necessary for the excluded fiduciary to perform its duties; and (2) Any other material information that the excluded fiduciary would be required to disclose to the qualified beneficiaries under this section regardless of whether the terms of the trust relieve the excluded fiduciary from providing such information to qualified beneficiaries. Neither the performance nor the failure to perform of a trust advisor, trust protector, or other fiduciary designated by the terms of the trust as provided in this subdivision shall affect the limitation on the liability of the excluded fiduciary. The provisions of this section are effective for trusts created, amended, or restated after June 30, 2002, except as otherwise directed by the settlor, trust protector, trust advisor, or other fiduciary designated by the terms of the trust. For trusts created before July 1, 2002, a trustee has no duty at common law or otherwise to notify a qualified beneficiary of the trust's existence unless otherwise directed by the settlor. The provisions of this paragraph do not apply if otherwise directed by the settlor, trust protector, trust advisor, or other fiduciary designated by the terms of the trust. Section 26. That \u00a7 55-3-27 be amended to read: 55-3-27. Except as otherwise provided by the terms of the trust, if the value of the trust property of a noncharitable trust is less than one hundred fifty thousand dollars, the trustee may terminate the trust.
