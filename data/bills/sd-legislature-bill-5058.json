Section 2. That \u00a7 55-1-24 be amended to read as follows: 55-1-24. Terms used in \u00a7\u00a7 55-1-24 to 55-1-43, inclusive, mean: (1) \"Beneficial interest,\" is limited to mean a current distribution interest or a remainder interest. A beneficial interest specifically excludes a power of appointment or a power reserved by the settlor; (2) \"Beneficiary,\" a person that has a present or future beneficial interest in a trust, vested or contingent. The holder of a power of appointment is not a beneficiary; (3) \" Current Distribution beneficiary,\" a beneficiary who , on the date the beneficiary's qualification is determined, is an eligible distributee or permissible distributee of trust income or principal; (4) \" Current distribution Distribution interest,\" a distribution interest held by a current distribution beneficiary. A distribution interest may be a current distribution interest or a future distribution interest. A current distribution interest may be classified as a mandatory interest, a support interest, or a discretionary interest; (5) \"Power of appointment,\" an inter-vivos or testamentary power to direct the disposition of trust property, other than a distribution decision by a trustee to a beneficiary. Powers of appointment are held by a person to whom a power has been given, not the settlor; (6) \"Remainder interest,\" an interest where a trust beneficiary will receive the property outright at some time during the future; (7) \"Reserved power,\" a power held by the settlor. Section 3. That chapter 55-1 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: For purposes of \u00a7 \u00a7 55-1-24 to 55-1-43, inclusive, improper motive is demonstrated by action such as the following: (1) A trustee refusing to make or limiting distributions to beneficiaries other than the trustee due to the trustee's self interest when the trustee also holds a beneficial interest subject to a discretionary interest; or (2) A trustee making a distribution in excess of an ascertainable standard to himself or herself as beneficiary when the trustee is restricted by an ascertainable standard in the trust. Section 4. That \u00a7 55-1-30 be amended to read as follows: 55-1-30. Neither a current distribution interest nor a remainder interest are factors relevant in the equitable division of marital property. Section 5. That \u00a7 55-1-37 be amended to read as follows: 55-1-37. A spendthrift provision applies to both current distribution interests and remainder interest interests . A spendthrift provision is a material provision of a trust. Section 6. That \u00a7 55-1-38 be amended to read as follows: 55-1-38. A current distribution interest can be classified in three ways: (1) As a mandatory interest, which is a current distribution interest where the trustee has no discretion in determining whether the distribution shall be made, or the amount or timing of such distribution; (2) As a support interest, which is not a mandatory interest but still contains mandatory language such as \"shall make distributions\" and is coupled with a standard capable of judicial interpretation; or (3) As a discretionary interest, which is any interest where a trustee has any discretion to make or withhold a distribution. A discretionary interest includes permissive language such as \"may make distributions\" or it may include mandatory language that is negated by the uncontrolled language of the trustee, such as \"the trustee shall make distributions in the trustee's sole and absolute discretion.\" A support interest that includes mandatory language such as \"shall\" but is subsequently qualified by discretionary language shall be classified as a discretionary interest and not as a support interest. A discretionary interest is any interest that is not a mandatory or a support interest. Section 7. That \u00a7 55-1-40 be amended to read as follows: 55-1-40.

The trustees may exclude any of the beneficiaries or may make unequal distributions among them\"; (e) \"The trustee may make distributions for health, education, maintenance, support, comfort, and general welfare. Section 8. That \u00a7 55-1-42 be amended to read as follows: 55-1-42. The following provisions apply only to support interests: (1) A beneficiary of a support interest has an enforceable right to a distribution pursuant to a court's review. A trustee's distribution decision may be reviewed for reasonableness if the trustee acts dishonestly, with an improper motive, or fails to act . This does not raise the beneficiary's interest to the level of a property interest; (2) If the trust contains a spendthrift provision, notwithstanding the beneficiary's right to force a distribution from of a support trust interest , no creditor may force a distribution from of a support interest. No creditor may attach present or future support distributions from of a support interest at the trust level. With respect to a mandatory interest, if a trust contains a spendthrift provision, notwithstanding the beneficiary's right to force a distribution of a mandatory interest, no creditor may force a distribution of a mandatory interest. No creditor may attach present or future mandatory distributions of a mandatory interest at the trust level. Regardless of whether a beneficiary has any outstanding creditor, a trustee of a mandatory or a support interest may directly pay any expense on behalf of such beneficiary.

Except as otherwise provided by the terms of the trust or otherwise directed by the settlor at any time, within sixty days after the date the trustee of an irrevocable trust acquires knowledge of the creation of an irrevocable trust, or upon the date the trustee acquires knowledge that a formerly revocable trust has become irrevocable, whether by death of the settlor or otherwise, the trustee shall notify the qualified beneficiaries of the trust's existence, of the identity of the settlor or settlors, and of the right of the beneficiary to request a copy of the trust instrument. A Subject to the previous provision, a trustee of an irrevocable trust: (1) Upon request of a qualified beneficiary, shall promptly furnish to the qualified beneficiary a copy of the trust instrument; (2) If notification of the trust has not been accomplished pursuant to this section within sixty days after accepting a trusteeship, shall notify the qualified beneficiaries of the acceptance and of the trustee's name, address, and telephone number; (3) Shall promptly respond to a qualified beneficiary's request for information related to the administration of the trust, unless the request is unreasonable under the circumstances.
