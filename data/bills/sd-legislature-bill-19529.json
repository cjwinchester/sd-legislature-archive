Premium rates for individual health benefit plans shall produce a minimum lifetime loss ratio of not less than sixty-five percent. The director may promulgate rules pursuant to chapter 1-26 which modify the minimum loss ratio required based on the specific design of the product or other objective and pertinent criteria. For individual health benefit plans that are in closed blocks and the health carrier has discontinued actively marketing in this state, the loss ratio is ninety percent unless the health carrier has implemented a medical management program or unless the health carrier has elected to enter into the arrangement specified in section 2 of this Act. No carrier is considered to have a medical management program unless the carrier has: (1) A program that has been filed and approved by the director on an annual basis; (2) Implemented a program that effectively manages diseases of insureds under the health benefit plans and can demonstrate actual cost savings; and (3) Entered into contracts with networks or directly with health care providers to achieve cost savings at a level consistent with the current health insurance market.

The health carrier, by electing to have the risk pool administer the closed block or blocks of business, is subject to the following: (1) An assessment from the risk pool designed to cover the extra administrative costs borne by the risk pool for administration of the closed block and the excess of claim costs over premiums; (2) All billing, customer service, and claims handling would be administered by the risk pool; (3) The rate for the insureds under the administration of the risk pool is limited to one hundred fifty percent of the amount specified in \u00a7 58-17-125; (4) The insureds may elect to have the benefit plan design changed to one of the options as provided by \u00a7 58-17-130; and (5) The plan under which the insureds are covered pursuant to this section, whether covered under their original benefit plan design or that provided by \u00a7 58-17-130, is subject to the preauthorization, disease management, and managed care provisions that the risk pool may adopt including out-of-network penalties for any network the risk pool may contract with directly or indirectly for such insureds.
