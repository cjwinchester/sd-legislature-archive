BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 25-7-6.16 be amended to read as follows: 25-7-6.16. The court may enter an order for health and dental insurance coverage. Medical insurance shall be provided for the benefit of the minor child whenever practical. The cost of the insurance attributable to the child shall be determined by dividing the out-of-pocket cost of the insurance to the parent by the number of individuals insured thereunder. However, if information is provided at the time of hearing regarding the actual additional costs for the child's share of the insurance, that figure shall be used. The cost so computed shall be apportioned between the parents on the basis of income or income imputed as provided in \u00a7 \u00a7 25-7-6.1 to 25-7-6.17, inclusive. If one parent pays the entire amount, that parent shall either be reimbursed by the other parent for that parent's portion of the payment or shall receive a credit against his or her support obligation, whichever is appropriate. Any additional, reasonable medical costs, including optometric, dental or orthodontic, counseling, or other health care costs for each minor child which exceed two hundred fifty five hundred dollars in any year and are not covered by insurance, shall be apportioned between the parents in proportion to the support obligation of each parent."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 17811, "action_date": "2003-01-29T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 96047, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/96047.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 203, "committee_id_action": 798, "committee_id_assigned": 796, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 17811, "action_date": "2003-02-03T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 96388, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/96388.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to 41st legislative day", "journal_page": 256, "committee_id_action": 796, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 55928, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [2845, 2858, 2863, 2869, 2873, 2902, 2907, 2913, 2922], "Nay": [2848, 2894, 2895], "Excused": [2899]}}, {"bill_id": 17811, "action_date": "2003-02-03T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 96388, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/96388.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 796, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/17811"}
