If there is a conflict in the determination of the damage caused by the permitted action, the parties involved in the permitted action, including those affected by the action, may seek mediation services. Section 28. Each district council may levy a tax, not to exceed thirty cents per thousand dollars of taxable valuation in the district to accomplish the purposes of this Act. Section 29. Each district council may make special assessments against real property specially benefited by a project, if each person seeking the assessment or an entity authorized to act on the person's behalf have contractually agreed to the special assessments as a means of providing local funding. Section 30. Only a landowner who by contract agrees to a special assessment to finance a project pursuant to this Act, may be specially assessed. Any person who joins a project after a petition has been filed with the district council pursuant to this Act may join the project by contract. However, a person joining a project late may be required to make special payments in addition to special assessments in order to bear the person's fair share of project costs. Section 31. Upon receipt of a petition requesting a special assessment, the council shall hold a hearing on the question. Notice of the time and place of the hearing shall be published at least once each week for two consecutive weeks before the hearing in the official newspapers of the district. The last publication of the notice shall be at least ten days before the hearing. If, after the hearing, the council determines that the project is consistent with the best interests of the district, it may adopt a resolution of intent to specially assess real property benefited by the project. Section 32. Within twenty days after adoption of a resolution of intent to levy a special assessment, the council shall give written notice to each owner of the real property described in the resolution. Each owner entitled to notice is the owner of the real property to be assessed listed in the records in the office of the register of deeds of the county where the real property is located. If real property is sold under a contract for deed which is of record in the office of the register of deeds, both the landowner and the purchaser of the land, as named in the contract for deed, shall be entitled to notice. Each notice shall be sent by registered or certified mail. The notice is effective upon the date mailed, and shall contain the following: (1) A description of the contract under which the assessment is to be made; (2) A legal description of the real property of the affected owner to be specially assessed; (3) A description of the nature of the benefit to be returned to the property; and (4) Notice of the right to protest by petition. Section 33. Any special assessment by a district is effective thirty days after adoption of the resolution of intent to specially assess, unless a written protest is filed with the office of the district within thirty days of adoption of the resolution, excluding the date of adoption. The written protest shall be in the form of a petition signed by not less than sixty percent of the owners of real property described in the resolution of intent to specially assess. Section 34. A district may assist, sponsor, or construct a project pursuant to this Act. Each project shall provide that specific geographic areas finance those phases of the project that provide general benefits to people in the specific geographic areas, that direct beneficiaries shall finance those phases of the project that protect or enhance the value of the beneficiaries property, and that administrative jurisdiction and responsibility for the various phases of the project are related to the variable degrees of benefits. Section 35. A district may levy taxes and special assessments, as provided and limited by this Act to cover obligations contained in contracts with the United States, or any agency of the United States, with agencies of the State of South Dakota, or with any other entity, public or private, to accomplish the purposes of this Act. Except for a special assessment, however, a district may not obligate any funds or revenues that are not to be collected or on hand during the fiscal year in which the obligation is incurred. Section 36. A district council may levy a tax or a special assessment or both against taxable property within the boundaries of the district, to be collected by the appropriate tax collecting entities. The collection from the tax shall be deposited monthly with the council by the appropriate tax collecting official. The council shall deposit the funds received from the appropriate tax collecting official in depositories designated by the council. Disbursements from the designated depository account shall be made pursuant to procedures adopted by the council. Section 37. The council shall, by July 1, 2017, and annually thereafter on a date established by the district, but before the first of October, adopt a budget and prepare an operations and budget report. The report shall present estimates and itemizations of all the expenses and obligations of the district, including expenses of council members, expenses of operating the office, debt service and retirement, and obligations and liabilities to the United States. Before approval of the budget by the council, a public hearing shall be held. The notice of the hearing shall be published once each week for two successive weeks in the district's official newspapers. The notice shall state the time and place of the hearing, its purpose, and that at the hearing all persons interested may appear, either in person or by representative, and be heard and given an opportunity for a full and complete discussion of all items in the budget. With the first notice, the budget shall be published in a form approved by the auditor general. At the conclusion of the hearing, the district council may eliminate or amend any portion of the budget before adoption. Section 38. Upon completion and adoption of a budget, a district council shall make a tax levy or special assessment or both in dollars sufficient to fund the budget. Any tax levy made against the property in any given county in a district shall be in an amount equal to the total district tax levy in dollars multiplied by the county's proportional share. The county's proportional share shall be determined by dividing the equalized assessed valuation of the area within the district for that county by the total district equalized assessed valuation. The provisions of \u00a7 10-12-34.1 may not prohibit apportionment of the tax among the counties as provided in this section. No tax levy may be in excess of the limitation specified in this Act. Any tax levy shall be in the form of a resolution adopted by a majority vote of the members of the council. Section 39. Immediately after completion of a budget and adoption of each special assessment and a tax levy by a district council, but not later than the first of October, the district shall send one certified copy of the levy as adopted and one certified copy of such budget to appropriate tax collecting officials of the affected counties and to the state secretary of revenue. Section 40. The appropriate official shall extend the levy or special assessment upon the tax list of the county, municipality, or other appropriate tax paying entity for the tax year against each description of taxable property or, in the case of a special assessment, against each description of taxable property to be specially assessed within the district in the same manner and with the same effect as other taxes and assessments are extended, including the authority, requirements, and procedures contained in chapter 9-43. Section 41. The appropriate tax collecting official shall collect all district taxes and assessments, together with interest and penalty thereon, if any, in the same manner as the general taxes and assessments are collected and shall pay over monthly to the district all taxes so collected during the preceding month, with interest and penalties. The district shall immediately enter these receipts to the credit of the depository accounts designated by the council pursuant to this Act. Section 42. All money collected pursuant to the tax levies, special assessments and other funds authorized by this Act accruing to the district shall be deposited either in the accounts of the state treasurer to the credit of the \"(name) district fund\" to be disbursed only as provided by this Act, or in any depository designated and approved by the council at a regular meeting and from which all valid claims against the district shall be paid by order duly drawn by the council pursuant to procedures adopted by the council. Section 43. That \u00a7 46A-10A-20 be repealed. 46A-10A-20. Official controls instituted by a board may include specific ordinances, resolutions, orders, regulations, or other such legal controls pertaining to other elements incorporated in a drainage plan, project, or area or establishing standards and procedures to be employed toward drainage management. Any such ordinances, resolutions, regulations, or controls shall embody the basic principle that any rural land which drains onto other rural land has a right to continue such drainage if: (1) The land receiving the drainage remains rural in character; (2) The land being drained is used in a reasonable manner; (3) The drainage creates no unreasonable hardship or injury to the owner of the land receiving the drainage; (4) The drainage is natural and occurs by means of a natural water course or established water course; (5) The owner of the land being drained does not substantially alter on a permanent basis the course of flow, the amount of flow, or the time of flow from that which would occur; and (6) No other feasible alternative drainage system is available that will produce less harm without substantially greater cost to the owner of the land being drained. Such provisions do not necessarily apply within municipalities, but if a municipality drains water onto rural lands lying outside the boundaries of the municipality, the municipality is subject to the above provisions, if adopted by the board. Section 44. That \u00a7\u00a7 46A-10A-1 to 46A-10A-19, inclusive, and \u00a7\u00a7 46A-10A-21 to 46A-10A-123, inclusive, be repealed. Section 45. The provisions of this Act do not abrogate or limit the rights, powers, duties, and functions of the State Water Management Board or the Department of Environment and Natural Resources with reference to title 46, title 46A, or title 34A. Section 46. The effective date of sections 43, 44, and 45 of this Act is July 1, 2017."}, {"bill_id": 6170, "bill_version_id": 35090, "bill_version": "Senate Agriculture and Natural Resources Engrossed", "bill_version_date": "2015-02-17T13:54:44.153-06:00", "bill_text": "FOR AN ACT ENTITLED, An Act to provide for the establishment of river basin natural resource districts.
