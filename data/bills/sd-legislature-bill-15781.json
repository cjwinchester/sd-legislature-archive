WHEREAS, the stated goal of the Department of Game, Fish and Parks' Animal Damage Control (ADC) Program is to minimize wildlife damage to private and public land, domestic livestock and other vital agricultural interests using effective, socially acceptable, and biologically sound methods that provide for the health and welfare of wildlife resources and the citizens of this state; and WHEREAS, the state ADC Program is recognized by many as one of the most efficient, responsive, and professional programs in existence; a program that has proudly served the citizens of South Dakota for more than a quarter century and upon which countless numbers of livestock producers depend to reduce livestock losses and safeguard their vital and often tenuous economic livelihood; and WHEREAS, the United States Congress passed the 1931 Animal Damage Control Act which instructed the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) to cooperate with the states in providing for the control of predatory animals; and WHEREAS, the federal government in 1974, by virtue of a cooperative agreement, relinquished ADC Program services and subsequent program management responsibilities to the South Dakota Department of Game, Fish and Parks. As part of that cooperative agreement, the federal government provided the department an annual grant-in-aid in the amount of $300,000 to bolster ADC Program services statewide. That amount was lowered to $298,000 in fiscal year 1998; and WHEREAS, the federal grant-in-aid, while helpful, has remained static since its inception, failing even to account for simple inflation. This has placed an undue financial burden on the counties and sportsmen and women whose respective tax and game and fish license revenues account for the vast majority of ADC Program expenditures, estimated at $1.4 million in fiscal year 2000. In essence, the federal financial commitment has diminished proportionally over time while the demand for program services, and subsequent financial burden to the State of South Dakota and its counties, continues to rise; and WHEREAS, the Department of Game, Fish and Parks has sought and received the support of the South Dakota congressional delegation who, on behalf of the citizens of South Dakota, have made several formal requests that USDA increase the amount of the federal grant-in-aid South Dakota currently receives for its ADC Program. USDA Secretary Dan Glickman has summarily denied these requests: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the House of Representatives of the Seventy- fifth Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the Senate concurring therein, that the South Dakota Legislature wholeheartedly and steadfastly supports the professional services provided the citizens of South Dakota, agricultural producers in particular, by the Animal Damage Control Program. In order for the ADC Program to continue providing its high level of service, it is imperative that the funding source be made more secure. We join our legislative counterparts at the federal level and respectfully request the United States Department of Agriculture to increase the amount of South Dakota's federal grant-in-aid to a minimum of $500,000 annually and further request the amount be automatically adjusted in accordance with the previous year's estimated rate of inflation. We further believe the $500,000 amount is reasonable considering the state has received no increase in the federal grant-in-aid for over twenty-five years and that the State of South Dakota and its counties continue to provide the vast majority of operating revenue for the ADC Program."}, {"bill_id": 15781, "bill_version_id": 87274, "bill_version": "Enrolled", "bill_version_date": "2000-02-23T00:00:00-06:00", "bill_text": "February 10, 2000 February 17, 2000"}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 15781, "action_date": "2000-02-10T08:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 85905, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/85905.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 642, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 15781, "action_date": "2000-02-10T08:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 85905, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/85905.pdf", "status_text": "Adopt Resolution", "journal_page": 556, "committee_id_action": 642, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 44199, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [2318, 2367], "Yea": [2327, 2341, 2354, 2366, 2390, 2392, 2403, 2316, 2355, 2404, 2309]}}, {"bill_id": 15781, "action_date": "2000-02-11T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 85666, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/85666.pdf", "status_text": "Adopt Resolution", "journal_page": 605, "committee_id_action": 656, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 46210, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [2305, 2308, 2309, 2312, 2313, 2314, 2315, 2316, 2317, 2318, 2319, 2321, 2323, 2324, 2325, 2327, 2328, 2332, 2333, 2334, 2336, 2337, 2338, 2341, 2342, 2343, 2345, 2348, 2349, 2350, 2353, 2354, 2355, 2356, 2359, 2360, 2361, 2362, 2363, 2366, 2367, 2368, 2370, 2371, 2372, 2373, 2374, 2377, 2378, 2379, 2382, 2383, 2384, 2385, 2387, 2388, 2390, 2392, 2393, 2397, 2401, 2402, 2406, 2407, 2408, 2351], "Excused": [2394, 2396, 2403, 2404]}}, {"bill_id": 15781, "action_date": "2000-02-17T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 85955, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/85955.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 630, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 15781, "action_date": "2000-02-17T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 85955, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/85955.pdf", "status_text": "Concur In resolution", "journal_page": 544, "committee_id_action": 630, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 44656, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [2310, 2311, 2346, 2347, 2358, 2386, 2398, 2400, 2329]}}, {"bill_id": 15781, "action_date": "2000-02-17T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 85955, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/85955.pdf", "status_text": "Place on Consent Calendar", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 630, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 15781, "action_date": "2000-02-18T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 85677, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/85677.pdf", "status_text": "Remove from Consent Calendar", "journal_page": 573, "committee_id_action": 657, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 15781, "action_date": "2000-02-22T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 85679, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/85679.pdf", "status_text": "Concur In resolution", "journal_page": 599, "committee_id_action": 657, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 44792, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [2304, 2306, 2307, 2311, 2320, 2322, 2326, 2329, 2330, 2331, 2335, 2339, 2340, 2344, 2346, 2347, 2352, 2357, 2358, 2364, 2365, 2369, 2376, 2380, 2381, 2386, 2389, 2391, 2398, 2399, 2400, 2405], "Excused": [2310], "Nay": [2375, 2395]}}]}
