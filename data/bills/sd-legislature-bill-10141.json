WHEREAS, while Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias have been traditionally seen as an aging issue, these conditions constitute a public health issue, due to the large burden on society and the significant impact, but there are ways to intervene with the disease; and WHEREAS, South Dakota has the third highest Alzheimer's death rate in America, and Alzheimer's is the fifth leading cause of death in South Dakota; and WHEREAS, South Dakota has seen a one hundred thirty-five percent increase in Alzheimer's deaths since 2000; and WHEREAS, seventeen thousand South Dakotans are living with Alzheimer's, with approximately sixty percent of the people impacted being men and forty percent women; and WHEREAS, the number of South Dakotans living with Alzheimer's is estimated to grow to twenty thousand by 2025; and WHEREAS, South Dakota spends significant resources annually caring for people with Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias; and WHEREAS, thirty-eight thousand caregivers, including family, friends, and neighbors, in South Dakota are providing care to persons with Alzheimer's Disease or related dementias, saving the state considerable money and resources; and WHEREAS, nearly sixty percent of these caregivers have been providing care to a person with Alzheimer's Disease or related dementias for at least two years; and WHEREAS, caregiving for individuals with Alzheimer's Disease or related dementias often takes an enormous toll on family members and creates important needs to reduce stress, depression, injuries, anxiety, isolation, and other health issues that caregivers of persons with Alzheimer's Disease or related dementias often face; and WHEREAS, the onset of Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias cannot yet be stopped or reversed, but early detection and diagnosis allow persons with dementia and their families a better chance of receiving and benefitting from treatment, care, support services, and more time to put legal, financial and advanced directives in place for the future: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the House of Representatives of the Ninety-Fourth Legislature of the State of South Dakota, that stakeholders in healthcare, legal, and financial sectors, and the patients and families affected by Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias are encouraged to continue to work together toward meaningful solutions to address the public health impact of Alzheimer's Disease in South Dakota."}, {"bill_id": 10141, "bill_version_id": 54182, "bill_version": "Enrolled", "bill_version_date": "2019-02-25T09:01:34.67-06:00", "bill_text": ""}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 10141, "action_date": "2019-02-21T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 54040, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/54040.pdf", "status_text": "First Reading", "journal_page": 461, "committee_id_action": 408, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 10141, "action_date": "2019-02-22T13:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 54134, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/54134.pdf", "status_text": "Adopt Resolution", "journal_page": 480, "committee_id_action": 408, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 28720, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [1563, 1614, 1619, 1567, 1592, 1643, 1578, 1641, 1560, 1629, 1579, 1613, 1645, 1594, 1443, 1633, 1634, 1444, 1434, 1573, 1616, 1650, 1635, 1624, 1557, 1628, 1427, 1436, 1642, 1438, 1620, 1631, 1589, 1556, 1593, 1639, 1609, 1649, 1632, 1646, 1612, 1630, 1431, 1446, 1615, 1638, 1569, 1626, 1572, 1637, 1627, 1577, 1618, 1581, 1576, 1610, 1622, 1623, 1611, 1564, 1621, 1580, 1625, 1432], "Excused": [1440, 1590, 1435, 1644, 1575, 1647]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/10141"}
