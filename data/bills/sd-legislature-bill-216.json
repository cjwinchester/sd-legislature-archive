The board's share of the installed capacity of the wind energy conversion systems authorized by this section may not exceed three and three tenths megawatts of nameplate capacity. Any school district owning, operating, or selling energy from a wind energy conversion system shall integrate information about wind energy conversion systems into its educational programming. For purposes of this section, the term, wind energy conversion system, means any device, such as a wind charger, windmill, or wind turbine, that converts wind energy to a form of usable energy. Section 2. That \u00a7 1-16I-3 be amended to read as follows: 1-16I-3. The authority may provide for the financing, construction, development, maintenance, and operation of new or upgraded energy transmission facilities or any wind energy conversion system associated with a school district as provided in sections 1 and 3 of this Act . The authority may own, lease, or rent such facilities. The authority may enter into partnerships with public and private entities to develop and operate such facilities. Section 3. That chapter 1-16I be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: The authority may undertake any wind energy conversion system project authorized pursuant to section 1 of this Act for the benefit of one or more school districts and may issue its bonds to finance the cost of the project, all to the same extent and subject to the same provisions applicable to the undertaking and financing of other facilities under this chapter. The authority may make loans and grants to, and enter into financing agreements with, any school district for the costs incurred in connection with the development, construction, acquisition, improvement, maintenance, operation, or decommissioning of a wind energy conversion system authorized pursuant to section 1 of this Act, or for the maintenance of the physical or structural integrity of real or personal property incorporated or which may be incorporated into the facility, in accordance with a written agreement between the authority and the school district. No such loan or grant may exceed the total cost of the facility as determined by the school district and approved by the authority. Section 4.
