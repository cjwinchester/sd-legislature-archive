WHEREAS, more than sixty-two thousand South Dakotans are American Indians; and WHEREAS, the Indian Health Service is the primary provider of dental health care to American Indians who live in South Dakota; and WHEREAS, the Indian Health Service is required to provide dental services to the entire American Indian population, but does so for only about twenty-four percent of that population; and WHEREAS, Indian Health Service clinics labor under a forty percent vacancy rate for dentists in South Dakota, which causes a significant impediment to providing needed dental care; and WHEREAS, preventing and treating dental disease results in health care savings, improved health status for diabetics, fewer missed class hours for school children, and fewer missed work hours for adults; and WHEREAS, a shortage of adequate loan repayment funding has contributed to the inability of the Indian Health Service to attract and retain dentists at their clinics in South Dakota; and WHEREAS, the Indian Health Service needs an additional six million dollars for loan repayment to fill all dental vacancies: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the Senate of the Eighty-first Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the House of Representatives concurring therein, that the South Dakota Legislature supports a request of six million dollars for loan repayment to fill dental vacancies in the Indian Health Service nation-wide, and encourages Senators Tim Johnson and John Thune, and Representative Stephanie Herseth to support this request for the Indian Health Service in the FY 2007 Budget and Interior Appropriations bills."}, {"bill_id": 20664, "bill_version_id": 107766, "bill_version": "Enrolled", "bill_version_date": "2006-02-02T09:16:00-06:00", "bill_text": ""}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 20664, "action_date": "2006-01-27T13:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 107421, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/107421.pdf", "status_text": "Introduced", "journal_page": 231, "committee_id_action": 894, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 20664, "action_date": "2006-01-30T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 107534, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/107534.pdf", "status_text": "Adopt Resolution", "journal_page": 251, "committee_id_action": 894, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 63815, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [3361, 3362, 3363, 3364, 3365, 3368, 3374, 3376, 3377, 3379, 3384, 3390, 3391, 3396, 3397, 3404, 3409, 3411, 3412, 3413, 3415, 3416, 3421, 3423, 3425, 3428, 3430, 3432, 3435, 3439, 3447, 3450, 3452, 3453, 3458]}}, {"bill_id": 20664, "action_date": "2006-01-31T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 107629, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/107629.pdf", "status_text": "Introduced", "journal_page": 297, "committee_id_action": 893, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 20664, "action_date": "2006-02-01T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 107742, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/107742.pdf", "status_text": "Concur In resolution", "journal_page": 322, "committee_id_action": 893, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 64322, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [3366, 3367, 3369, 3370, 3372, 3373, 3378, 3380, 3381, 3382, 3383, 3385, 3386, 3387, 3388, 3389, 3392, 3394, 3395, 3398, 3399, 3400, 3401, 3402, 3403, 3405, 3406, 3407, 3408, 3410, 3414, 3417, 3418, 3419, 3420, 3422, 3424, 3427, 3429, 3431, 3433, 3434, 3436, 3437, 3438, 3440, 3441, 3442, 3443, 3444, 3445, 3446, 3448, 3449, 3451, 3454, 3455, 3456, 3457, 3459, 3460, 3461, 3462, 3463, 3464, 3465, 3426], "Excused": [3371, 3375, 3393]}}]}
