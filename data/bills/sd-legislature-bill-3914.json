BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. For the 2013-2014 and 2014-2015 school years, a school district may apply for innovation grants. A maximum of twelve, two-year grants shall be awarded in each of the two school years. The total amount of any innovation grant awarded may not exceed one dollar per year for each of the two years, and the total amount of any grant awarded pursuant to this Act shall be matched dollar for dollar or in-kind by the school district receiving the grant. Of the twelve total grants to be awarded over the two-year period, eight shall be awarded to school districts with a current fall enrollment as defined in \u00a7 13-13-10.1 of less than six hundred, eight shall be awarded to school districts with a current fall enrollment of at least six hundred, but less than two thousand, and eight shall be awarded to school districts with a current fall enrollment of two thousand or more. Section 2. The Board of Education shall select grant recipients from among school districts that apply based upon the following criteria: (1) The school district's demonstrated sound budget practices such as the school district's use of resources to keep an attendance center open, or to increase teachers' salaries, or to positively impact student achievement; (2) The school district's use of technology in the district's innovation strategies; (3) The school district's collaboration and coordination with other school districts in sharing administrative and teaching resources or with other entities in the community in creating a culture for innovation; and (4) Any other creative approach the school district is taking in the delivery of instruction. Any school district that applies for a grant pursuant to this Act shall demonstrate how the innovation for which the grant is sought will support and positively impact student achievement and will be sustainable and impact life-long learning and long term student achievement. Any grant awarded pursuant to this Act may be used to enhance career and technical education. Section 3. Any school district may apply for a grant provided pursuant to this Act by applying on forms provided by the Department of Education. Section 4. The Board of Education shall promulgate rules pursuant to chapter 1-26 to establish the grant application process and timelines. The board shall also conduct a quantitative evaluation of each innovation for which a grant is awarded after each of the two years and conduct a final outcome assessment after the second year. The board shall report the findings of each final outcome assessment to the Legislature for use in future planning. Nothing in this Act is intended to create a property right or contract right in innovation grants. Section 5. There is hereby appropriated from the general fund the sum of one dollar ($1), or so much thereof as may be necessary, to the Department of Education for the purpose of awarding innovation grants pursuant to this Act to school districts. Section 6. The secretary of education shall approve vouchers and the state auditor shall draw warrants to pay expenditures authorized by this Act. Section 7. Any amounts appropriated in this Act not lawfully expended or obligated by June 30, 2015, shall revert in accordance with the procedures prescribed in chapter 4-8."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 3914, "action_date": "2013-01-22T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 24266, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/24266.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 133, "committee_id_action": 202, "committee_id_assigned": 189, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 3914, "action_date": "2013-01-28T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 24624, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/24624.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 189, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 3914, "action_date": "2013-01-28T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 24755, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/24755.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to the 41st legislative day", "journal_page": 203, "committee_id_action": 189, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 13011, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [420, 418, 412, 396, 416, 389, 414, 405, 406, 361, 391, 373], "Nay": [378, 374, 357]}}, {"bill_id": 3914, "action_date": "2013-01-30T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 24975, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/24975.pdf", "status_text": "Reconsidered", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 189, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 13127, "president_vote": null, "Excused": [420], "Yea": [418, 412, 416, 414, 378, 406, 361, 373, 374, 357], "Nay": [396, 389, 405, 391]}}, {"bill_id": 3914, "action_date": "2013-01-30T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 24975, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/24975.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 189, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "F", "vote": {"vote_id": 13136, "president_vote": null, "Excused": [420], "Yea": [418, 412, 378, 361, 373, 374, 357], "Nay": [396, 416, 389, 414, 405, 406, 391]}}, {"bill_id": 3914, "action_date": "2013-01-30T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 24975, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/24975.pdf", "status_text": "Tabled", "journal_page": 248, "committee_id_action": 189, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 13137, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [420, 396, 416, 389, 414, 405, 406, 391], "Nay": [418, 412, 378, 361, 373, 374, 357]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/3914"}
