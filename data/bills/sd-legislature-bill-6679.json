WHEREAS, on December 7, 1984, the State of South Dakota and the Republic of China (Taiwan) entered into a sister state relationship of enduring friendship and international cooperation; and WHEREAS, Taiwan shares with South Dakota the common values of freedom, democracy, human rights, and rule of law; and WHEREAS, over the past thirty-one years, the bonds of true friendship and steadfast trade partnership between South Dakota and Taiwan have been strengthened, resulting in a strong economic, social, cultural exchange, and tourism; and WHEREAS, every other year, Taiwan has sent an agricultural trade goodwill mission to the U.S. Midwest region including South Dakota to demonstrate Taiwan's continuing goodwill and willingness to purchase South Dakota agricultural products and the South Dakota agricultural industry has benefitted greatly over the past two decades from the sale of beef, wheat, and corn to Taiwan; and WHEREAS, the commercial interaction between South Dakota and Taiwan has grown substantially with each passing year, resulting in increased economic growth for both Taiwan and South Dakota; and WHEREAS, the United States ranks as Taiwan's third largest trading partner; Taiwan is the tenth largest trading partner of the United States; and bilateral trade has reached sixty-three billion six hundred million US dollars; and WHEREAS, the Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA) meeting between the United States and Taiwan is laying the groundwork for a possible Bilateral Investment Agreement (BIA); negotiation for a BIA is an important step toward further strengthening bilateral trade and paving the way for entering into a Free Trade Agreement between the United States and Taiwan, thereby increasing the exports of South Dakota to Taiwan and creating bilateral investment through tariff reduction and other trade facilitation measures; and WHEREAS, Taiwan, seeking to contribute to greater regional integration in the Asia-Pacific region and promotion of bilateral investment and trade relations with the United States, applauds the United States announcement of its intent not only to join the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), the proposed twenty-first century trade agreement between the U.S. and eleven other Asia-Pacific Rim countries, but to expand TPP membership in the future to include other countries, such as the Republic of China (Taiwan); and WHEREAS, Taiwan's inclusion in the TPP would contribute substantially to the depth, viability, and quality of the TPP, Taiwan's strong economic weight in the Asia-Pacific and the world, its well-developed knowledge base and highly-skilled workforce, its vital position along regional supply chains and value chains, and the positive economic and strategic gains for all make Taiwan an ideal candidate economy for the TPP's expansion; and WHEREAS, the development of international civil aviation in a safe and orderly manner is the supreme cause of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO); the international civil aviation depends to a great extent on multilateral cooperation to achieve the goals of safety order and sustainable development; and WHEREAS, Taiwan is an integral part of the global aviation network; with an excellent geographic location, Taiwan is a key aviation hub for regions in Asia and the world; and WHEREAS, Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport is ranked sixteenth globally in international passenger traffic by the Airports Council International (ACI), and fifty-eight domestic and foreign airlines connect Taiwan with one hundred seventeen cities across the world; and WHEREAS, the Taipei Flight Information Region (FIR) each year provides more than one million three hundred thousand navigation services to aircraft carrying forty-five million passengers and over one million six hundred eighty thousand tons of cargo. The large volume of cargo and passenger traffic make Taiwan an important part of the global air transport network; and WHEREAS, without Taiwan's participation, international flight plans, regulations, and procedure that the ICAO formulates will be incomplete and unsafe; and WHEREAS, Taiwan's request to participate in the ICAO is fully in line with the United States government's policy of supporting Taiwan's meaningful participation in United Nations specialized agencies: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the Senate of the Ninetieth Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the House of Representatives concurring therein: (1) That the South Dakota Legislature is celebrating the thirty-first anniversary of sister state relations with the Republic of China (Taiwan); and (2) That the South Dakota Legislature supports Taiwan's efforts to entry into the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and endorses the signing of the Bilateral Investment Agreement (BIA)with the United States; and (3) That the South Dakota Legislature endorses Taiwan's participation in the International CivilAviation Organization (ICAO) as an observer; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that copies of this resolution are sent to the United States Secretary of State John F. Kerry, President Ma Ying-jeou of the Republic of China (Taiwan), Secretary General Raymond Benjamin of the International Civil Aviation Organization, each member of the South Dakota Congressional Delegation, and Director General Jack J.C.
