BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 13-28-2 be amended to read as follows: 13-28-2. Any child who is five years old on the first day of September is eligible for enrollment in kindergarten during that school year. Any school district may allow a child who is five years old on the thirty-first day of December to enroll in kindergarten during that school year if the child has passed an examination or screening that is approved by the school district and has been designed to assess child development and the child's readiness for kindergarten. The school district may recover the costs of the examination or screening from the child's parent or guardian. If the school district chooses to recover the examination or screening costs, low- income families are responsible for such costs at the same ratio and under the same eligibility criteria that apply to the payment of reduced charges for the school lunch program. Any child who is six years old by September first is eligible for enrollment in first grade during that school year. Any child in a kindergarten or prekindergarten program who was in compliance with the statutory eligibility dates in effect at the time of his enrollment may proceed in a continuous educational program without interruption. Any child who transfers from another state may proceed in a continuous educational program without interruption. Any child under the age of five is eligible for admittance to a nursery school."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 12612, "action_date": "1997-01-28T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 72886, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/72886.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 172, "committee_id_action": 544, "committee_id_assigned": 533, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 12612, "action_date": "1997-02-06T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 72302, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/72302.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 533, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 12612, "action_date": "1997-02-06T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 72302, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/72302.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass,", "journal_page": 337, "committee_id_action": 533, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "F", "vote": {"vote_id": 35584, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [1891, 1914, 1918, 1929, 1902, 1895], "Nay": [1903, 1942, 1898, 1948, 1949, 1892], "Excused": [1907]}}, {"bill_id": 12612, "action_date": "1997-02-06T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 72302, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/72302.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass,", "journal_page": 337, "committee_id_action": 533, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "F", "vote": {"vote_id": 35584, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [1891, 1914, 1918, 1929, 1902, 1895], "Nay": [1903, 1942, 1898, 1948, 1949, 1892], "Excused": [1907]}}, {"bill_id": 12612, "action_date": "1997-02-06T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 72302, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/72302.pdf", "status_text": "Tabled", "journal_page": 337, "committee_id_action": 533, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 37912, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [1891, 1942, 1902, 1892, 1895], "Yea": [1903, 1914, 1918, 1929, 1898, 1948, 1949], "Excused": [1907]}}, {"bill_id": 12612, "action_date": "1997-02-06T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 72302, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/72302.pdf", "status_text": "Tabled", "journal_page": 337, "committee_id_action": 533, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 37912, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [1891, 1942, 1902, 1892, 1895], "Yea": [1903, 1914, 1918, 1929, 1898, 1948, 1949], "Excused": [1907]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/12612"}
