The proper highway authority, responsible for maintenance of the highways, shall set reduced load limits during this period and may increase, lessen, or remove these restrictions or extend the time period if highway conditions warrant. That authority may be exercised without formal resolution if the highway authority erects or causes to be erected and maintained signs designating the restrictions. Nothing in this requirement, however, removes or interferes with the proper highway authority imposing restrictions as set forth in \u00a7 \u00a7 32-14-6, 32-14-7, and 32-22-25 to 32-22-27, inclusive . Moreover, during the time period mentioned in this section the transportation commission may, pursuant to \u00a7 32-22-42, allow the issuance of overweight permits to heavier vehicles to permit them such vehicles to be operated on those highways which the commission designates as capable of handling heavier loads.

Notice of any restriction under this section shall be given by placing at the beginning and each end of that section of highway on which the allowable weight limit is reduced and at points of intersection, as deemed necessary by the proper highway authority, signs of substantial construction which conspicuously indicate the limitations of the gross weight of the vehicle. Exceeding such weight limits is a Class 2 misdemeanor. Section 3. That \u00a7 32-14-6 be amended to read as follows: 32-14-6. Local authorities, including road districts, may by ordinance or resolution prohibit the operation of vehicles upon any highway or impose restrictions as to the weight of vehicles for a total period not to exceed ninety days in any one calendar year allowed . Such prohibitions or restrictions apply only to vehicles to be operated upon any highway under the jurisdiction of and for the maintenance of which such local authorities are responsible and only if the highway by reason of deterioration physical condition , rain, snow, or other climatic conditions will be seriously damaged or destroyed unless the use of vehicles on the highway is prohibited or the permissible weights of the vehicles are reduced.
