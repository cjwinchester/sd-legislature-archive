The supervised work community service program shall be of a constructive nature designed to promote rehabilitation, appropriate to the age level and physical ability of the child, and shall be combined with counseling by the court services officer or other guidance personnel. The supervised work community service program assignment shall be made for a period of time consistent with the child's best interests, but for not more than ninety days; (4) The court may place the child at the Human Services Center for examination and treatment; (5) The court may commit the child to the Department of Corrections; (6) The court may place the child in a detention facility for not more than ninety days, which may be in addition to any period of temporary custody; (7)(6) The court may place the child in an alternative educational program; (8)(7) The court may order the suspension or revocation of the child's right to apply for a driving privilege, suspend or revoke an existing driving privilege, or restrict the privilege in such manner as it sees fit, including requiring that financial responsibility be proved and maintained; (9)(8) The court may assess or charge costs and fees permitted by \u00a7\u00a7 16-2-41, 23-3-52, 23A-27-26, 23A-28B-42, and 23A-27-27 against the child, parent, guardian, custodian, or other party responsible for the child; or (9) The court may only commit a child to the Department of Corrections if the judge finds that: (a) No viable alternative exists; (b) The Department of Corrections is the least restrictive alternative; and (c) The child is currently adjudicated delinquent for an offense eligible for transfer proceedings pursuant to \u00a7 26-11-3.1; the child is currently adjudicated delinquent for a crime of violence pursuant to subdivision 22-1-2(9), sex offense pursuant to \u00a7 22-24B-1, felony sexual registry offense pursuant to chapter 22-24B, or burglary in the second degree pursuant to \u00a7 22-32-3; or the court finds from evidence presented at the dispositional hearing or from the pre-dispositional report that the youth presents a significant risk of physical harm to another person. Any finding made pursuant to this section shall be made in the written decree. Section 21. Any child required to participate in a community service program is not an agent or employee of the recipients of these services. Any recipient of community service, described in \u00a7\u00a7 26-8C-7 and 26-8B-6, does not have to provide the child with unemployment compensation insurance pursuant to title 61 nor with workers' compensation insurance pursuant to title 62. Each recipient and the recipient's officers, agents, and employees are immune from any cause of action for civil damages brought by the child, parents, guardians, or any third party if the cause of action arises from any act of commission or omission by the recipient or any of its officers, agents, or employees or any act of commission or omission by the child and the acts arise out of or are in connection with a community service program, except if the cause of action is the result of gross negligence or willful and wanton misconduct of the recipient or its officers, agents, or employees and except to the extent that the recipient has purchased liability insurance. Nothing in this section relieves any individual child from responsibility for the child's individual acts. Section 22. If a judge orders more than fourteen days of detention in a thirty-day period pursuant to \u00a7 26-8C-7 or 26-8B-6, the court shall enter findings of fact and conclusions of law to include in the dispositional decree justifying the need for extended detention. Section 23. That \u00a7 26-8C-14 be amended to read as follows: 26-8C-14. The terms, and conditions, and duration of probation of a delinquent child shall be specified by rules or orders of the court and by court services officers. The duration of juvenile probation shall be specified by order of the court but may not exceed four months unless: (1) The child is placed in the intensive juvenile probation program; or (2) The child's probation is extended as provided under this section. If the child is placed on intensive juvenile probation, the duration of probation upon order by the court may be up to eight months. If the child is placed on juvenile probation, a court services officer may request two extensions up to four months each or one extension up to four months for intensive juvenile probation. The court may authorize the same in accordance with Unified Judicial System procedure if the extension is necessary for the child to engage in evidence-based treatment as required by the case plan. If evidence-based treatment is not available, an extension may be granted if the youth is engaged in alternative court-approved treatment that will not be completed before the previously ordered term of probation expires. The total duration of probation, including juvenile intensive probation and any extension may not exceed twelve months unless the court provides written authorization to allow a child to complete evidence-based treatment that will not be completed before probation expires. Probation may not be extended solely to collect restitution. If probation is terminated with restitution owing, the Unified Judicial System procedure may govern the collection. Each child placed on probation shall be given a written statement of the terms and conditions of probation, and the probation extension policy. The terms and conditions, as well as the probation extension policy, shall be fully explained to the child. The court shall review the terms and conditions of probation and the progress of each child placed on probation at least once every six four months. The court may release a child from probation or modify the terms and conditions of the child's probation at any time, but any child who has complied satisfactorily with the terms, conditions, and duration of probation shall be released from probation and the jurisdiction of the court terminated. If the duration of probation previously prescribed has expired, the court shall release the child from probation and terminate jurisdiction. Section 24. The Unified Judicial System shall report semiannually to the oversight council: (1) The number of juvenile probation admissions; (2) The number of juveniles for whom a request for extension is made; (3) The number and percent of juveniles for whom extensions are granted; (4) The number of requests for extension; (5) The number and percent of requests granted; (6) The reason for discharge and length of probation for juveniles discharged from supervision; and (7) The recidivism rate. The Unified Judicial System shall report semiannually to the oversight council the number of children placed in a detention facility pursuant to subdivisions 26-8C-7(5) and 26-8B-6(3) and the duration of each detention stay. The Unified Judicial System shall report semiannually to the oversight council the number of children eligible for informal adjustment and informal action pursuant to section 3 of this Act, and the number and percent of children for whom good cause is found for the state's attorney to proceed on a petition if the child is otherwise eligible for informal adjustment and informal action pursuant to section 3 of this Act. The Unified Judicial System shall report semiannually to the oversight council the number of children summoned to court on a juvenile cited violation pursuant to section 37 of this Act, the number of children summoned to court on a juvenile cited violation referred for informal adjustment and informal action pursuant to section 38 of this Act, and the number petitioned under section 38 of this Act. Section 25. That chapter 26-7A be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: The Supreme Court shall establish rules, pursuant to \u00a7 16-3-1, to develop a graduated sanctions and incentives procedure and grid to guide court services officers in determining the appropriate response to a violation of terms or conditions of probation in juvenile cases. If the graduated sanctions program includes detention, a stay may not exceed forty-eight hours, and may not exceed twenty-four hours for children in need of supervision pursuant to \u00a7 26-8B-3. The Unified Judicial System shall collect data related to the use of sanctions, grid compliance and program outcomes, and shall include a process for reviewing sanctions that are challenged by the juvenile. The system of graduated sanctions shall be created with the following objectives: (1) Responding to violations of probation quickly, consistently, and proportionally; (2) Reducing the time and resources expended by the court to respond to violations; and (3) Reducing the likelihood of a new delinquent act. Section 26. The Unified Judicial System shall report semiannually to the oversight council the number and percent of juvenile probationers who received a graduated response, the number and percent of juvenile probationers receiving a formal allegation of a probation violation, the number and percent of juveniles whose probation is revoked, and the action taken as a result of the revocation. Section 27. That \u00a7 26-8C-15 be amended to read as follows: 26-8C-15. The following provisions apply if the child is alleged to have violated the terms and conditions of probation and a formal allegation of a probation violation is filed: (1) The court shall set a hearing on the alleged violation and shall give five days' notice to the child, to the child's parents, guardian, or custodian, and to any other parties to the proceedings; (2) The child and the child's parents, guardian, or custodian shall be given a written statement concerning the alleged violation; (3) The child may be represented by legal counsel at the probation violation hearing and the child is entitled to the issuance of compulsory process for the attendance of witnesses; (4) If the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the child violated the terms and conditions of probation, the court may modify the terms and conditions of probation, revoke probation, or take other action as permitted by this chapter or chapter 26-7A which is in the best interests of the child and the public, except commitment to the Department of Corrections. The court may only commit a child to the Department of Corrections if the court finds that the violation committed constitutes a new law violation and finds that the aggravated circumstances as provided in subdivision 26-8C-7(9) exist; (5) For the purposes of this section, new law violation is defined as delinquent behavior pursuant to \u00a7 26-8C-2, a Class 1 misdemeanor violation of title 32, or a violation of \u00a7 32-23-21; and (6) If the court finds that the child did not violate the terms and conditions of probation as alleged, the court shall dismiss the proceedings and continue the child on probation under the terms and, conditions, and duration previously prescribed. If the duration of probation previously prescribed has expired, the court shall release the child from probation and terminate jurisdiction. Section 28. That \u00a7 26-8B-1 be amended to read as follows: 26-8B-1. It is the purpose of this chapter, in conjunction with chapter 26-7A, to establish an effective state and local system for children in need of supervision, including a focus on community-based rehabilitation. Section 29. That \u00a7 26-8B-6 be amended to read as follows: 26-8B-6. If a child has been adjudicated as a child in need of supervision, the court shall enter a decree of disposition according to the least restrictive alternative available in keeping with the best interests of the child. The decree shall contain one or more of the following alternatives: (1) The court may place the child on probation pursuant to \u00a7 26-8B-8 or under protective supervision in the custody of one or both parents, guardian, custodian, relative, or another suitable person under conditions imposed by the court; (2) The court may require as a condition of probation that the child report for assignment to participate in a supervised work community service program, provided the child is not placed in a detention facility and is not deprived of the schooling that is appropriate to the child's age, needs, and specific rehabilitative goals. The supervised work community service program shall be of a constructive nature designed to promote rehabilitation, shall be appropriate to the age level and physical ability of the child, and shall be combined with counseling by a court services officer or other guidance personnel. The supervised work community service program assignment shall be made for a period of time consistent with the child's best interests, but may not exceed ninety days; (3) If the court finds that the child has violated a valid court order, the court may place the child in a detention facility for not more than ninety days, which may be in addition to any period of temporary custody, for purposes of disposition if: (a) The child is not deprived of the schooling that is appropriate for the child's age, needs, and specific rehabilitative goals; (b) The child had a due process hearing before the order was issued; and (c) A plan of disposition from a court services officer is provided to the court; (4) The court may require the child to pay for any damage done to property or for medical expenses under conditions set by the court if payment can be enforced without serious hardship or injustice to the child; (5) The court may commit the child to the Department of Corrections for placement in a juvenile correctional facility, foster home, group home, group care center, residential treatment center, or other community-based services, if those community-based services were not provided prior to commitment, pursuant to chapter 26-11A. Prior to placement in a juvenile correctional facility, an interagency team comprised of representatives from the Department of Human Services, Department of Social Services, Department of Education, the Department of Corrections, and the Unified Judicial System shall make a written finding that placement at a Department of Corrections facility is the least restrictive placement commensurate with the best interests of the child. Subsequent placement in any other Department of Corrections facility may be authorized without an interagency review; (6) The court may place a child in an alternative educational program; (7)(6) The court may order the child to be examined and treated at the Human Services Center; (8)(7) The court may impose a fine not to exceed five hundred dollars; (9)(8) The court may order the suspension or revocation of the child's right to apply for a driving privilege, suspend or revoke an existing driving privilege, or restrict the privilege in such manner as the court sees fit or as required by \u00a7 32-12-52.4, including requiring that financial responsibility be proved and maintained; (10)(9) The court may assess or charge the same costs and fees as permitted by \u00a7\u00a7 16-2-41, 23-3-52, 23A-27-26, 23A-28B-42, and 23A-27-27 against the child, parent, guardian, custodian, or other party responsible for the child; or (10) The court may only commit a child to the Department of Corrections if the judge finds that: (a) No viable alternatives exist; (b) The Department of Corrections is the least restrictive alternative; and (c) The court finds from evidence presented at the dispositional hearing or from the pre-dispositional report that the youth presents a significant risk of physical harm to another person. Any finding made pursuant to this section shall be made in the written decree. After disposition, but prior to placement in a juvenile correctional facility, a state interagency team comprised of representatives from the Department of Human Services, the Department of Social Services, the Department of Education, the Department of Corrections, and the Unified Judicial System shall make a written finding that placement at a Department of Corrections facility is the least restrictive placement commensurate with the best interests of the child. Subsequent placement in any other Department of Corrections facility may be authorized without an interagency review. No adjudicated child in need of supervision may be incarcerated in a detention facility except as provided in subdivision (3) or (5) (10) of this section. Section 30. That \u00a7 26-8B-8 be amended to read as follows: 26-8B-8. The terms, and conditions, and duration of probation of a child in need of supervision shall be specified by rules or orders of the court and by a court services officer. The duration of juvenile probation shall be specified by order of the court but may not exceed four months unless: (1) The child is placed in the intensive juvenile probation program; or (2) The child's probation is extended as provided under this section. If the child is placed on intensive juvenile probation, the duration of probation ordered by the court may be up to eight months. If the child is placed on juvenile probation, a court services officer may request two extensions up to four months each or one extension up to four months for intensive juvenile probation. The court may authorize the same in accordance with Unified Judicial System procedure if the extension is necessary for the child to complete evidence-based treatment as required by the case plan. If evidence-based treatment is not available, an extension may be granted if the youth is engaged in alternative court-approved treatment that will not be completed before the previously ordered term of probation expires. The total duration of probation, including juvenile intensive probation and extensions in all cases, may not exceed twelve months unless the court provides written authorization to allow a child to complete evidence-based treatment that will not be completed before probation expires. Probation may not be extended solely to collect restitution. If probation is terminated with restitution owing, Unified Judicial System procedure may govern the collection. Each child placed on probation shall be given a written statement of the terms and conditions of probation and the probation policy. The terms and conditions, as well as the probation extension policy, shall be fully explained to the child. The court shall review the terms and conditions of probation and the progress of each child placed on probation at least once every six four months. The court may release a child from probation or modify the terms and conditions of the child's probation at any time, but any child who has complied satisfactorily with the terms, conditions, and duration of probation shall be released from probation and the jurisdiction of the court terminated. If the duration of probation previously prescribed has expired, the court shall release the child from probation and terminate jurisdiction. Section 31. That \u00a7 26-8B-9 be amended to read as follows: 26-8B-9. The following provisions apply if the child is alleged to have violated the terms and conditions of probation and a formal petition is filed with the court: (1) The court shall set a hearing on the alleged violation and shall give five days' notice to the child, to the child's parents, guardian, or custodian, and to any other parties to the proceedings; (2) The child and the child's parents, guardian, or custodian shall be given a written statement concerning the alleged violation; (3) The child may be represented by legal counsel at the probation violation hearing and the child is entitled to the issuance of compulsory process for the attendance of witnesses; (4) If the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the child violated the terms and conditions of probation, the court may modify the terms and conditions of probation, revoke probation, or take other action as permitted by this chapter or chapter 26-7A, according to the least restrictive alternative which is in the best interests of the child, and the public, and the state except commitment to the Department of Corrections. The court may only commit a child to the Department of Corrections if the court finds that the violation committed constitutes a new law violation and finds that the aggravated circumstances provided in subdivision 26-8B-6(10) exist; (5) For the purposes of this section, a new law violation is defined as delinquent behavior pursuant to \u00a7 26-8C-2, a Class 1 misdemeanor violation of title 32, or a violation of \u00a7 32-23-21; and (6) If the court finds that the child did not violate the terms and conditions of probation as alleged, the court shall dismiss the proceedings and continue the child on probation under the terms and, conditions, and duration previously prescribed. If the duration of probation previously prescribed has expired, the court shall release the child from probation and terminate jurisdiction. Section 32. The Department of Corrections, pursuant to the provisions of chapter 26-11A and \u00a7 26-8C-7 or 26-8B-6, may place a child in a group care center operated and maintained by a nonstate entity only in accordance with a performance-based reimbursement rate structure as provided in the provider contract and as provided by this section. If a provider is able to substantially accomplish the treatment goals and release a child from group care within the performance expectation period, a performance-based reimbursement payment shall be included in the payment allocation. The maximum performance-based reimbursement payment shall be allocated when a provider is able to substantially accomplish the treatment goals and release a child within three months. A diminished performance-based reimbursement payment shall be allocated when a provider is able to substantially accomplish the treatment goals and release a child in more than three months but less than four months. The performance-based reimbursement payment is in addition to the provider reimbursement rate as established by the Department of Social Services. The Department of Corrections shall determine the need for placement in a group care facility upon admission and review the placement monthly thereafter. Upon finding that the child is no longer in need of placement, the child shall be released to aftercare pursuant to \u00a7 26-11A-12. If the child cannot be released to aftercare at no fault of the provider, a performance-based reimbursement payment shall be added to the payment allocation as long as the provider otherwise qualifies for that payment. If a provider terminates a child prior to substantial completion of the treatment goals and the Department of Corrections transfers the child to another facility, the transferring provider does not qualify for a performance-based payment under this section for that child. Juvenile corrections facilities maintained and operated by the Department of Corrections shall design and operate programs to achieve substantial accomplishment of treatment goals and the release to aftercare within three months. Specialized transition services are exempt from the performance-based reimbursement rate structure. After January 1, 2019, the Department of Corrections may promulgate rules, pursuant to chapter 1-26, to continue or create additional or alternative performance-based reimbursement period timeframes. Section 33. The Department of Corrections, pursuant to the provisions of chapter 26-11A and \u00a7 26-8C-7 or 26-8B-6, may place a child in a residential treatment center or intensive residential treatment center only in accordance with a performance-based reimbursement rate structure as provided in the provider contract and provided by this section. If a provider is able to substantially accomplish the treatment goals and release a child from residential or intensive residential treatment within the performance expectation period, a performance-based reimbursement payment shall be added to the payment allocation. For those providers that substantially meet the treatment goals and release within three months, a maximum performance-based reimbursement payment shall be added to the payment allocation. For those providers that substantially meet the treatment goals and release within five, seven, or nine months, a diminished performance-based reimbursement payment, which decreases as length of stay increases, shall be added to the payment allocation. The provider contracts shall provide how the Department of Corrections may use state general fund dollars in the performance expectation allocation. The performance-based reimbursement payment is in addition to the provider reimbursement rate as established by the Department of Social Services. The Department of Corrections shall evaluate monthly the need for continued placement in a residential treatment center or intensive residential treatment center. Upon a finding that the child is no longer in need of placement, the child shall be released to aftercare pursuant to \u00a7 26-11A-12 or specialized transition services. If the child cannot be released to aftercare at no fault of the provider, a performance-based reimbursement payment shall be added to the payment allocation as long as the provider otherwise qualifies for that payment. If a provider terminates a child prior to substantial completion of the treatment goals and the Department of Corrections transfers the child to another facility, the transferring provider does not qualify for additional performance-based reimbursement payment under this section for that child. After January 1, 2019, the Department of Corrections may promulgate rules, pursuant to chapter 1-26, to continue or create additional or alternative performance-based reimbursement period timeframes. Section 34. The Department of Corrections shall report semiannually to the oversight council the number of children committed, number of recommitments, the average length of stay in residential placement in total and by provider, and average length of commitment among children discharged from the Department of Corrections. Section 35. That \u00a7 26-11A-15 be amended to read as follows: 26-11A-15. If the independent hearing officer finds probable cause that the terms and conditions of aftercare have been violated by committing an act subject to transfer proceedings pursuant to \u00a7 26-11-3.1, a crime of violence pursuant to subdivision 22-1-2(9), sex offense pursuant to \u00a7 22-24B-1, felony sexual registry offense pursuant to chapter 22-24B, or burglary in the second degree pursuant to \u00a7 22-32-3; or that the juvenile presents a significant risk of physical harm to another person and has committed a new law violation, an aftercare revocation hearing shall be held before a member of the Board of Pardons and Paroles created in \u00a7 24-13-1 within thirty days of the temporary detention or shelter hearing. For the purposes of this section, a new law violation is defined as delinquent behavior pursuant to \u00a7 26-8B-2, a Class 1 misdemeanor violation of title 32, or a violation of \u00a7 32-23-21. The juvenile, with the consent of a parent, guardian, or custodian, has the right to waive this hearing at any time after the juvenile is detained and after advisement that waiver of the right to appear before the Board of Pardons and Paroles may result in the juvenile being returned to placement. If the hearing officer does not find probable cause that the terms and conditions of aftercare have been violated by committing an act subject to transfer proceedings pursuant to \u00a7 26-11-3.1, a crime of violence pursuant to subdivision 22-1-2(9), sex offense pursuant to \u00a7 22-24B-1, felony sexual registry offense pursuant to chapter 22-24B, or burglary in the second degree pursuant to \u00a7 22-32-3; or that the juvenile presents a significant and likely risk of physical harm to another person and has committed a new law violation, the juvenile shall be returned to aftercare or released. The member of the board shall set the aftercare revocation hearing and shall give five days notice to the juvenile, to the juvenile's parents, guardian, or custodian, and to any other parties to the hearing. The juvenile and the juvenile's parents, guardian, or custodian, shall be given a written statement of the allegations against the juvenile. The juvenile shall have the opportunity to appear in person, present witnesses, or documentary evidence in the juvenile's behalf, and cross-examine witnesses unless the member of the board makes a written determination that doing so is not in the best interests of the juvenile. The juvenile may be represented by legal counsel at the hearing. Section 36. The Department of Corrections shall report semiannually to the oversight council the number and percent of juveniles violating aftercare, the number and percent of juveniles whose aftercare is revoked, and the action taken as a result of the revocation. Section 37. That chapter 26-7A be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: The following allegations of delinquency and children in need of supervision shall be treated as juvenile cited violations by law enforcement: (1) Petty theft in the second degree pursuant to \u00a7 22-30A-17.3; (2) Intentional damage to property, four hundred dollars or less, pursuant to \u00a7 22-34-1; (3) Purchase, possession, or consumption of alcoholic beverage by person under twenty-one years pursuant to \u00a7 35-9-2 in accordance with subdivision 26-8B-2(5); and (4) Truancy pursuant to subdivision 26-8B-2(1). The issuing officer shall notify the child and the child's parent, guardian, or custodian that a hearing on the complaint for a cited violation shall be held before a judicial circuit court judge within ten days of issuance of the summons or on the next available court date and be treated as a confidential juvenile matter. The hearing shall be held pursuant to \u00a7 26-7A-36 and the case records shall be treated as confidential consistent with the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 26-7A-114, 26-7A-115, 26-7A-116, 26-7A-120, and 26-7A-27. A cited violation is not an adjudication or a child in need of supervision or delinquency proceeding. Section 38. That chapter 26-7A be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: When a state's attorney is informed that a complaint has been issued for a juvenile cited violation, the state's attorney may take any action permitted pursuant to \u00a7 26-7A-10, except that a state's attorney may only file a petition pursuant to subdivision 26-7A-10(5) if: (1) The child is cited pursuant to subdivisions (1) and (2) of section 37 of this Act; or (2) The child is cited pursuant to subdivisions (3) and (4) of section 37 of this Act, and has two or more prior judgments for the same violation. Section 39. That chapter 26-7A be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: If the state's attorney elects to proceed on the complaint pursuant to subdivision 26-7A-10(3), the child shall be asked for an admission or denial of the alleged violation. If the child admits to the violation, the court shall accept the admission and enter a judgment pursuant to section 40 of this Act. If the child denies committing the violation, the case may be tried according to procedure adopted by the presiding judge of each judicial circuit and approved by the Supreme Court, but a jury trial may not be granted. If the child fails to appear in court at the time set in the summons or set by subsequent postponement, the court may either issue a new summons to appear and set a new date for hearing to show cause, or the court may consider that failure to appear constitutes an admission to the allegations contained in the complaint and may accordingly enter a judgment for payment. If the child fails to comply with the terms of the judgment, the court may either issue a summons to appear and show cause, or issue a forfeiture against the child's parents or guardians for the amount of the citation and any restitution owed pursuant to section 40 of this Act. Section 40. That chapter 26-7A be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: If a child is found to be in violation of the complaint, the court shall enter a judgment against the child for one or more of the following: (1) A fine and court costs not to exceed one hundred dollars; (2) Restitution as determined appropriate by the court; or (3) Suspension or revocation of the child's driving privilege if the judgment is entered on a violation pursuant to subdivision (3) of section 37 of this Act. The court may set a hearing to review compliance with the judgment. If a child is unable to pay a fine, court costs, or restitution as ordered by the court, any party may request that the court order community service in lieu of the monetary judgment. At no time shall a court order a child to probation or detention upon entry of a judgment on a cited violation. A judgment on a cited violation shall be a confidential matter pursuant to subsection 15-15A-7(p). Section 41. That chapter 23-1A be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: The attorney general may revise the uniform traffic ticket created pursuant to chapter 23-1A to be used for juvenile cited violations. Section 42. The juvenile justice detention cost-sharing fund is hereby created in the Department of Corrections for the purpose of assisting counties with increased costs due to increased juvenile detention expenses paid by counties. Section 43. Any county that provides the Department of Corrections with documentation showing juvenile detention bed days paid by the county for calendar years 2013, 2014, and 2015 by March 1, 2016, is considered a participating county. All other counties are nonparticipating counties. A nonparticipating county may become a participating county in subsequent years by submitting the data in this section and complying with the requirements in section 44 of this Act. Section 44. Beginning on March 1, 2017, and March first of each year thereafter, each participating county shall submit to the Department of Corrections the number of juvenile detention bed days paid by the county in the preceding calendar year. Only a participating county is eligible for reimbursement from the juvenile justice detention cost-sharing fund. The participating counties shall be determined on an annual basis. Section 45. The Department of Corrections shall compare the number of detention bed days each county paid in the preceding calendar year to the average number of detention bed days paid in calendar years 2013, 2014, and 2015. If the days paid in the calendar year in question exceed the average, the Department of Corrections shall pay the county two hundred dollars per day for each day exceeding the average. If the amount owed the participating counties exceeds the amount of money in the fund, the amount reimbursed per bed day shall be prorated to fulfill all requests. Section 46. Sections 42 to 45, inclusive, of this Act, are repealed on June 30, 2019, and any remaining moneys in the juvenile justice detention cost-sharing fund shall be transferred to the general fund. Section 47. Sections 14 to 18, inclusive, sections 23 to 27, inclusive, sections 29 to 33, inclusive, sections 37 to 41, inclusive, and sections 7, 20, and 35 of this Act are effective on January 1, 2016."},
