BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 3-24-1 be amended to read: 3-24-1. There is hereby created a State Government Accountability Board to be composed of four members appointed by the Governor. Each member to be appointed shall be a former or retired circuit court judge or Supreme Court Justice. No more than two of the appointed members may be of the same political party. All appointees are subject to confirmation by the Senate and no appointee may be a member of the Legislature during the member's term on the board. The term for a board member is five years and a board member may only be removed for good cause. Good cause to remove a member is conduct such as: malfeasance or misfeasance in office, neglect of duty, corrupt conduct, gross incompetency, or active partisanship. A vacancy in the board's membership shall be filled by the Governor within thirty days of the event causing the vacancy. If a vacancy occurs before a term expires, the new member shall serve for the remaining portion of the unexpired term. If the Senate is not in session at the time the appointment is made, the appointee may serve until the Senate has the opportunity to consider the appointment. The per diem and expenses of the board are the same as the per diem and expenses for members of interim committees of the Legislature. The Governor may appoint a temporary board member if a member is recused or otherwise unavailable to participate. A temporary appointment is not subject to confirmation by the Senate."}, {"bill_id": 9615, "bill_version_id": 53484, "bill_version": "Enrolled", "bill_version_date": "2019-02-12T09:25:13.053-06:00",
