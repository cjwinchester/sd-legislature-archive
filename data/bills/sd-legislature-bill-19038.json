Once a person is a family member subsequent events such as death or divorce, do not disqualify that person from being a family member under this chapter. Section 2. That \u00a7 47-9A-14 be amended to read as follows: 47-9A-14. As used in this chapter, unless the context otherwise plainly requires, \"family farm corporation\" the term, family farm corporation, means a any corporation founded for the purpose of farming and the ownership of agricultural land in which the majority of the voting stock is held by the majority of the stockholders who are members of a family related to each other within the third degree of kindred, and at least one of whose stockholders is a person who is residing on or actively operating the farm or who has resided on or has actively operated the farm, and none of whose stockholders are corporations, or a corporation founded for the purpose of farming and the ownership of agricultural land in which a majority of the voting stock is held by resident stockholders who are family farmers and are actively engaged in farming as their primary economic activity. However, a family farm corporation does not cease to qualify as such hereunder by reason of any devise or bequest of shares of voting stock or by reason of any gift of shares of voting stock to any person who is entitled to inherit from the donor if the donor were to die intestate members of a family, an estate of a family member, or a trust that benefits members of the family, and at least one of whose stockholders is a person who is residing on or actively operating the farm or who has resided on or has actively operated the farm, and none of whose stockholders are corporations.
