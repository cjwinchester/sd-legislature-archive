Upon receiving a complaint regarding the health or safety of any patient or the public, any authorized board member, officer, or agent may enter and inspect, during business hours, any place where marriage and family therapy is practiced for the purpose of enforcing the provisions of this chapter.

Testimony or documentary evidence of any kind obtained by the board during the investigation of a complaint is not subject to discovery or disclosure under chapter 15-6 or under any other provision of law and is not admissible as evidence in any legal proceeding, unless the complaint becomes a contested case under chapter 1-26.
