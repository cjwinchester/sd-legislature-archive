Miller into the PRCA Rodeo Hall of Fame. WHEREAS, South Dakota has dominated the sport of professional saddle bronc riding since its inception from the first great champion, Earl Thode, through the incomparable Casey Tibbs, to the charismatic Etbauer brothers, and on to the current generation well represented by Jeff Willert, Jesse Bail, and Chad Ferly; and WHEREAS, in all that proud tradition no name shines brighter and no personality rings truer than the character and integrity personified by Tom C. Miller; and WHEREAS, Tom is a true son of the South Dakota prairie and the lonesome grasslands of rural Meade County; and WHEREAS, Tom was the trail boss of a rowdy, but successful Black Hills State College team that deadsolid dominated national collegiate rodeo competition in the early seventies; and WHEREAS, Tom was the perpetual and unchallenged all-around collegiate cowboy working both ends of the area with equal facility and often outscoring, by himself, most of the other teams entered at a competition; and WHEREAS, Tom possessed the consummate athleticism and determination to excel in all three roughstock events and could have professionally pursued any of the three with extraordinary success; and WHEREAS, Tom, nevertheless, chose to concentrate his career on saddle bronc riding with such singular consistency that he qualified for the National Finals Rodeo six times and won the average against the best in the world an incredible three times; and WHEREAS, like the legendarily talented Phil Lyne, there is no telling what an impact Tom might have had on rodeo's record book if he had not always put family and ranch first and kept the grind of the rodeo circuit in perspective; and WHEREAS, Tom never refused to encourage and coach less talented aspirants, to maintain a calm and restrained demeanor in the midst of the chaos behind the chutes, and to refrain from any rowdy behaviors of the kind that might have been detrimental to the best image of the sport; and WHEREAS, the Selection Committee of the Pro Rodeo Hall of Fame, through their nomination of Tom, has the opportunity to honor one of the most talented and deserving bronc riders that ever measured a bronc rein or nodded for a gate; and WHEREAS, Tom's induction would also honor a high plains ranch lifestyle and a set of solid values that, growing from the South Dakota sod, are as relevant today to a life well lived as at any time in the history of our nation: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the House of Representatives of the Eighty-Eighth Legislature of the State of South Dakota, that the House of Representatives of the Legislature of the State of South Dakota heartily and without reservation endorses the induction of Tom C. Miller into the PRCA Hall of Fame."}, {"bill_id": 4358, "bill_version_id": 24928, "bill_version": "Enrolled", "bill_version_date": "2013-01-29T14:55:16.437-06:00", "bill_text": ""}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 4358, "action_date": "2013-01-28T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 24817, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/24817.pdf", "status_text": "First Reading", "journal_page": 205, "committee_id_action": 202, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 4358, "action_date": "2013-01-29T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 24922, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/24922.pdf", "status_text": "Adopt Resolution", "journal_page": 234, "committee_id_action": 202, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 13104, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [420, 346, 415, 418, 326, 360, 417, 349, 382, 410, 412, 398, 342, 324, 348, 318, 397, 374, 402, 381, 396, 370, 394, 413, 372, 350, 347, 416, 389, 351, 344, 359, 392, 335, 369, 414, 400, 375, 371, 380, 316, 332, 393, 395, 390, 404, 405, 356, 411, 377, 355, 378, 407, 352, 357, 403, 343, 399, 323, 406, 361, 391, 354, 409, 401, 373, 353, 341, 334], "Excused": [408]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/4358"}
