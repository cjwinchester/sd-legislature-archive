A commercial driver license issued pursuant to this chapter, expires on the licensee's birthday in the fifth year following the issuance of the license. Any nonresident commercial driver license expires on the date of expiration of the applicant's authorized stay in the United States as determined by the systematic alien verification for entitlements system or alternate method approved by the United States Department of Homeland Security or, if there is no expiration date, for a period no longer than one year from date of issuance. However, no nonresident commercial driver license may expire on a date later than the licensee's birthday in the fifth year following the issuance of the license."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 3324, "action_date": "2012-01-23T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 19948, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/19948.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 154, "committee_id_action": 173, "committee_id_assigned": 166, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 3324, "action_date": "2012-02-13T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 21180, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/21180.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 166, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 3324, "action_date": "2012-02-13T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 21303, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/21303.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to the 41st legislative day", "journal_page": 427, "committee_id_action": 166, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 11525, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [222, 262, 260, 268, 245, 266, 267, 215, 244, 300, 269, 246], "Excused": [270]}}, {"bill_id": 3324, "action_date": "2012-02-13T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 21373, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/21373.pdf", "status_text": "Recalled from committee (Rule 7-7)", "journal_page": 430, "committee_id_action": 173, "committee_id_assigned": 166, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 11575, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [222, 262, 265, 227, 242, 231, 281, 269, 296, 314, 260, 225, 268, 245, 303, 313, 293, 270, 266, 221, 248, 246, 304, 267, 294, 213, 311, 277, 307, 315, 278, 259, 216, 283, 244, 306, 238, 309, 300, 298, 274, 256, 215], "Yea": [211, 257, 258, 217, 297, 299, 272, 279, 305, 271, 263, 230, 280, 301, 237, 241, 276, 308, 273, 282, 224, 295, 302, 310, 275], "Excused": [292, 312]}}, {"bill_id": 3324, "action_date": "2012-02-13T17:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 21380, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/21380.pdf", "status_text": "Reconsidered", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 166, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 11584, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [222, 262, 260, 268, 245, 270, 266, 267, 244, 300, 269, 246], "Excused": [215]}}, {"bill_id": 3324, "action_date": "2012-02-13T17:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 21380, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/21380.pdf", "status_text": "Do Not Pass", "journal_page": 450, "committee_id_action": 166, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 11585, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [222, 262, 260, 268, 245, 270, 266, 267, 244, 300, 269, 246], "Excused": [215]}}, {"bill_id": 3324, "action_date": "2012-02-14T13:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 21460, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/21460.pdf", "status_text": "Motion to strike the \"Not\"", "journal_page": 457, "committee_id_action": 173, "committee_id_assigned": 166, "result": "F", "vote": {"vote_id": 11638, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [222, 265, 227, 242, 231, 281, 269, 296, 211, 314, 260, 258, 225, 268, 245, 313, 293, 270, 266, 221, 248, 246, 292, 304, 267, 294, 213, 311, 277, 307, 308, 315, 278, 259, 216, 283, 244, 238, 309, 300, 298, 274, 256, 215], "Yea": [262, 257, 217, 303, 297, 299, 272, 279, 305, 271, 263, 230, 280, 301, 237, 312, 241, 276, 273, 282, 224, 295, 302, 306, 310, 275]}}]}
