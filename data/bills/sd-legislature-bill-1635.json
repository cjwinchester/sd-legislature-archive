The department shall deny registration for a vehicle assigned to a motor carrier that has been taken out of service by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration for safety reasons, or a carrier whose business is operated, managed, or otherwise controlled or affiliated with a person who is ineligible for registration, including the applicant, owner, relative, corporate officer, or shareholder.
