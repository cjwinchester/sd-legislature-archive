Any individual applying for an individual navigator registration shall apply to the director on a form developed by the director which, unless preempted by federal law, is accompanied by the initial registration fee of fifty dollars. The individual shall declare in the application under penalty of refusal, suspension, or revocation of the license that the statements made in the application are true, correct, and complete to the best of the individual's knowledge and belief. The director may require any documents deemed necessary to verify the information contained in an application. Section 7. An entity applying for an entity navigator registration shall make application on a form developed by the director and which contains the information prescribed by the director and which, unless preempted by federal law, is accompanied by the initial entity registration fee of one hundred dollars. The director may require any documents deemed necessary to verify the information contained in an application. A registered navigator shall, in a manner prescribed by the director, notify the director within thirty days of any federal action that restricts or terminates the navigator's authorization to act as a navigator. Section 8. A registered entity navigator shall, in a manner prescribed by the director, provide the director with a list of all individual navigators that it employs, supervises, or is affiliated with. Section 9. The registration of an individual navigator and entity navigator expires one year after the date of issuance. An individual navigator may file an application for renewal of a registration on a form developed by the director and, unless preempted by federal law, shall pay the renewal fee of twenty-five dollars. An individual navigator who fails to file prior to the expiration of the current registration for registration renewal, unless preempted by federal law, shall pay a late fee of fifty dollars.

On contact with any person who acknowledges having existing health insurance coverage obtained through a licensed insurance producer, a navigator shall make a reasonable effort to inform the individual that he or she may, but is not required to, seek further assistance from that producer or another licensed producer for information, assistance, and any other services and that tax credits may not be available to offset the premium cost of plans that are marketed outside of the exchange. Section 11. The director, after notice and hearing, may place on probation, suspend, revoke, or refuse to issue, renew, or reinstate a navigator registration for violation of the Health Insurance Exchange Navigator Registration Act. Except as otherwise provided by law, the director may examine and investigate the business affairs and records of any navigator as such business affairs and records regard the navigator's duties as a navigator to determine whether the navigator has engaged or is engaging in any violation of the Health Insurance Exchange Navigator Registration Act. An entity navigator registration may be suspended or revoked or renewal or reinstatement thereof may be refused if the director finds, after notice and hearing, that an individual navigator's violation was known by the employing or supervising entity navigator and the violation was not reported to the director and no corrective action was undertaken. Section 12. The director may adopt and promulgate rules and regulations, pursuant to chapter 1-26, concerning the following areas for navigators: (1) Application and registration procedures; (2) Instruction and continuing education; and (3) Examination testing. Section 13. Whereas, this Act is necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, or safety, an emergency is hereby declared to exist, and this Act shall be in full force and effect from and after its passage and approval."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 5372, "action_date": "2014-01-29T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 29336, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/29336.pdf", "status_text": "First read in Senate and referred to", "journal_page": 156, "committee_id_action": 229, "committee_id_assigned": 206, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 5372, "action_date": "2014-02-20T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 30523, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/30523.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 206, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 5372, "action_date": "2014-02-20T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 30684, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/30684.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 206, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "F", "vote": {"vote_id": 16335, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [469, 465], "Nay": [473, 470, 847, 438], "Excused": [452]}}, {"bill_id": 5372, "action_date": "2014-02-20T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 30684, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/30684.pdf", "status_text": "Tabled", "journal_page": 380, "committee_id_action": 206, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 16336, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [469, 465], "Yea": [473, 470, 847, 438], "Excused": [452]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/5372"}
