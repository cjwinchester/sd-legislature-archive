BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 10-52-3 be amended to read as follows: 10-52-3. Any tax imposed by the governing board of any municipality pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, may be referred to a vote of the people for its approval or disapproval in the same manner as provided in \u00a7 \u00a7 9-20-7, 9-20-8, and 9-20-10. A tax imposed by municipal ordinance which was in effect on December 31, 2003 2005 , is continued under the provisions of this chapter if: (1) The governing board of the municipality has reviewed the existing tax ordinance to determine compliance with the provisions of this chapter; and (2) The governing board of the municipality documents the review, any amendment, and the intent to continue the tax in the official minutes of the governing board. Any amendment made by the municipality to comply with the provisions of chapter 10-45C, \u00a7 \u00a7 10-1-44.3, 10-45-1 to 10-45-1.4, inclusive, 10-45-2.3, 10-45-3, 10-45-3.4, 10-45-5, 10-45-5.3, 10-45-8, 10-45-24, 10-45-30, 10-45-61, 10-45-108 and 10-45-109, 10-46-1, 10-46-17.6, 10-52-2, 10-52-2.10, 10-52-3, 10-52-9, 10-52-13 to 10-52-16, inclusive, and 10-59-27 or the determination to continue the tax under the provisions of this chapter is deemed to be an administrative decision pursuant to \u00a7 9-20-19 and is not subject to referendum. Section 2. That \u00a7 10-52-2.10 be amended to read as follows: 10-52-2.10. Any incorporated municipality imposing a non-ad valorem tax in accordance with \u00a7 10-52-2 may issue municipal non-ad valorem tax revenue bonds pursuant to this section and chapter 6-8B in anticipation of the collection of the taxes. The bonds shall be payable solely from the collections of the taxes imposed by the municipality under \u00a7 10-52-2, as determined by the governing body. The governing body shall, in the resolution or ordinance authorizing the bonds, agree that it will continue to impose and collect the taxes so long as the bonds are outstanding. The governing body shall also pledge so much of the collections of the taxes as may be necessary to pay the principal premium and interest on the bonds and to maintain any debt service reserve established for the bonds. For bonds issued prior to January 1, 2004 2006 , the proceeds of the bonds may be used for land acquisition, the funding of public ambulances and medical emergency response vehicles, public hospitals or nonprofit hospitals with fifty or fewer licensed beds and other public health care facilities or nonprofit health care facilities with fifty or fewer licensed beds, capital asset acquisition and capital improvements, to establish a debt service reserve fund for the bonds and to pay not more than one year's capitalized interest on the bonds. No election is required to authorize the issuance of municipal non-ad valorem tax revenue bonds. The bonds shall be issued and sold as provided in chapter 6-8B. Section 3. That \u00a7 10-52-15 be amended to read as follows: 10-52-15. The Legislature hereby finds that the amendments to chapter 10-52 contained in SL 2002, ch 64, will result in a broader and more uniform tax base for the sales tax levied by municipalities under this chapter, and that, absent a reduction in the current tax levy of a municipality, it is anticipated that total sales tax revenues of a municipality may increase as a result of these amendments. However, so long as a municipality has any bonds or other obligations outstanding which are secured directly or indirectly by the pledge or collection and application of sales taxes levied pursuant to chapter 10-52 as in effect immediately prior to January 1, 2004 2006 , no municipality may reduce its tax levy under chapter 10-52 to a rate which, in the exercise of the sound discretion of the governing body, would be expected to produce less total revenue than was collected in the immediately preceding year. Section 4. That sections 21 and 22 of chapter 61 of the 2003 Session Laws be repealed. Section 5. Sections 1 to 4 of this Act, inclusive, are effective on April 1, 2004. Section 6. Whereas, this Act is necessary for the support of the state government and its existing public institutions, an emergency is hereby declared to exist, and this Act shall be in full force and effect from and after its passage and approval."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 18408, "action_date": "2004-01-22T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 99662, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/99662.pdf", "status_text": "First read in Senate and referred to", "journal_page": 109, "committee_id_action": 832, "committee_id_assigned": 814, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 18408, "action_date": "2004-02-09T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 100943, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/100943.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 814, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 18408, "action_date": "2004-02-09T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 100943, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/100943.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to 36th legislative day", "journal_page": 400, "committee_id_action": 814, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 57281, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [3093, 3101, 3109, 3120, 3146, 3065, 3050], "Nay": [3137, 3139]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/18408"}
