For the purposes of this Act, the term, severed mineral interest, means any property interest in the minerals deposited in any land in this state which interest is owned separately from any other fee interest to the surface of the property upon or beneath which the severed mineral interest exists. Section 2. Any severed mineral interest constitutes real property and shall be assessed in the same manner as any other real nonagricultural property. If no value may be readily determined for such severed mineral interests, a minimum valuation of five dollars per acre or fraction of an acre shall be assessed. The owner of the severed mineral interest shall pay property taxes levied for the general fund of the county and the general fund of the school district. The assessed value of the severed mineral interest and the tax imposed on the property by the county shall be considered an increase of value for the purpose of determining the amount of revenue payable from taxes on real property pursuant to \u00a7 10-13-35. The assessed value of the severed mineral interest and the tax imposed on the property by the school district shall be considered additional revenue for the general fund of the school district and that revenue is not to be included in the determination of local effort. No other property taxes may be levied on the assessed value of the severed mineral interest by the county, school district, or other taxing district. Section 3. The owner of any severed mineral interest shall, not later than November 1, 2007, file for record with the register of deeds in the county in which such severed mineral interest is located a verified statement setting forth his or her address, his or her interest, and the legal description of the property upon or beneath which the interest exists along with any other information that the register of deeds may require. Section 4. If the owner of any severed mineral interest fails to comply with the provisions of section 3 of this Act, the provisions of \u00a7 10-6-20 apply. Section 5. If the owner of any severed mineral interest fails to comply with the provisions of section 3 of this Act, any person with actual knowledge of the existence of a severed mineral interest may report the existence to the register of deeds in the county of record. Upon verification by the register of deeds of the existence of the severed mineral interest, property taxes shall be assessed against the last known owner of record of the severed mineral interest. Section 6. The county treasurer, before offering for sale for unpaid taxes as provided in \u00a7 10- 23-7 any severed mineral interest, shall notify the surface fee owner of the property from which the mineral interest was severed of the time and place of the sale and of the opportunity to purchase such severed mineral interest for the amount of unpaid taxes, penalties, and interest charged against such severed mineral interest."}, {"bill_id": 20684, "bill_version_id": 108232, "bill_version": "Senate Taxation Engrossed", "bill_version_date": "2006-02-08T12:14:05-06:00", "bill_text": "FOR AN ACT ENTITLED, An Act to clarify provisions regarding the use of railroad rights-of- way by utility companies.
