BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 41-6-18.1 be amended to read as follows: 41-6-18.1. It is a Class 2 misdemeanor for a nonresident to hunt, take, or kill migratory waterfowl without a special nonresident waterfowl license, a fall three-day temporary nonresident waterfowl license, early fall Canada goose temporary nonresident license, or a spring snow goose temporary nonresident license, a migratory bird certification permit, and a federal migratory bird stamp, or in violation of the conditions of the licenses or the rules of the Game, Fish and Parks Commission. A special nonresident waterfowl license, except as otherwise provided in this title, entitles the licensee to hunt migratory waterfowl for ten two periods of five consecutive days. Four dollars received from the sale of each special nonresident waterfowl license shall be placed in the land acquisition and development fund. The moneys from this fund shall be used to acquire by purchase or lease real property to be used primarily for game production. This license shall be in such form as the Game, Fish and Parks Commission shall prescribe. The provision in this section limiting the validity of a special nonresident waterfowl license to ten two periods of five consecutive days does not apply in Union, Clay, Bon Homme, Yankton, and Charles Mix counties; and in such counties, the special nonresident waterfowl license is valid during the same period as is a resident waterfowl license. The Game, Fish and Parks Commission may issue no more than four thousand special nonresident waterfowl licenses in a calendar year."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 3689, "action_date": "2012-01-24T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 20047, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/20047.pdf", "status_text": "First read in Senate and referred to", "journal_page": 156, "committee_id_action": 171, "committee_id_assigned": 147, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 3689, "action_date": "2012-02-02T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 20435, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/20435.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 147, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 3689, "action_date": "2012-02-02T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 20666, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/20666.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to the 41st legislative day", "journal_page": 256, "committee_id_action": 147, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 10916, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [284, 243, 240], "Excused": [255], "Yea": [250, 234, 290, 232, 223]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/3689"}
