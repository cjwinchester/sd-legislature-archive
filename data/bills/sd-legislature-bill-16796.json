BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That chapter 41-9 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: No person, except the owner or lessee of a qualifying shooting preserve or any person receiving written permission from the owner or lessee, may use the restricted portions of any highway or public right-of-way that is adjacent to the qualifying shooting preserve for purposes of hunting. For purposes of this section, the restricted portion of the highway or public right-of- way is the area between the center line of the highway or public right-of-way and the boundary of the highway or public right-of way that is adjacent to the qualified shooting preserve. A qualified shooting preserve is one that: (1) Holds an operating permit issued pursuant to chapter 41-10; (2) Can document that it releases at least six hundred male Chinese ringneck pheasants per season; and (3) Can document that no more than twenty-five percent of the pheasants harvested on the preserve are wild or unmarked birds. A qualified shooting preserve shall mark the affected boundary with signs posted at least every five hundred feet along the boundary. The signs shall be at least twelve inches high and sixteen inches wide with lettering of at least one inch or larger which shall state: \"PRESERVE AREA. IT IS UNLAWFUL TO SHOOT FROM ROADWAY WITHOUT PERMISSION.\" The commission shall promulgate rules pursuant to chapter 1-26 to provide for the documentation or verification that a shooting preserve meets the requirements of this section, to specify signs and marking standards and procedures, and to provide for the administration of the provisions of this section. Hunting in or attempting to take pheasants from properly marked areas that are restricted by the provisions of this section is a Class 2 misdemeanor. Posting or representing an area as a qualified shooting preserve if the area does not meet the requirements of this section is a Class 2 misdemeanor."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 16796, "action_date": "2002-01-15T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 92019, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/92019.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 115, "committee_id_action": 768, "committee_id_assigned": 754, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 16796, "action_date": "2002-01-29T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 93095, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/93095.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 754, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 16796, "action_date": "2002-01-29T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 93095, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/93095.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to 36th legislative day", "journal_page": 335, "committee_id_action": 754, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 53692, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [2731, 2811, 2814, 2748], "Yea": [2756, 2764, 2765, 2769, 2774, 2779, 2825], "Excused": [2807, 2786]}}]}
