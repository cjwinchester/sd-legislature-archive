The board of township supervisors shall construct, repair, and maintain all of the township roads within the township except for section lines designated as no maintenance section lines pursuant to \u00a7 31-13-1.4 and roads designated as no maintenance roads pursuant to section 2 of this Act. The township road system consists of section line roads; judicially declared roads; roads impliedly accepted by the township through routine performance of certain maintenance activities, such as grading, graveling and snow removal, and accepting funds from the county pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 32-11-4.1 and 32-11-6 for a period of at least fifteen years; and any other roads designated by resolution of the board as being on the township road system.

The board does not have any responsibility on a no maintenance road except to require removal or remediation of a manmade obstruction, if needed, to maintain the public access. Section 3.
