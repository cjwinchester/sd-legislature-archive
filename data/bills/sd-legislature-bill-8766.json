Any permanent employee of the state who is not a participant in the plan on June 30, 2019, becomes an automatic enrollee in the plan on July 1, 2019, unless the employee elects not to participate. Any other permanent employee who is not a participant in the plan and who is employed by an automatic enrollment unit that elects automatic enrollment pursuant to \u00a7 62:03:07:02.01 becomes an automatic enrollee in the plan, unless the employee elects not to participate.
