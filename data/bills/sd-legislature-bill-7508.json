He may, by appropriate action or proceeding brought in the name of the state, enforce compliance with any constitutional or legislative mandate, or restrain violation of any constitutional or legislative power, duty or right by any officer, department or agency of the state or any of its civil divisions.

The Governor shall commission all officers of the state. He may at any time require information, in writing or otherwise, from the officers of any administrative department, office or agency upon any subject relating to the respective offices. The Governor shall at the beginning of each session, and may at other times, give the Legislature information concerning the affairs of the state and recommend the measures he considers necessary. The Governor may convene the Legislature or either house thereof alone in special session by a proclamation stating the purposes of the session, and only business encompassed by such purposes shall be transacted. Whenever a vacancy occurs in the representation of South Dakota in the United States Senate, the Governor shall convene a special session of the entire Legislature. The Legislature shall, by process of voting, fill the vacancy from among the duly elected Legislators. Whenever a vacancy occurs in any office and no provision is made by the Constitution or laws for filling such vacancy, the Governor shall have the power to fill such vacancy by appointment. The Governor may, except as to convictions on impeachment, grant pardons, commutations, and reprieves, and may suspend and remit fines and forfeitures."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 7508, "action_date": "2016-02-04T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 38841, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/38841.pdf", "status_text": "First Reading House", "journal_page": 291, "committee_id_action": 325, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 7508, "action_date": "2016-02-08T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 39001, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/39001.pdf", "status_text": "Referred to", "journal_page": 322, "committee_id_action": 325, "committee_id_assigned": 317, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 7508, "action_date": "2016-02-22T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 39644, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/39644.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 317, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 7508, "action_date": "2016-02-22T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 39715, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/39715.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to the 41st legislative day", "journal_page": 476, "committee_id_action": 317, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 21267, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [1042, 983, 1022, 1002, 1044, 1024, 1003, 981, 1029, 989, 1025, 976], "Excused": [990]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/7508"}
