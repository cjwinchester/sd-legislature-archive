BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 13-13-72.1 be amended to read as follows: 13-13-72.1. Any adjustments in the levies specified in \u00a7 10-12-42 made pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 13-13-71 and 13-13-72 shall be based on maintaining the relationship between statewide local effort as a percentage of statewide local need in the fiscal year succeeding the fiscal year in which the adjustment is made. Any adjustment to the levy for agricultural property shall be based upon the change in the statewide agricultural taxable valuation and the reclassification of agricultural property to another property classification. Any adjustment to the levies for nonagricultural property and owner-occupied single-family dwellings shall be based upon the change in the statewide nonagricultural property and owner-occupied single-family dwellings taxable valuations. However, if any new project with a total taxable valuation of one hundred fifty million dollars or more is constructed, the levies shall be proportionately decreased for agricultural property, nonagricultural property, and owner-occupied single-family dwellings. In addition to the adjustments in the levies provided by this section, the levies shall also be annually adjusted as necessary to reduce the portion of local need paid by local effort by an amount equal to nine million dollars from those funds transferred into the property tax reduction fund pursuant to \u00a7 10-50-52 subsequent to July 1, 2007. In addition to the adjustments in the levies provided by this section, the levies for nonagricultural property and owner-occupied single-family dwellings shall also be adjusted as necessary to account for the additional increase in the total assessed value for nonagricultural property and owner-occupied single-family dwellings pursuant to the phasing out and repeal of the provisions provided in \u00a7 10-6-74."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 2759, "action_date": "2011-01-24T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 15455, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/15455.pdf", "status_text": "First read in Senate and referred to", "journal_page": 173, "committee_id_action": 113, "committee_id_assigned": 98, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 2759, "action_date": "2011-02-14T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 16629, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/16629.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 98, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 2759, "action_date": "2011-02-14T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 16797, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/16797.pdf", "status_text": "Tabled", "journal_page": 411, "committee_id_action": 98, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 8980, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [44, 40, 46, 24, 26, 77, 45, 9, 34]}}]}
