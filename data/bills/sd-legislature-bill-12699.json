The one-call notification center may be organized as a nonprofit corporation. The one-call notification center shall provide a service through which a person can notify the operators of underground facilities of plans to excavate and to request the marking of the facilities. All operators are subject to this chapter and the rules promulgated thereto. Any operator who knowingly fails to become a member of the one-call notification center or who fails to submit the locations of all of the operator's underground facilities to the center, as required by this chapter and rules of the board, shall be assessed a civil penalty by the board of one hundred dollars per month for each month of noncompliance up to a maximum of five hundred dollars. In addition, an operator is subject to civil liability for any damages caused by noncompliance with this chapter. Any penalties which may be assessed by the board under this chapter shall be collected as provided by law and deposited into the one-call fund. Section 2. That \u00a7 49-7A-5 be amended to read as follows: 49-7A-5. No excavator may begin any excavation without first notifying the one-call notification center of the proposed excavation.

Notice to the one-call notification center is notice to each member of the one-call notification center, except in instances when an operator directs the one-call notification center to require the excavator to personally contact the operator. In such instance the center shall furnish the excavator with information necessary to contact the operator. No member is required to accept notification more than ten business days prior to the excavation unless it is by an engineer for planning purposes for projects that may affect the underground facilities. Once notice is given it is effective for the duration of the excavation. However, if the markings made by the operator pursuant to \u00a7 49-7A-8 disappear or deteriorate to the extent that the site must be remarked, the excavator shall provide notice again as required by this chapter.

An excavator requesting an emergency locate shall provide an accessible contact for the period of the emergency to allow the operator to request additional information or to allow the operator to inform the excavator of any circumstances particular to the notice request.
