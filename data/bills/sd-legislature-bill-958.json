It does not include the unwed father where paternity has not been acknowledged or established; (12) \"Preadoptive placement,\" the temporary placement of an Indian child in a foster home or institution after the termination of parental rights, but prior to or in lieu of adoptive placement; (13) \"Reservation,\" Indian country as defined in 18 U.S.C. 1151, as in effect on January 1, 2009, and any lands, not covered under such section, title to which is either held by the United States in trust for the benefit of any Indian tribe or individual or held by any Indian tribe or individual subject to a restriction by the United States against alienation; (14) \"Secretary\" the secretary of the United States Department of the Interior; (15) \"Termination of parental rights,\" any action resulting in the termination of the parent-child relationship; (16) \"Tribal court,\" any court with jurisdiction over child custody proceedings and which is either a Court of Indian Offenses, a court established and operated under the code or custom of an Indian tribe, or any other administrative body of a tribe which is vested with authority over child custody proceedings. Section 2. An Indian tribe has jurisdiction exclusive as to any state over any child custody proceeding involving an Indian child who resides or is domiciled within the reservation of the tribe, unless the jurisdiction is otherwise vested in the state by existing federal law. If an Indian child is a ward of a tribal court, the Indian tribe retains exclusive jurisdiction, notwithstanding the residence or domicile of the child. Section 3. In any state court proceeding for the foster care placement of, or termination of parental rights to, an Indian child not domiciled or residing within the reservation of the Indian child's tribe, the court, in the absence of good cause to the contrary, shall transfer the proceeding to the jurisdiction of the tribe, absent objection by either parent, upon the petition of either parent or the Indian custodian or the Indian child's tribe. However, the transfer is subject to declination by the tribal court of the tribe. Section 4. In any state court proceeding for the foster care placement of, or termination of parental rights to, an Indian child, the Indian custodian of the child and the Indian child's tribe may intervene at any point in the proceeding. Section 5. The State of South Dakota shall give full faith and credit to the public acts, records, and judicial proceedings of any Indian tribe applicable to Indian child custody proceedings to the same extent that such Indian tribe gives full faith and credit to the public acts, records, and judicial proceedings of the State of South Dakota. Section 6. In any involuntary proceeding in a state court, if the court knows or has reason to know that an Indian child is involved, the party seeking the foster care placement of, or termination of parental rights to, an Indian child shall notify the parent or Indian custodian and the Indian child's tribe, by registered mail with return receipt requested, of the pending proceedings and of their right of intervention. If the identity or location of the parent or Indian custodian and the tribe cannot be determined, such notice shall be given to the secretary in like manner, who has fifteen days after receipt to provide the requisite notice to the parent or Indian custodian and the tribe. No foster care placement or termination of parental rights proceeding may be held until at least ten days after receipt of notice by the parent or Indian custodian and the tribe or the secretary. However, the parent or Indian custodian or the tribe shall, upon request, be granted up to twenty additional days to prepare for the proceeding. The provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 26-7A-15, 26-7A-15.1, 26-7A-15.2, and 26-7A-15.3 also apply in any proceeding under chapters 26-7A, 26-8A, or 26-8B and shall prevail to the extent of any inconsistency with the provisions of this section. Section 7. In any case in which the court determines indigency, the parent or Indian custodian has the right to court-appointed counsel in any removal, placement, or termination proceeding. The court may, in its discretion, appoint counsel for the child upon a finding that the appointment is in the best interest of the child. If state law makes no provision for appointment of counsel in such proceedings, the court shall promptly notify the secretary upon appointment of counsel and request from the secretary, upon certification of the presiding judge, payment of reasonable fees and expenses out of funds that may be appropriated. Section 8. Each party to a foster care placement or termination of parental rights proceeding under state law involving an Indian child may examine all reports or other documents filed with the court upon which any decision with respect to such action may be based. Section 9. Any party seeking to effect a foster care placement of, or termination of parental rights to, an Indian child under state law shall satisfy the court that active efforts have been made to provide remedial services and rehabilitative programs designed to prevent the breakup of the Indian family and that these efforts have proved unsuccessful. No foster care placement may be ordered in such a proceeding in the absence of a determination, supported by clear and convincing evidence, including testimony of qualified expert witnesses, that the continued custody of the child by the parent or Indian custodian is likely to result in serious emotional or physical damage to the child. No termination of parental rights may be ordered in such a proceeding in the absence of a determination, supported by evidence beyond a reasonable doubt, including testimony of qualified expert witnesses, that the continued custody of the child by the parent or Indian custodian is likely to result in serious emotional or physical damage to the child. Section 10. If any parent or Indian custodian voluntarily consents to a foster care placement or to termination of parental rights, such consent is not valid unless executed in writing and recorded before a judge of a court of competent jurisdiction and accompanied by the presiding judge's certificate that the terms and consequences of the consent were fully explained in detail and were fully understood by the parent or Indian custodian. The court shall also certify that either the parent or Indian custodian fully understood the explanation in English or that it was interpreted into a language that the parent or Indian custodian understood. Any consent given before, or within ten days after, birth of the Indian child is not valid. Section 11. Any parent or Indian custodian may withdraw consent to a foster care placement under state law at any time and, upon such withdrawal, the child shall be returned to the parent or Indian custodian. Section 12. In any voluntary proceeding for termination of parental rights to, or adoptive placement of, an Indian child, the consent of the parent may be withdrawn for any reason at any time before the entry of a final decree of termination or adoption, as the case may be, and the child shall be returned to the parent. Section 13. After the entry of a final decree of adoption of an Indian child in any state court, the parent may withdraw consent to the adoption upon the grounds that consent was obtained through fraud or duress and may petition the court to vacate the decree. Upon a finding that the consent was obtained through fraud or duress, the court shall vacate the decree and return the child to the parent. No adoption that has been effective for at least two years may be invalidated under the provisions of this section unless otherwise permitted under state law. Section 14. Any Indian child who is the subject of any action for foster care placement or termination of parental rights under state law, any parent or Indian custodian from whose custody such child was removed, and the Indian child's tribe may petition any court of competent jurisdiction to invalidate such action upon a showing that the action violated any provisions of sections 6 to 14, inclusive, of this Act. Section 15. In any adoptive placement of an Indian child under state law, a preference shall be given, in the absence of good cause to the contrary, to a placement with (1) a member of the child's extended family; (2) other members of the Indian child's tribe; or (3) other Indian families. Section 16. Any child accepted for foster care or preadoptive placement shall be placed in the least restrictive setting which most approximates a family and in which the child's special needs, if any, may be met. The child shall also be placed within reasonable proximity to his or her home, taking into account any special needs of the child. In any foster care or preadoptive placement, a preference shall be given, in the absence of good cause to the contrary, to a placement with: (1) A member of the Indian child's extended family; (2) A foster home licensed, approved, or specified by the Indian child's tribe; (3) An Indian foster home licensed or approved by an authorized non-Indian licensing authority; or (4) An institution for children approved by an Indian tribe or operated by an Indian organization which has a program suitable to meet the Indian child's needs. Section 17. In the case of a placement under section 15 or 16 of this Act, if the Indian child's tribe establishes a different order of preference by resolution, the agency or court effecting the placement shall follow the order if the placement is the least restrictive setting appropriate to the particular needs of the child, as provided in section 16 of this Act. If appropriate, the preference of the Indian child or parent shall be considered. However, if a consenting parent evidences a desire for anonymity, the court or agency shall give weight to such desire in applying the preferences. Section 18. The standards to be applied in meeting the preference requirements of sections 15 to 19, inclusive, of this Act shall be the prevailing social and cultural standards of the Indian community in which the parent or extended family resides or with which the parent or extended family members maintain social and cultural ties. Section 19. A record of each such placement, under state law, of an Indian child shall be maintained by the state in which the placement was made, evidencing the efforts to comply with the order of preference specified in sections 15 to 19, inclusive of this Act. The record shall be made available at any time upon the request of the secretary or the Indian child's tribe. Section 20. Notwithstanding state law to the contrary, if a final decree of adoption of an Indian child has been vacated or set aside or the adoptive parents voluntarily consent to the termination of their parental rights to the child, a biological parent or prior Indian custodian may petition for return of custody and the court shall grant such petition unless there is a showing, in a proceeding subject to the provisions of sections 10 to 13, inclusive, of this Act that such return of custody is not in the best interests of the child. Section 21. If an Indian child is removed from a foster care home or institution for the purpose of further foster care, preadoptive, or adoptive placement, such placement shall be in accordance with the provisions of this Act, except in the case in which an Indian child is being returned to the parent or Indian custodian from whose custody the child was originally removed. Section 22. Upon application by an Indian individual who has reached the age of eighteen and who was the subject of an adoptive placement, the court which entered the final decree shall inform the individual of the tribal affiliation, if any, of the individual's biological parents and provide such other information as may be necessary to protect any rights flowing from the individual's tribal relationship. Section 23. The State of South Dakota may enter into agreements with Indian tribes respecting care and custody of Indian children and jurisdiction over child custody proceedings, including agreements which may provide for orderly transfer of jurisdiction on a case-by-case basis and agreements which provide for concurrent jurisdiction between the state and the Indian tribes. Section 24. Such agreements may be revoked by either party upon one hundred and eighty days' written notice to the other party. The revocation does not affect any action or proceeding over which a court has already assumed jurisdiction, unless the agreement provides otherwise. Section 25. If any petitioner in an Indian child custody proceeding before a state court has improperly removed the child from custody of the parent or Indian custodian or has improperly retained custody after a visit or other temporary relinquishment of custody, the court shall decline jurisdiction over the petition and shall forthwith return the child to the child's parent or Indian custodian unless returning the child to the child's parent or custodian would subject the child to a substantial and immediate danger or threat of such danger. Section 26. In any case where state or federal law applicable to a child custody proceeding provides a higher standard of protection to the rights of the parent or Indian custodian of an Indian child than the rights provided under this chapter, the court shall apply the higher standard. Section 27. Nothing in this Act prevents the emergency removal of an Indian child who is a resident of or is domiciled on a reservation, but temporarily located off the reservation, from the child's parent or Indian custodian or the emergency placement of the child in a foster home or institution, under applicable state law, in order to prevent imminent physical damage or harm to the child. The state authority, official, or agency involved shall insure that the emergency removal or placement terminates immediately when the removal or placement is no longer necessary to prevent imminent physical damage or harm to the child and shall expeditiously initiate a child custody proceeding subject to the provisions of this Act, transfer the child to the jurisdiction of the appropriate Indian tribe, or restore the child to the parent or Indian custodian, as may be appropriate. Section 28. None of the provisions of this Act, except section 6 and section 25 of this Act, affect a proceeding under state law for foster care placement, termination of parental rights, preadoptive placement, or adoptive placement which was initiated or completed prior to one hundred and eighty days after November 8, 1978, but do apply to any subsequent proceeding in the same matter or subsequent proceedings affecting the custody or placement of the same child. Section 29. Any state court entering a final decree or order in any Indian child adoptive placement after July 1, 2009, shall provide the secretary with a copy of the decree or order together with such other information as may be necessary to show: (1) The name and tribal affiliation of the child; (2) The names and addresses of the biological parents; (3) The names and addresses of the adoptive parents; and (4) The identity of any agency having files or information relating to such adoptive placement. If the court records contain an affidavit of the biological parent or parents that their identity remain confidential, the court shall include the affidavit with the other information. Section 30. That \u00a7 25-5A-14 be amended to read as follows: 25-5A-14. The personal presence of one parent at the hearing is required for jurisdictional purposes. However, for good cause shown, and upon notice to any other person or authorized agency whose consent is required pursuant to \u00a7 25-5A-6, the court may permit a parent to appear telephonically if the parent is incarcerated, the parent appears telephonically in the physical presence of a law enforcement or correctional officer designated by the court to monitor the parent's appearance, and the parental rights of the other parent have been terminated or the other parent is deceased. Any other person whose consent is necessary may appear by filing with the court a power of attorney. If the Department of Social Services or a licensed child placement agency has custody of a child by written agreement of a parent with power of attorney to consent, the secretary or an authorized agent may appear and consent. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section, due regard shall be given to the Indian Child Welfare Act (25 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1901 to 1963, inclusive,) as in effect on January 1, 2005 2009 , if applicable , and to sections 1 to 29, inclusive, of this Act if applicable .

If a child custody award has been made in a circuit court in a divorce action or other proceeding and the jurisdiction of the divorce court is continuing, a circuit court may nevertheless acquire jurisdiction in proceedings involving the same child if the child is alleged to be abused, neglected, in need of supervision, delinquent, or otherwise comes within the jurisdiction set forth in this section.
