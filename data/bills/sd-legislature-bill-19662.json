WHEREAS, United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) banned all imports of Canadian beef on May 20, 2003, after a cow from Alberta was discovered to be infected with bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE); and WHEREAS, on December 23, 2003, BSE was discovered in a cow which had been imported from Alberta and discovered in Washington state; and WHEREAS, the discovery of the second BSE infected cow resulted in the ban of at least $1.7 billion of United States beef exports into Japan and numerous other countries despite the fact that the cow was imported from Canada; and WHEREAS, on January 2, 2005, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) confirmed that a third Canadian cow has tested positive for BSE; and WHEREAS, on January 11, 2005, the CFIA detected BSE in another Alberta beef cow, not linked to the January 2nd case, and born after the 1997 feed restrictions; and WHEREAS, no cases of BSE have been found in native United States cattle; and WHEREAS, since 1997, the United States and Canada have prohibited the feeding of protein derived from ruminants (i.e. bone meal and meat meal) to ruminants, such as cattle, with the intention to prevent the establishment and amplification of BSE through feed and thereby minimize any risk to animals and humans; and WHEREAS, a Canadian government study conducted in 2004 found that more than half the feed tested contained animal parts not listed on the ingredients; and WHEREAS, there are concerns that Canada's feed ban is not being properly enforced; and WHEREAS, the importation of Canadian cattle has the potential to jeopardize our ability to re-establish export agreements with Japan, South Korea, and other countries; and WHEREAS, permitting the re-importation of young Canadian live cattle and also beef from older animals will unnecessarily place the United States cattle industry at a competitive disadvantage in global markets: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the House of Representatives of the Eightieth Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the Senate concurring therein, that the Legislature of the State of South Dakota supports the efforts of Governor M. Michael Rounds to keep the Canadian border closed to the importation of Canadian cattle and hereby requests that the USDA initiate the following steps before lifting the import ban on Canadian cattle: (1) Request audits of Canadian feed manufacturers and demand Canadian government officials provide a detailed assessment of feed ban compliance; and (2) Fully define import permit systems and inspect border crossings to verify how cattle will be inspected, identified, have their age determined, and be approved for entry into the United States; and (3) Verify Canadian compliance with BSE firewalls; and (4) Evaluate Canada's BSE testing and surveillance program and review all the findings around the recent BSE cases; and (5) Verify that Canada's surveillance and prevention strategies are sufficient to ensure that they have eliminated BSE in their cow herd; and (6) Request an FDA audit of Canada's compliance with its feed ban; and (7) Continue to ban importation of beef from Canadian cattle older than 30 months of age in any such case the ban is lifted; and (8) Prior to implementing the rule, ensure that Canada and other trading partners with the United States adopt uniform rules regarding minimal risk countries to provide for fair and consistent trade; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that copies of this resolution be forwarded to President George W. Bush, United States Secretary of Agriculture Mike Johanns, Senator John Thune, Senator Tim Johnson, and Representative Stephanie Herseth."}, {"bill_id": 19662, "bill_version_id": 102978, "bill_version": "Enrolled", "bill_version_date": "2005-01-21T09:09:33-06:00", "bill_text": ""}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 19662, "action_date": "2005-01-14T13:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 102789, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/102789.pdf", "status_text": "Introduced", "journal_page": 57, "committee_id_action": 860, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 19662, "action_date": "2005-01-18T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 102850, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/102850.pdf", "status_text": "Adopt Resolution", "journal_page": 82, "committee_id_action": 860, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 61791, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [3155, 3156, 3158, 3159, 3160, 3161, 3162, 3164, 3167, 3169, 3170, 3171, 3172, 3174, 3175, 3176, 3177, 3178, 3181, 3182, 3183, 3184, 3187, 3188, 3189, 3190, 3191, 3192, 3195, 3196, 3197, 3203, 3206, 3207, 3208, 3209, 3211, 3213, 3216, 3218, 3220, 3222, 3223, 3225, 3226, 3231, 3232, 3233, 3234, 3235, 3237, 3238, 3240, 3243, 3245, 3246, 3248, 3252, 3253, 3254, 3255, 3215], "Excused": [3194, 3199, 3227, 3229, 3230, 3244, 3249, 3251]}}, {"bill_id": 19662, "action_date": "2005-01-19T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 102894, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/102894.pdf", "status_text": "Introduced", "journal_page": 111, "committee_id_action": 861, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 19662, "action_date": "2005-01-20T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 102964, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/102964.pdf", "status_text": "Concur In resolution", "journal_page": 124, "committee_id_action": 861, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 60914, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [3150, 3151, 3152, 3153, 3154, 3157, 3163, 3165, 3166, 3168, 3173, 3179, 3180, 3185, 3186, 3193, 3198, 3201, 3202, 3204, 3205, 3210, 3212, 3214, 3217, 3219, 3221, 3224, 3228, 3236, 3239, 3241, 3247], "Excused": [3200, 3242]}}]}
