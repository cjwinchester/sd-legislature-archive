BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. Any purchase of more than eighty acres of land, for whatever purpose, by whatever funding source, shall only be contracted for by the State of South Dakota subject to subsequent legislative approval by specific statutory enactment. Within sixteen months from the date of any contract to purchase eighty or more acres of land, the head of the purchasing agency shall have legislation introduced in the Legislature providing for specific legislative approval of the purchase. Failure of the Legislature to enact specific statutory approval for any such purchase within twenty-one months of the date of the contract renders the contract void. Section 2. The provisions of this Act do not apply to the Department of Transportation. Section 3. The provisions of this Act do not apply to any purchase of more than eighty acres of land if purchase price is less than one third of the appraised value as determined by an independent appraiser selected and appointed by the Commissioner of School and Public Lands and paid by the purchasing agency. 135 copies were printed on recycled paper by the South Dakota Legislative Research Council at a cost of $.075 per page. .
