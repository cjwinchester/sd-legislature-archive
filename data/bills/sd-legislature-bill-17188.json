The longevity compensation for years of employment seven to ten, inclusive, is one hundred dollars. The longevity compensation for years of employment eleven to fourteen, inclusive, is equal to ten dollars per year of employment until the fifteenth year of service at which time the longevity pay shall be equal to fifteen dollars per year of service. Longevity pay shall increase at five dollar increments thereafter for each additional five years of employment.

It is payable annually in one lump sum. The commissioner of the Bureau of Personnel shall promulgate rules , pursuant to chapter 1-26 , to determine the state employee position categories that are eligible for longevity pay, the criteria for payment for prior years of service, the date for payment, and the type of service that may be used to calculate longevity.
