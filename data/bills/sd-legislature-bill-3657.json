Beginning with fiscal year 2006, the market value of the trust fund shall be determined by adding the market value of the trust fund at the end of the sixteen most recent calendar quarters, and dividing that sum by sixteen transfer from the trust fund to the state general fund four percent of the lesser of the average market value of the trust fund determined by adding the market value of the trust fund at the end of the sixteen most recent calendar quarters as of December thirty-first of that year and dividing that sum by sixteen, or the market value of the trust fund at the end of that calendar year for the support of education in South Dakota.
