Section 4. Section 1-104. This title being a general act intended as a unified coverage of its subject matter, no part of it may be deemed to be impliedly repealed by subsequent legislation if such construction can reasonably be avoided. Section 5. Section 1-105. If any provision or clause of this title or its application to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not affect other provisions or applications of this title which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to this end the provisions of this title are severable. Section 6. Section 1-106. In this title, unless the statutory context otherwise requires: (1) Words in the singular number include the plural, and those in the plural include the singular; and (2) Words of any gender also refer to any other gender.

A buyer in ordinary course of business may buy for cash, by exchange of other property, or on secured or unsecured credit, and may acquire goods or documents of title under a preexisting contract for sale. Only a buyer that takes possession of the goods or has a right to recover the goods from the seller under Article 2 may be a buyer in ordinary course of business. \"Buyer in ordinary course of business\" does not include a person that acquires goods in a transfer in bulk or as security for or in total or partial satisfaction of a money debt.

Except as otherwise provided in Section 2-505, the right of a seller or lessor of goods under Article 2 or 2A to retain or acquire possession of the goods is not a \"security interest,\" but a seller or lessor may also acquire a \"security interest\" by complying with Article 9. The retention or reservation of title by a seller of goods notwithstanding shipment or delivery to the buyer under Section 2-401 is limited in effect to a reservation of a \"security interest.\" Whether a transaction in the form of a lease creates a \"security interest\" is determined pursuant to Section 1-203. (36) \"Send\" in connection with a writing, record, or notice means: (A) To deposit in the mail or deliver for transmission by any other usual means of communication with postage or cost of transmission provided for and properly addressed and, in the case of an instrument, to an address specified thereon or otherwise agreed, or if there be none to any address reasonable under the circumstances; or (B) In any other way to cause to be received any record or notice within the time it would have arrived if properly sent.

(a) Subject to subsection (f), a person has \"notice\" of a fact if the person: (1) Has actual knowledge of it; (2) Has received a notice or notification of it; or (3) From all the facts and circumstances known to the person at the time in question, has reason to know that it exists. (b) \"Knowledge\" means actual knowledge. \"Knows\" has a corresponding meaning. (c) \"Discover,\" \"learn,\" or words of similar import refer to knowledge rather than to reason to know. (d) A person \"notifies\" or \"gives\" a notice or notification to another person by taking such steps as may be reasonably required to inform the other person in ordinary course, whether or not the other person actually comes to know of it. (e) Subject to subsection (f), a person \"receives\" a notice or notification when: (1) It comes to that person's attention; or (2) It is duly delivered in a form reasonable under the circumstances at the place of business through which the contract was made or at another location held out by that person as the place for receipt of such communications. (f) Notice, knowledge, or a notice or notification received by an organization is effective for a particular transaction from the time it is brought to the attention of the individual conducting that transaction and, in any event, from the time it would have been brought to the individual's attention if the organization had exercised due diligence. An organization exercises due diligence if it maintains reasonable routines for communicating significant information to the person conducting the transaction and there is reasonable compliance with the routines. Due diligence does not require an individual acting for the organization to communicate information unless the communication is part of the individual's regular duties or the individual has reason to know of the transaction and that the transaction would be materially affected by the information. Section 11. Section 1-203. (a) Whether a transaction in the form of a lease creates a lease or security interest is determined by the facts of each case. (b) A transaction in the form of a lease creates a security interest if the consideration that the lessee is to pay the lessor for the right to possession and use of the goods is an obligation for the term of the lease and is not subject to termination by the lessee, and: (1) The original term of the lease is equal to or greater than the remaining economic life of the goods; (2) The lessee is bound to renew the lease for the remaining economic life of the goods or is bound to become the owner of the goods; (3) The lessee has an option to renew the lease for the remaining economic life of the goods for no additional consideration or for nominal additional consideration upon compliance with the lease agreement; or (4) The lessee has an option to become the owner of the goods for no additional consideration or for nominal additional consideration upon compliance with the lease agreement. (c) A transaction in the form of a lease does not create a security interest merely because: (1) The present value of the consideration the lessee is obligated to pay the lessor for the right to possession and use of the goods is substantially equal to or is greater than the fair market value of the goods at the time the lease is entered into; (2) The lessee assumes risk of loss of the goods; (3) The lessee agrees to pay, with respect to the goods, taxes, insurance, filing, recording, or registration fees, or service or maintenance costs; (4) The lessee has an option to renew the lease or to become the owner of the goods; (5) The lessee has an option to renew the lease for a fixed rent that is equal to or greater than the reasonably predictable fair market rent for the use of the goods for the term of the renewal at the time the option is to be performed; or (6) The lessee has an option to become the owner of the goods for a fixed price that is equal to or greater than the reasonably predictable fair market value of the goods at the time the option is to be performed. (d) Additional consideration is nominal if it is less than the lessee's reasonably predictable cost of performing under the lease agreement if the option is not exercised. Additional consideration is not nominal if: (1) When the option to renew the lease is granted to the lessee, the rent is stated to be the fair market rent for the use of the goods for the term of the renewal determined at the time the option is to be performed; or (2) When the option to become the owner of the goods is granted to the lessee, the price is stated to be the fair market value of the goods determined at the time the option is to be performed. (e) The \"remaining economic life of the goods\" and \"reasonably predictable\" fair market rent, fair market value, or cost of performing under the lease agreement must be determined with reference to the facts and circumstances at the time the transaction is entered into. Section 12. Section 1-204. Except as otherwise provided in Articles 3, 4, and 5, a person gives value for rights if the person acquires them: (1) In return for a binding commitment to extend credit or for the extension of immediately available credit, whether or not drawn upon and whether or not a charge-back is provided for in the event of difficulties in collection; (2) As security for, or in total or partial satisfaction of, a preexisting claim; (3) By accepting delivery under a preexisting contract for purchase; or (4) In return for any consideration sufficient to support a simple contract. Section 13. Section 1-205. (a) Whether a time for taking an action required by this title is reasonable depends on the nature, purpose, and circumstances of the action. (b) An action is taken seasonably if it is taken at or within the time agreed or, if no time is agreed, at or within a reasonable time. Section 14. Section 1-206. Whenever this title creates a \"presumption\" with respect to a fact, or provides that a fact is \"presumed,\" the trier of fact must find the existence of the fact unless and until evidence is introduced that supports a finding of its nonexistence. Section 15. Section 1-301. (1) Except as provided hereafter in this section, when a transaction bears a reasonable relation to this state and also to another state or nation the parties may agree that the law either of this state or of such other state or nation shall govern their rights and duties. Failing such agreement this title applies to transactions bearing an appropriate relation to this state. (2) Where one of the following provisions of this title specifies the applicable law, that provision governs and a contrary agreement is effective only to the extent permitted by the law (including the conflict of laws rules) so specified: Rights of creditors against sold goods. \u00a7 57A-2-402. Applicability of the article on leases. \u00a7\u00a7 57A-2A-105 and 57A-2A-106. Applicability of the chapters on bank deposits and collections. \u00a7 57A-4-102. Governing law in the article on funds transfers. \u00a7 57A-4A-507. Letters of Credit. \u00a7 57A-5-116. Applicability of the chapters on investment securities. \u00a7 57A-8-110. Law governing perfection, the effect of perfection or nonperfection, and the priority of security interests and agricultural liens. \u00a7\u00a7 57-9-301 to 57-9-307, inclusive. Section 16. Section 1-302. (a) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b) or elsewhere in this title, the effect of provisions of this title may be varied by agreement. (b) The obligations of good faith, diligence, reasonableness, and care prescribed by this title may not be disclaimed by agreement. The parties, by agreement, may determine the standards by which the performance of those obligations is to be measured if those standards are not manifestly unreasonable. Whenever this title requires an action to be taken within a reasonable time, a time that is not manifestly unreasonable may be fixed by agreement. (c) The presence in certain provisions of this title of the phrase \"unless otherwise agreed,\" or words of similar import, does not imply that the effect of other provisions may not be varied by agreement under this section. Section 17. Section 1-303. (a) A \"course of performance\" is a sequence of conduct between the parties to a particular transaction that exists if: (1) The agreement of the parties with respect to the transaction involves repeated occasions for performance by a party; and (2) The other party, with knowledge of the nature of the performance and opportunity for objection to it, accepts the performance or acquiesces in it without objection. (b) A \"course of dealing\" is a sequence of conduct concerning previous transactions between the parties to a particular transaction that is fairly to be regarded as establishing a common basis of understanding for interpreting their expressions and other conduct. (c) A \"usage of trade\" is any practice or method of dealing having such regularity of observance in a place, vocation, or trade as to justify an expectation that it will be observed with respect to the transaction in question. The existence and scope of such a usage must be proved as facts. If it is established that such a usage is embodied in a trade code or similar record, the interpretation of the record is a question of law. (d) A course of performance or course of dealing between the parties or usage of trade in the vocation or trade in which they are engaged or of which they are or should be aware is relevant in ascertaining the meaning of the parties' agreement, may give particular meaning to specific terms of the agreement, and may supplement or qualify the terms of the agreement. A usage of trade applicable in the place in which part of the performance under the agreement is to occur may be so utilized as to that part of the performance. (e) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (f), the express terms of an agreement and any applicable course of performance, course of dealing, or usage of trade must be construed whenever reasonable as consistent with each other. If such a construction is unreasonable: (1) Express terms prevail over course of performance, course of dealing, and usage of trade; (2) Course of performance prevails over course of dealing and usage of trade; and (3) Course of dealing prevails over usage of trade. (f) Subject to Section 2-209, a course of performance is relevant to show a waiver or modification of any term inconsistent with the course of performance. (g) Evidence of a relevant usage of trade offered by one party is not admissible unless that party has given the other party notice that the court finds sufficient to prevent unfair surprise to the other party. Section 18. Section 1-304. Every contract or duty within this title imposes an obligation of good faith in its performance and enforcement. Section 19. Section 1-305. (a) The remedies provided by this title must be liberally administered to the end that the aggrieved party may be put in as good a position as if the other party had fully performed but neither consequential or special damages nor penal damages may be had except as specifically provided in this title or by other rule of law. (b) Any right or obligation declared by this title is enforceable by action unless the provision declaring it specifies a different and limited effect. Section 20. Section 1-306. A claim or right arising out of an alleged breach may be discharged in whole or in part without consideration by agreement of the aggrieved party in an authenticated record. Section 21. Section 1-307. A document in due form purporting to be a bill of lading, policy or certificate of insurance, official weigher's or inspector's certificate, consular invoice, or any other document authorized or required by the contract to be issued by a third party is prima facie evidence of its own authenticity and genuineness and of the facts stated in the document by the third party. Section 22. Section 1-308. (a) A party that with explicit reservation of rights performs or promises performance or assents to performance in a manner demanded or offered by the other party does not thereby prejudice the rights reserved. Such words as \"without prejudice,\" \"under protest,\" or the like are sufficient. (b) Subsection (a) does not apply to an accord and satisfaction. Section 23. Section 1-309. A term providing that one party or that party's successor in interest may accelerate payment or performance or require collateral or additional collateral \"at will\" or when the party \"deems itself insecure,\" or words of similar import, means that the party has power to do so only if that party in good faith believes that the prospect of payment or performance is impaired. The burden of establishing lack of good faith is on the party against which the power has been exercised. Section 24. Section 1-310. An obligation may be issued as subordinated to performance of another obligation of the person obligated, or a creditor may subordinate its right to performance of an obligation by agreement with either the person obligated or another creditor of the person obligated. Subordination does not create a security interest as against either the common debtor or a subordinated creditor. Section 25. That \u00a7 57A-2-103 be amended to read as follows: 57A-2-103. (1) In this chapter unless the context otherwise requires: (a) \"Buyer\" means a person who buys or contracts to buy goods.

Section 31. That \u00a7 57A-2A-518 be amended to read as follows: 57A-2A-518.

(2) Except as otherwise provided with respect to damages liquidated in the lease agreement (\u00a7 57A-2A-504) or otherwise determined by agreement of the parties (\u00a7\u00a7 57A-1-302 and 57A-2A-503 and 57A-1-102(3) ), if a lessee's cover is by lease agreement substantially similar to the original lease agreement and the lease agreement is made in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner, the lessee may recover from the lessor as damages (a) the present value, as of the date of the commencement of the new lease agreement, of the difference between the total rent for the lease term of the new lease agreement and the total rent for the then remaining lease term of the original lease agreement and (b) any incidental or consequential damages less expenses saved in consequence of the lessor's default. (3) If the lessee's cover is by lease agreement that qualifies for treatment under subsection (2) of this section, the lessee may elect to proceed under subsection (2) of this section or \u00a7 57A-2A-519. If a lessee's cover is by lease agreement that for any reason does not qualify for treatment under subsection (2) of this section, or is by purchase or otherwise, the lessee may recover from the lessor under \u00a7 57A-2A-519 as if the lessee had elected not to cover.

(2) Market rent is to be determined as of the place for tender or, in cases of rejection after arrival or revocation of acceptance, as of the place of arrival. (3) If the lessee has accepted goods and given notification (\u00a7 57A-2A-516(3)), the measure of damages for nonconforming tender or delivery by a lessor is the loss resulting in the ordinary course of events from the lessor's default as determined in any manner that is reasonable together with incidental and consequential damages, less expenses saved in consequence of the lessor's default. (4) The measure of damages for breach of warranty is the present value at the time and place of acceptance of the difference between the value of the use of the goods accepted and the value if they had been as warranted for the lease term, unless special circumstances show proximate damages of a different amount, together with incidental and consequential damages, less expenses saved in consequence of the lessor's default or breach of warranty. Section 33. That \u00a7 57A-2A-527 be amended to read as follows: 57A-2A-527.

(3) If the lessor's disposition is by lease agreement that qualifies for treatment under subsection (2) of this section, the lessor may elect to proceed under subsection (2) or \u00a7 57A-2A-528. If the lessor's disposition is by lease agreement that for any reason does not qualify for treatment under subsection (2) of this section, or is by sale or otherwise, the lessor may recover from the lessee under \u00a7 57A-2A-528 as if the lessor had elected not to dispose of the goods. (4) A subsequent buyer or lessee who buys or leases from the lessor in good faith for value as a result of a disposition under this section takes the goods free of the original lease contract and any rights of the original lessee even though the lessor fails to comply with one or more of the requirements of this chapter. (5) The lessor is not accountable to the lessee for any profit made on any disposition. A lessee who has rightfully rejected or justifiably revoked acceptance shall account to the lessor for any excess over the amount of the lessee's security interest (\u00a7 57A-2A- 508(5)). Section 34. That \u00a7 57A-2A-528 be amended to read as follows: 57A-2A-528. (1) Except as otherwise provided with respect to damages liquidated in the lease agreement (\u00a7 57A-2A-504) or determined by agreement of the parties (\u00a7\u00a7 57A-1-302 and 57A-2A-503 and 57A-1-102(3) ), if a lessor elects to retain the goods or a lessor elects to dispose of the goods and disposition is by lease agreement, whether or not the lease agreement qualifies for treatment under \u00a7 57A-2A-527(2), or is by sale or otherwise, the lessor may recover from the lessee as damages for default by the lessee (\u00a7 57A-2A-523(1)) (a) accrued and unpaid rent as of the date the lessor obtained possession of the goods or such earlier date as the lessee has made an effective tender of possession of the goods back to the lessor, (b) the present value as of the date determined under paragraph (a) of the difference between the total rent for the then remaining lease term of the original lease agreement and the market rent at the time determined under paragraph (a) and at the place where the goods were located on that date computed for the same lease term, and (c) any incidental damages allowed under \u00a7 57A-2A-530, less expenses saved in consequence of the lessee's default. (2) If the measure of damages provided in subsection (1) of this section is inadequate to put a lessor in as good a position as performance would have, the measure of damages is the present value of the profit, including reasonable overhead, the lessor would have made from full performance by the lessee, together with any incidental damages allowed under \u00a7 57A-2A-530, due allowance for costs reasonably incurred and due credit for payments or proceeds of disposition.

In the case of a bank that takes an instrument for processing for collection or payment by automated means, reasonable commercial standards do not require the bank to examine the instrument if the failure to examine does not violate the bank's prescribed procedures and the bank's procedures do not vary unreasonably from general banking usage not disapproved by this chapter or chapter 57A-4. (8) \"Party\" means a party to an instrument. (9) \"Promise\" means a written undertaking to pay money signed by the person undertaking to pay.

A receiving bank may fix a cut-off time or times on a funds-transfer business day for the receipt and processing of payment orders and communications cancelling or amending payment orders. Different cut-off times may apply to payment orders, cancellations or amendments, or to different categories of payment orders, cancellations or amendments.

However, the customer is not entitled to interest from the bank on the amount to be refunded if the customer fails to exercise ordinary care to determine that the order was not authorized by the customer and to notify the bank of the relevant facts within a reasonable time not exceeding ninety days after the date the customer received notification from the bank that the order was accepted or that the customer's account was debited with respect to the order. The bank is not entitled to any recovery from the customer on account of a failure by the customer to give notification as stated in this section.

A term in an agreement or undertaking generally excusing liability or generally limiting remedies for failure to perform obligations is not sufficient to vary obligations prescribed by this chapter.
