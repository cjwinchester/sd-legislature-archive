The bonds shall be payable solely from the collections of the tax imposed by the county under this Act, as determined by the board of county commissioners. The board of county commissioners shall, in the resolution or ordinance authorizing the bonds, agree that the county will continue to impose and collect the taxes so long as the bonds are outstanding. The board of county commissioners shall also pledge so much of the collections of the taxes as may be necessary to pay the principal premium and interest on the bonds and to maintain any debt service reserve established for the bonds.
