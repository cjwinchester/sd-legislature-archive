Any property owner may grant a wind easement in the same manner and with the same effect as a conveyance of an interest in real property. The easement shall be created in writing, and the easement or a memorandum of the easement shall be filed, duly recorded, and indexed in the office of the register of deeds of the county in which the easement is granted.

Any such easement is void if no development of the potential to produce energy from wind power associated with the easement has occurred within five years after the easement began. Any payments associated with the granting or continuance of any such easement shall be made on an annual basis to the owner of record of the real property at the time the payment is made. If the easement holder mortgages or otherwise encumbers to any party any part of the easement holder's rights and interests under the easement, any such mortgage or encumbrance on the easement is the responsibility of the easement holder and attaches only to the easement holder's rights and does not otherwise attach to the land or obligate the property owner.

However, such rights may be leased for a period not to exceed fifty years in accordance with a lease agreement agreed to by the property owner and the lessee.
