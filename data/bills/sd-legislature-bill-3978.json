BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 34-26-21.1 be amended to read as follows: 34-26-21.1. The Department of Public Safety, with the advice of the Department of Health, shall provide each person renewing or applying for a driver license or nondriver identification card an opportunity to review information about organ donation, such as information available from the organ procurement organization designated by the federal government for this state. The person shall affirm on the application that the person has reviewed the information. The department shall distribute this information: (1) On the Department of Public Safety website; (2) Through information mailed with each driver license and identification card renewal notice; (3) On posters and brochures made available at each driver license exam station; (4) Through each driver license manual published after July 1, 2013; and (5) Through any other means the Department of Public Safety deems appropriate. Section 2. That \u00a7 34-26-52 be amended to read as follows: 34-26-52. (a) A donor may make an anatomical gift: (1) By checking a box on the driver license or identification card application authorizing a statement or symbol indicating that the donor has made an anatomical gift to be imprinted on the donor's driver's driver license or identification card. The issuance of a driver license or identification card with a donor designation completes the donation process and is effective unless the donor requests removal of the donor designation; (2) In a will; (3) During a terminal illness or injury of the donor, by any form of communication addressed to at least two adults, at least one of whom is a disinterested witness; or (4) As provided in subsection paragraph (b). (b) A donor or other person authorized to make an anatomical gift under \u00a7 34-26-51 may make a gift by a donor card or other record signed by the donor or other person making the gift or by authorizing that a statement or symbol indicating that the donor has made an anatomical gift be included on a donor registry.

(c) Revocation, suspension, expiration, or cancellation of a driver's driver license or identification card upon which an anatomical gift is indicated does not invalidate the gift. (d) An anatomical gift made by will takes effect upon the donor's death whether or not the will is probated. Invalidation of the will after the donor' death does not invalidate the gift. Section 3. That chapter 34-26 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: The department shall maintain a computer record of donors and shall place the designation on each driver license or identification card subsequently issued to the donor. The department is not required to maintain the physical record of the donor card or application after issuing the driver license or identification card for the donation to be valid. Upon receipt of a written notice to remove the donor designation the department shall remove the designation from all department computer records and shall issue a new driver license or identification card without the designation to the requestor.

(c) A donor registry must: (1) Allow a donor or other person authorized under \u00a7 34-26-51 to include on the donor registry a statement or symbol that the donor has made, amended, or revoked an anatomical gift; (2) Allow a donor or other person online access to register as a donor, to amend an existing donor status, or remove an existing donor registration seven days a week on a twenty-four hour basis; (3) Be accessible electronically to a procurement organization organ, tissue, and eye procurement organization operating in South Dakota to allow it the procurement organization to obtain relevant information on the donor registry to determine, at or near death of the donor or a prospective donor, whether the donor or prospective donor has made, amended, or revoked an anatomical gift; and (3)(4) Be accessible for purposes of paragraph subdivision (2) seven days a week on a twenty-four hour basis. (d) Personally identifiable information on a donor registry about a donor or prospective donor may not be used or disclosed without the express consent of the donor, prospective donor, or person that made the anatomical gift for any purpose other than to determine, at or near death of the donor or prospective donor, whether the donor or prospective donor has made, amended, or revoked an anatomical gift.
