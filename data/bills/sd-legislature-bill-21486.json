BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That chapter 2-9 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: The Legislature finds that language used in reference to persons with disabilities shapes and reflects society's attitudes towards people with disabilities and that many of the terms currently used by society diminish the humanity and natural condition of having a disability. Certain of these terms are demeaning and create an invisible barrier to inclusion as equal community members. Terminology that references persons with disabilities should not imply that such persons are disabled as a whole, equate persons with their condition, or have negative overtones of a derogatory or demeaning effect. The Legislature finds that it is therefore appropriate to clarify that for new and revised laws and rules use should be made of terminology that puts the person before the disability. Section 2. That chapter 2-9 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: The Legislative Research Council is directed to avoid all references to the terms, disabled, developmentally disabled, mentally disabled, mentally ill, mentally retarded, handicapped, cripple, and crippled, in any new statute or resolution, and to change those references in any existing statute or resolution as sections including those references are otherwise amended by law. The Legislative Research Council is directed to replace the terms referenced above as may be appropriate with terminology such as persons with disabilities, persons with cognitive disabilities, persons with mental disabilities, persons with sensory disabilities, and persons with physical disabilities. No statute or resolution is invalid because it does not comply with this section. Section 3. All state agency rules, or amendments to existing rules, shall be formulated in accordance with the directive of section 2 of this Act regarding the use of appropriate language. No agency rule is invalid because it does not comply with this Act."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 21486, "action_date": "2007-02-01T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 111410, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/111410.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 308, "committee_id_action": 923, "committee_id_assigned": 918, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 21486, "action_date": "2007-02-07T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 111739, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/111739.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 918, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 21486, "action_date": "2007-02-07T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 111739, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/111739.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to 41st legislative day", "journal_page": 390, "committee_id_action": 918, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 64772, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [3578, 3582, 3584, 3593, 3629, 3656, 3668, 3657], "Excused": [3590], "Nay": [3598, 3609, 3637, 3638]}}]}
