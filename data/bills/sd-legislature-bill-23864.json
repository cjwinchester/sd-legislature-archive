That \u00a7 58-17I-5 be REPEALED: Each health carrier shall submit to the director, at least annually, a report in the format specified by the director. The report shall include for each type of health benefit plan offered by the health carrier: (1) The certificate of compliance required by \u00a7 58-17I-6; (2) The number of covered lives; (3) The total number of grievances; (4) The number of grievances resolved at each level, if applicable, and their resolution; (5) The number of grievances appealed to the director of which the health carrier has been informed; (6) The number of grievances referred to alternative dispute resolution procedures or resulting in litigation; and (7) A synopsis of actions being taken to correct problems identified. (SL 2012, ch 239, \u00a7 1 provides: \"The provisions of chapter 219 of the 2011 Session Laws shall be deemed repealed if the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Pub. L.

A covered person may file a request for external review in accordance with rules promulgated by the director. In addition a covered person is entitled to pursue any available remedies under state or federal law on the basis that the health carrier failed to provide a reasonable internal claims and appeals process that would yield a decision on the merits of the claim. A health carrier shall file with the director a copy of the procedures required under this section, including all forms used to process requests made pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 58-17I-7 to 58-17I-11, inclusive.

A description of the grievance procedures required under this section shall be set forth in or attached to the policy, certificate, membership booklet, outline of coverage, or other evidence of coverage provided to covered persons.
