Terms used in this chapter mean: (1) \"Commission,\" the Public Utilities Commission; (2) \"Grain,\" grain, grain sorghums, beans, and oil seeds. However, the term does not include grain that has been cleaned, processed, and specifically identified for an intended use of planting for reproduction or grain purchased to feed livestock; (3) \"Grain buyer,\" any person who purchases grain for the purpose of reselling the unprocessed grain or who purchases three hundred thousand dollars worth or more of grain directly from producers in a calendar year. However, nothing in this chapter applies to the isolated or occasional resale of grain by a person producer who does not hold himself or herself out as engaging in the business of reselling grain; (4) \"Person,\" any natural person, firm, corporation, company, limited liability company, partnership, association, joint stock company or the lessee, trustee, or receiver appointed by any court for any one of the foregoing; (5) \"Voluntary credit sale,\" a sale of grain or seeds pursuant to which the sale price is to be paid more than thirty days after the delivery or release of the grain for sale, including those contracts commonly referred to as deferred-payment contracts, deferred-pricing contracts and price-later contracts ; and (6) \"Producer,\" a person engaged in the business of grain production . Section 2. That \u00a7 49-45-9 be amended to read as follows: 49-45-9. Before any grain buyer license is issued by the commission, the applicant shall file with the commission a bond conditioned to secure the faithful performance of the applicant's obligations as a grain buyer and full and unreserved compliance with the laws of this state and the rules of the commission, relating to the purchase of grain by the grain buyer. The bond is for the specific purpose of protecting persons selling grain to the grain buyer. However, the bond may not benefit any person entering into a voluntary credit sale with a grain buyer. Any person who does business as a grain buyer without a bond is guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor. Each day a person conducts the business of a grain buyer without a bond is a separate offense. The amount of the bond for a Class A or Class B grain buyer's license shall be based on a rolling average of the dollar amount of grain purchased by the applicant in South Dakota during the last three calendar years. For a new grain buyer, the first year's bond shall be based on projected purchases. For a grain buyer with less than three years experience as a grain buyer, the bond shall be based on the average actual purchases made by the grain buyer in all of its previous years as a grain buyer. The bond applies to all grain purchases for all of the grain buyer's business locations. The amount of the bond for a Class A grain buyer's license is: Bond requirements are increased twenty-five thousand dollars for each additional ten million dollars in purchases above one hundred million dollars. The amount of the bond for a Class B grain buyer's license is: The grain buyer may stipulate to a higher bond amount requested by the commission or may post additional security in another form .
