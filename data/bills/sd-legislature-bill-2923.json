WHEREAS, Systemic Lupus Erythematosus, commonly known as lupus, is an acute, chronic, complex, and often life-threatening autoimmune disease; and WHEREAS, lupus can affect virtually every organ system in the body, including the skin, lungs, heart, kidneys, and brain. The disease can cause seizures, strokes, heart attacks, miscarriages, and organ failure; and WHEREAS, the Lupus Foundation of America estimates that more than 1.5 million Americans live with some form of lupus, including nearly four thousand people in South Dakota; and WHEREAS, while lupus strikes mostly women of childbearing age, no one is safe from the disease. Women of color develop lupus at a rate of two to three times the rate of Caucasians - a disparity that remains unexplained; and WHEREAS, lupus can be particularly difficult to diagnose because its symptoms are similar to those of many other illnesses and major gaps exist in understanding the causes and consequences of lupus; and WHEREAS, more than half of all people with lupus take four or more years and visit three or more doctors before obtaining a correct diagnosis; and WHEREAS, early diagnosis and proper treatments are critical to the improvement of the quality of life and survival rate of those living with lupus; and WHEREAS, lupus impacts more than just the life of the patient; it affects their family, friends, coworkers, employers, and the community; and WHEREAS, increased public awareness, education, and research are key to winning the battle against lupus: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the House of Representatives of the Eighty-sixth Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the Senate concurring therein, that the South Dakota Legislature strongly urges all citizens of South Dakota to educate themselves on the symptoms and impact of lupus and join with lupus advocacy groups such as the Lupus Foundation of American in supporting programs of research, education, and community service."}, {"bill_id": 2923, "bill_version_id": 16945, "bill_version": "Enrolled", "bill_version_date": "2011-02-16T09:26:56.217-06:00", "bill_text": ""}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 2923, "action_date": "2011-02-09T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 16628, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/16628.pdf", "status_text": "First Reading", "journal_page": 336, "committee_id_action": 115, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 2923, "action_date": "2011-02-10T13:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 16727, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/16727.pdf", "status_text": "Adopt Resolution", "journal_page": 356, "committee_id_action": 115, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 8921, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [12, 53, 56, 17, 33, 21, 72, 60, 87, 1, 105, 51, 49, 59, 36, 7, 94, 104, 84, 88, 61, 90, 57, 11, 63, 96, 23, 62, 39, 54, 20, 71, 92, 28, 37, 83, 95, 58, 85, 103, 3, 32, 102, 68, 98, 67, 99, 64, 73, 69, 50, 14, 6, 86, 93, 74, 35, 97, 101, 66, 100, 91, 89, 65, 47, 5], "Excused": [48, 15, 70, 29]}}, {"bill_id": 2923, "action_date": "2011-02-14T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 16827, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/16827.pdf", "status_text": "First Reading", "journal_page": 412, "committee_id_action": 113, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 2923, "action_date": "2011-02-15T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 16915, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/16915.pdf", "status_text": "Concurred in Resolution", "journal_page": 430, "committee_id_action": 113, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 9054, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [44, 75, 30, 42, 79, 40, 46, 41, 24, 26, 25, 38, 78, 76, 2, 18, 77, 82, 55, 31, 43, 4, 16, 9, 10, 19, 81, 27, 34, 52, 80, 8, 45, 22], "Excused": [13]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/2923"}
