BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 31-5-21 be amended to read as follows: 31-5-21. The Transportation Commission may , by rule adopted rules promulgated pursuant to chapter 1-26, authorize the issuance of permits for the mowing of ditches on the state trunk highway and interstate highway systems, to fix fees for issuance of such the permits, to establish when mowing may be done, by whom mowing may be done, how and where mowing may be done and the time limit for removal of hay if mowing is done for hay production. However, such the rules and regulations shall provide that the original owner or assigns of land abutting the ditches on the state trunk highway and interstate highway systems shall be given priority in the issuance of such the permits. In addition, no rules may be promulgated which would prohibit the mowing of a right-of-way west of the Missouri River before a specific date each year. 350 copies of this document were printed by the South Dakota Legislative Research Council at a cost of $.027 per page. .
