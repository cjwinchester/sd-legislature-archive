Section 5. Any school district that receives a grant pursuant to this Act, shall, within one year of receiving the grant, provide a written report to the Department of Education that includes the following: (1) A summary of the progress made through the use of the grant with respect to the performance measures used and the school district's objectives; (2) A summary of the impact the funds have had on participating students with particular emphasis on student assessments; and (3) An identification of any barriers to success the district has encountered or any solutions that have been identified by the district to the problems they sought to address through use of the grant. Section 6. The department shall promulgate rules pursuant to chapter 1-26 to establish procedures and timelines for the application process, the selection process, and the distribution of grant funds. Section 7. There is hereby appropriated from the general fund, after the transfer of earnings from the education enhancement trust fund created in Article XII, section 6 of the South Dakota Constitution, pursuant to \u00a7 4-5-29.2, the sum of two million dollars ($2,000,000), or so much thereof that may be necessary, to the Department of Education for allocation to school districts to provide funding for the grants awarded pursuant to this Act. Section 8. Any amounts appropriated in this Act not lawfully expended or obligated by June 30, 2006, shall revert in accordance with \u00a7 4-8-21. Section 9. The department shall provide a Student Achievement Enhancement Grant to any school district that meets the qualifications set forth in section 3 of this Act.
