At that time, the other revenue base amount is calculated as defined above. For a school district created or reorganized after July 1, 2016, the other revenue base amount is the sum of the other revenue base amount for each district before reorganization, and the new school district may not utilize the alternative local need calculation. In the case of the dissolution and annexation of a district, the other revenue base amount of the dissolved school district will be prorated based on the total number of students in the fall enrollment as defined in subdivision (2) who attend each district to which area of the dissolved district were annexed to in the first year of reorganization.

The amount apportioned for each district will be added to the annexed districts' other revenue base; (15) \"Wind energy tax revenue,\" any wind energy tax revenue apportioned to school districts pursuant to \u00a7 10-35-21 from a wind farm producing power for the first time before July 1, 2016, shall be considered local effort pursuant to subdivision (13) and other revenue base amount pursuant to subdivision (14). However, any wind energy tax revenue apportioned to a school district from a wind farm producing power for the first time after June 30, 2016, one hundred percent shall be retained by the school district to which the tax revenue is apportioned for the first five years of producing power, eighty percent for the sixth year, sixty percent for the seventh year, forty percent for the eighth year, twenty percent for the ninth year, and zero percent thereafter. If a wind farm begins producing power for the first time between October first and December thirty-first in a calendar year, any revenues generated for that time period must be retained by the school district and that time period may not be counted against the first five-year period; (16) \"Per student equivalent,\" for funding calculations that are determined on a per student basis, the per student equivalent is calculated as follows: (a) Multiply the target teacher compensation times the sum of one plus the overhead rate; and (b) Divide subsection (a) by 15; (17) \"Monthly cash balance,\" the total amount of money for each month in the school district's general fund, calculated by adding all deposits made during the month to the beginning cash balance and deducting all disbursements or payments made during the month; (18) \"General fund base percentage,\" is determined as follows: (a) Forty percent for a school district with a fall enrollment as defined in subdivision (2) of two hundred or less; (b) Thirty percent for a school district with fall enrollment as defined in subdivision (2) of more than two hundred but less than six hundred; and (c) Twenty-five percent for a school district with fall enrollment as defined in subdivision (2) greater than or equal to six hundred. When determining the general fund base percentage, the secretary of the Department of Education shall use the lesser of the school district's fall enrollment as defined in subdivision (2) for the current school year or the school district's fall enrollment from the previous two years; and (19) \"Allowable general fund cash balance,\" the general fund base percentage multiplied by the district's general fund expenditures in the previous school year. Section 25. That chapter 13-13 be amended with a NEW SECTION: A sponsoring school district shall forward to the Oceti Sakowin community-based school that portion of the total funding received by the district in accordance with this chapter, that equals the percentage of the district's students who are enrolled in the Oceti Sakowin community-based school. The sponsoring school district is responsible for the provision of services required by chapter 13-37. Nothing in this section impairs any collateral pledge of state aid for debt incurred by a sponsoring school district prior to July 1, 2022."}], "amendments": [{"bill_id": 23292, "document_id": 235541,
