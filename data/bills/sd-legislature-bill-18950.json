BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. Each agency and department over which the Governor has executive authority shall seek to achieve an increase in renewable energy consumption in all buildings they own, lease, or operate of seven percent by 2010 relative to the 2000 levels and fifteen percent by 2015. Renewable energy includes energy derived from wind, solar, and biomass sources. No such buildings are exempt from these goals except as provided in rules promulgated pursuant to chapter 1-26 by the Public Utilities Commission. Section 2. Each state agency shall select energy star energy-efficient products when acquiring new energy-using products or replacing existing equipment. The Public Utilities Commission shall promulgate rules pursuant to chapter 1-26 to establish guidelines designating target energy efficiency levels for those products for which energy star labels are not yet available. For purposes of this section, the term, energy star, refers to the energy star label used in the voluntary labeling program administered by the United States Environmental Protection Agency and the United States Department of Energy to identify and promote energy efficient products. Section 3. Each agency and department over which the Governor has executive authority shall provide all reasonable assistance and cooperation requested by the Public Utilities Commission in the implementation of this Act. The assistance may include the assignment of staff and support services."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 18950, "action_date": "2004-01-22T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 99662, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/99662.pdf", "status_text": "First read in Senate and referred to", "journal_page": 114, "committee_id_action": 832, "committee_id_assigned": 814, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 18950, "action_date": "2004-01-26T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 99830, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/99830.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 814, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 18950, "action_date": "2004-01-28T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 100121, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/100121.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 814, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 18950, "action_date": "2004-01-28T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 100121, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/100121.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to 36th legislative day", "journal_page": 198, "committee_id_action": 814, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 58636, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [3093, 3109, 3120, 3146, 3065, 3050], "Nay": [3137, 3139]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/18950"}
