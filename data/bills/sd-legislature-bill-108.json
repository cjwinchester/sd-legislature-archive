The secretary of the Department of Education shall compute state aid to education for each school district under the foundation program according to the following calculations: (1) Determine each school district's fall enrollment; (2) To arrive at the local need per district: (a) Multiply the per student allocation by the fall enrollment; (b) Multiply the small school adjustment, if applicable, by the fall enrollment; and (c) Calculate the limited English proficiency (LEP) adjustment pursuant to subdivision (2D), if applicable; and (d) Add the product of subsection (a) to the product of subsection (b) and to the calculation in subsection (c); (3) State aid is (a) local need minus local effort, or (b) zero if the calculation in (a) is a negative number; (4) If the state aid appropriation for the general support of education is in excess of the entitlement provided for in this section and the entitlement provided for in \u00a7 13-13-85, the excess shall be used to fund any shortfall of the appropriation as provided for in \u00a7 13-37-36.3. The secretary shall report to the Governor by January seventh of each year, the amount of state aid necessary to fully fund the general aid formula in the current year. If a shortfall in the state aid appropriation for general education exists that cannot be covered by \u00a7 13-37-45, the Governor shall inform the Legislature and provide a proposal to eliminate the
