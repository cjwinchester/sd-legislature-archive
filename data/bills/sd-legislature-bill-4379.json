BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 36-15-54 be amended to read as follows: 36-15-54. Cosmetology, nail technology, and esthetics may only be practiced in a licensed salon or booth, except as provided in this section. A demonstrator, while demonstrating under the provisions of this chapter may practice cosmetology for compensation, fee, or any other remuneration outside of the premises of a licensed salon. In addition, a licensee may practice cosmetology services on persons unable to come to the salon because of imprisonment, disabling sickness, or other disability as long as the licensee documents the service through a salon or booth. A licensed nursing facility that permits cosmetology services only to its residents and does not advertise as a salon is not required to have a salon license. A licensee may practice cosmetology, nail technology, and esthetic services at a customer's private residence, place of business, hotel or motel room, or other venue the customer keeps, maintains, or controls if the licensee maintains, at a licensed salon, a complete record of any such services provided including the date, time, and place the services were performed and the fee charged."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 4379, "action_date": "2013-01-28T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 24817, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/24817.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 214, "committee_id_action": 202, "committee_id_assigned": 188, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 4379, "action_date": "2013-02-04T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 24992, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/24992.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 188, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 4379, "action_date": "2013-02-06T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 25188, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/25188.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 188, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 4379, "action_date": "2013-02-06T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 25365, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/25365.pdf", "status_text": "Tabled", "journal_page": 323, "committee_id_action": 188, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 13473, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [415, 349, 318, 344, 375, 380, 395, 390, 399, 401, 360, 343], "Excused": [411]}}]}
