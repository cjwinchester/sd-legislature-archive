BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. If a person with a valid license to take a mountain lion encounters a mountain lion in the course of ordinary farming or ranching activities on land that the person owns or leases, the person may legally take the mountain lion regardless of whether dogs are present at the site and regardless of the type of firearm that the person utilizes to take the mountain lion. However, nothing in this Act waives any other statue or rule in regard to the hunting and taking of mountain lions. Section 2. The provisions of this Act are retroactive to December 8, 2010. Any mountain lions taken in accordance with the provisions of section 1 of this Act is hereby validated notwithstanding the provisions of ARSD 41:06:61:06(4) and ARSD 41:06:61:06(5). 180 copies were printed on recycled paper by the South Dakota Legislative Research Council at a cost of $.063 per page. .
