If the result is less than zero, (1) equals zero; (2) Determine the lower of the general fund base percentage or the general fund balance percentage; (3) Subtract twenty percent (0.2) from the result of (2). If the result is less than zero, (3) equals zero; (4) Multiply the result of (3) by the district's general fund expenditures in the previous school fiscal year; (5) Multiply the result of (4) by the imputed interest rate; (6) Add the result of (1) and the result of (5). (1) Determine the general fund balance percentage; (2) Subtract forty percent (0.4) from the result of (1). If the result is less than zero, (2) equals zero; (3) Multiply the results of (2) by the district's general fund expenditures in the previous school fiscal year; (4) Multiply the result of (3) by the imputed interest rate.

The district of residence prior to the custodial transfer may not include students who meet these criteria in its general enrollment average daily membership after the student ceases to attend school in the resident district; (2) \"Adjusted average daily membership,\" calculated as follows: (a) For districts with an average daily membership of two hundred or less, multiply 1.2 times the average daily membership; (b) For districts with an average daily membership of less than six hundred, but greater than two hundred, raise the average daily membership to the 0.8293 power and multiply the result times 2.98; (c) For districts with an average daily membership of six hundred or more, multiply 1.0 times their average daily membership; (3) \"Index factor,\" is the annual percentage change in the consumer price index for urban wage earners and clerical workers as computed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the United States Department of Labor for the year before the year immediately preceding the year of adjustment or three percent, whichever is less; (4) \"Per student allocation,\" for school fiscal year 2005 is $4,086.56.

However, the general fund base percentage can never increase and can never be less than twenty percent; (10) \"Allowable general fund balance,\" the fund base percentage multiplied by the district's general fund expenditures in the previous school fiscal year; (11) \"Imputed interest rate,\" the average prime rate for the preceding fiscal year minus 2.5 percentage points; (12) (10) \"General fund exclusions,\" revenue a school district has received from the imposition of the excess tax levy pursuant to \u00a7 10-12-43; revenue a school district has received from gifts, contributions, grants, or donations; revenue a school district has received under the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 13-6-92 to 13-6-96, inclusive; and any revenue in the general fund set aside for a noninsurable judgment from Title VIII of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 receipted into the general fund ."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 19610, "action_date": "2005-01-11T12:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 102699, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/102699.pdf", "status_text": "First read in Senate and referred to", "journal_page": 26, "committee_id_action": 861, "committee_id_assigned": 836, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 19610, "action_date": "2005-01-18T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 102817, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/102817.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 836, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 19610, "action_date": "2005-01-25T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 103132, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/103132.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 836, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 19610, "action_date": "2005-01-25T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 103132, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/103132.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to 41st legislative day", "journal_page": 156, "committee_id_action": 836, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 61028, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [3165, 3201, 3221, 3228, 3154, 3224], "Nay": [3204]}}]}
