BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That chapter 43-13 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Any property owner may grant an easement for any underground pipeline facility for the transmission and distribution of water, natural gas, crude oil, ethanol, or refined petroleum products in the same manner and with the same effect as a conveyance of an interest in real property. The easement shall be created in writing. A complete copy of the easement agreement shall be filed, and the easement duly recorded and indexed, in the office of the register of deeds of the county in which the easement is granted. Any such easement runs with the land or lands benefited and burdened and terminates upon the conditions stated in the easement. Any such easement is void if the pipeline is not installed and in operation within ten years after the easement took effect. Any such easement is void if the pipeline transmission and distribution operations associated with the easement have ceased for a period of not less than one year. No such easement applies to any new or separate pipeline not included within the terms of the original easement. If the easement holder mortgages or otherwise encumbers to any party any part of the easement holder's rights and interests under the easement, the property owner shall be notified of the mortgage or encumbrance. Any such mortgage or encumbrance on the easement is the responsibility of the easement holder and does not attach to the land or obligate the property owner. Each pipeline easement agreement shall include a statement disclosing that the easement holder may mortgage or encumber any part of the easement holder's rights and interests under the agreement unless otherwise specified in the agreement."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 966, "action_date": "2009-02-03T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 6759, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/6759.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 269, "committee_id_action": 56, "committee_id_assigned": 49, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 966, "action_date": "2009-02-18T16:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 7414, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/7414.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 49, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 966, "action_date": "2009-02-19T16:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 7495, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/7495.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 49, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 966, "action_date": "2009-02-19T16:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 7848, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/7848.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to the 41st legislative day", "journal_page": 455, "committee_id_action": 49, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 4358, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [666, 651, 660, 693, 721, 683, 695, 645, 639, 681, 657, 691, 643]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/966"}
