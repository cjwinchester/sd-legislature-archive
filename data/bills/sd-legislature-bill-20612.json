South Dakota law permits these higher charges because short-term small loans might otherwise not be available to consumers. If you have another source of a loan, you may be able to benefit from a lower interest rate and other loan charges.\" The notice may not contain any other statement or information, unless the division has determined that the additional statement or information is necessary to prevent confusion or inaccuracy. The notice shall be designed with a type size that is large enough to be readily noticeable and legible. The form of the notice shall be approved by the division before its use.

The division may assess against the lender a fee covering the necessary costs of an investigation under this section. The division may maintain an action for the recovery of the costs in a court of competent jurisdiction."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 20612, "action_date": "2006-01-23T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 107070, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/107070.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 180, "committee_id_action": 893, "committee_id_assigned": 881, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 20612, "action_date": "2006-02-02T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 107783, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/107783.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 881, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 20612, "action_date": "2006-02-02T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 107783, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/107783.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to 36th legislative day", "journal_page": 339, "committee_id_action": 881, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 64032, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [3366, 3381, 3406, 3418, 3437, 3446, 3465, 3445, 3448], "Nay": [3367, 3380, 3419, 3451]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/20612"}
