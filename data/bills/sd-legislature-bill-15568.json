That \u00a7 32-5B-1.1 be amended to read as follows: 32-5B-1.1.

To initially qualify for the credit there must be a total loss of the vehicle subject to the previous lease, a new lease must be executed or a vehicle must be substituted under the original lease. To qualify for the credit, the new lease or substituted vehicle under the original lease shall be executed by the same lessor and lessee, for lease of a vehicle of the same or similar make, model, year, and options as the vehicle subject to the previous lease, for the remaining lease period of the previous lease, and for the same lease price. The lease shall contain the same lease terms as the previous lease."}, {"bill_id": 15568, "bill_version_id": 87202, "bill_version": "Enrolled", "bill_version_date": "2000-02-16T00:00:00-06:00",
