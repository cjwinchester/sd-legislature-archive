If the director of equalization classifies the property as a leased residential property, the property shall retain the classification until such time as the property ownership is transferred or the property has a change in use. The new owner of the transferred property which is already classified as a leased residential property may meet the requirements of this section by completing and filing the certificate of value required pursuant to \u00a7 7-9-7 at the time of the transfer of the property.

By December first of each year, the Department of Revenue shall approve the levies of all property taxing jurisdictions in the state certifying that the property tax jurisdictions have not exceeded the maximums prescribed in law before any tax levies are extended by the county auditor. Section 6. That \u00a7 10-6-31 be amended to read as follows: 10-6-31. For the purposes of taxation, all property is hereby classified into the following classes: (1) Agricultural property; (2) Nonagricultural property; (3) Owner-occupied single-family dwellings; and (4) Nonagricultural acreage property Leased residential property. Agricultural property includes all property and land used exclusively for agricultural purposes, both tilled and untilled, and the improvements on the land. However, agricultural property does not include any normally occupied dwelling or automobile garage or portion of a building used for that purpose by the occupant of such dwelling. Owner-occupied single-family dwellings include all property classified pursuant to \u00a7 10-13-39 and nonagricultural acreage property includes leased residential property includes all property classified pursuant to \u00a7 10-6-33.14 section 1 of this Act.

That \u00a7 13-11-10 be amended to read as follows: 13-11-10. In implementing the terms of \u00a7 13-11-9, a separate weighted average tax levy of the receiving districts shall be calculated for agricultural property, owner-occupied single-family dwelling property, leased residential property, and for nonagricultural property for each sending school district as follows: (1) The levy per thousand dollars of taxable valuation for agricultural property for each receiving school district shall be multiplied by the number of children from the sending school district to whom the receiving school district is providing educational services; (2) Add together the products from subdivision (1) for each receiving school district; (3) Divide the sum from subdivision (2) by the total number of students that the contracting school district is sending to the receiving school districts pursuant to \u00a7 13-15-1.3. The quotient is the weighted average tax levy per one thousand dollars of taxable valuation for agricultural property; (4) The weighted average tax levy per thousand dollars of taxable valuation for owner-occupied single-family dwellings, leased residential property, and nonagricultural property shall be obtained by repeating the procedure outlined in subdivisions (1) to (3), inclusive, for each class of property; and (5) The sum of the levies assessed for all funds in the sending district shall be equal to or greater than the sum of all levies for all funds in the receiving district. The above calculations do not include students receiving educational services from an out-of-state school district nor the tax levy of any out-of-state school district. Section 8. That \u00a7 13-13-72.1 be amended to read as follows: 13-13-72.1. Any adjustments in the levies specified in \u00a7 10-12-42 made pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 13-13-71 and 13-13-72 shall be based on maintaining the relationship between statewide local effort as a percentage of statewide local need in the fiscal year succeeding the fiscal year in which the adjustment is made. However, for fiscal year 2013 and each year thereafter, if the levies specified in \u00a7 10-12-42 are not adjusted to maintain this relationship, the per student allocation as defined in \u00a7 subdivision 13-13-10.1(4) shall be reduced to maintain the relationship between statewide local effort as a percentage of statewide local need. Any adjustment to the levy for agricultural property shall be based upon the change in the statewide agricultural taxable valuation and the reclassification of agricultural property to another property classification. Any adjustment to the levies for nonagricultural property, leased residential property, and owner-occupied single-family dwellings shall be based upon the change in the statewide nonagricultural property, leased residential property, and owner-occupied single-family dwellings taxable valuations. However, if any new project with a total taxable valuation of one hundred fifty million dollars or more is constructed, the levies shall be proportionately decreased for agricultural property, nonagricultural property, leased residential property, and owner-occupied single-family dwellings. In addition to the adjustments in the levies provided by this section, the levies shall also be annually adjusted as necessary to reduce the portion of local need paid by local effort by an amount equal to nine million dollars from those funds transferred into the property tax reduction fund pursuant to \u00a7 10-50-52 subsequent to July 1, 2007. In addition to the adjustments in the levies provided by this section, the levies for nonagricultural property and owner-occupied single-family dwellings shall also be adjusted as necessary to account for the additional increase in the total assessed value for nonagricultural property and owner-occupied single-family dwellings pursuant to the phasing out and repeal of the provisions provided in \u00a7 10-6-74.

If the district's levies are less than the maximum levies as stated in this section, the levies shall maintain the same proportion to each other as represented in the mathematical relationship at the maximum levies; and (4) The maximum tax levy for a leased residential property as defined in section 1 of this Act for such school district shall be eight dollars and sixty-two and eight tenths cents per thousand dollars of taxable valuation. If the district's levies are less than the maximum levies as stated in this section, the levies shall maintain the same proportion to each other as represented in the mathematical relationship at the maximum levies. All levies in this section shall be imposed on valuations where the median level of assessment represents eighty-five percent of market value as determined by the Department of Revenue. These valuations shall be used for all school funding purposes. If the district has imposed an excess levy pursuant to \u00a7 10-12-43, the levies shall maintain the same proportion to each other as represented in the mathematical relationship at the maximum levies in this section. The school district may elect to tax at less than the maximum amounts set forth in this section."}, {"bill_id": 4261, "bill_version_id": 25939, "bill_version": "House Taxation Engrossed", "bill_version_date": "2013-02-19T12:24:28.023-06:00", "bill_text": "FOR AN ACT ENTITLED, An Act to create a leased residential property classification and to establish the school district general fund levy for the property classification.

Section 6. That \u00a7 10-6-31 be amended to read as follows: 10-6-31. For the purposes of taxation, all property is hereby classified into the following classes: (1) Agricultural property; (2) Nonagricultural property; (3) Owner-occupied single-family dwellings; and (4) Nonagricultural acreage property Leased residential property. Agricultural property includes all property and land used exclusively for agricultural purposes, both tilled and untilled, and the improvements on the land. However, agricultural property does not include any normally occupied dwelling or automobile garage or portion of a building used for that purpose by the occupant of such dwelling. Owner-occupied single-family dwellings include all property classified pursuant to \u00a7 10-13-39 and nonagricultural acreage property includes leased residential property includes all property classified pursuant to \u00a7 10-6-33.14 section 1 of this Act.

That \u00a7 13-11-10 be amended to read as follows: 13-11-10. In implementing the terms of \u00a7 13-11-9, a separate weighted average tax levy of the receiving districts shall be calculated for agricultural property, owner-occupied single-family dwelling property, leased residential property, and for nonagricultural property for each sending school district as follows: (1) The levy per thousand dollars of taxable valuation for agricultural property for each receiving school district shall be multiplied by the number of children from the sending school district to whom the receiving school district is providing educational services; (2) Add together the products from subdivision (1) for each receiving school district; (3) Divide the sum from subdivision (2) by the total number of students that the contracting school district is sending to the receiving school districts pursuant to \u00a7 13-15-1.3. The quotient is the weighted average tax levy per one thousand dollars of taxable valuation for agricultural property; (4) The weighted average tax levy per thousand dollars of taxable valuation for owner-occupied single-family dwellings, leased residential property, and nonagricultural property shall be obtained by repeating the procedure outlined in subdivisions (1) to (3), inclusive, for each class of property; and (5) The sum of the levies assessed for all funds in the sending district shall be equal to or greater than the sum of all levies for all funds in the receiving district. The above calculations do not include students receiving educational services from an out-of-state school district nor the tax levy of any out-of-state school district. Section 8. That \u00a7 13-13-72.1 be amended to read as follows: 13-13-72.1. Any adjustments in the levies specified in \u00a7 10-12-42 made pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 13-13-71 and 13-13-72 shall be based on maintaining the relationship between statewide local effort as a percentage of statewide local need in the fiscal year succeeding the fiscal year in which the adjustment is made. However, for fiscal year 2013 and each year thereafter, if the levies specified in \u00a7 10-12-42 are not adjusted to maintain this relationship, the per student allocation as defined in \u00a7 subdivision 13-13-10.1(4) shall be reduced to maintain the relationship between statewide local effort as a percentage of statewide local need. Any adjustment to the levy for agricultural property shall be based upon the change in the statewide agricultural taxable valuation and the reclassification of agricultural property to another property classification. Any adjustment to the levies for nonagricultural property, leased residential property, and owner-occupied single-family dwellings shall be based upon the change in the statewide nonagricultural property, leased residential property, and owner-occupied single-family dwellings taxable valuations. However, if any new project with a total taxable valuation of one hundred fifty million dollars or more is constructed, the levies shall be proportionately decreased for agricultural property, nonagricultural property, leased residential property, and owner-occupied single-family dwellings. In addition to the adjustments in the levies provided by this section, the levies shall also be annually adjusted as necessary to reduce the portion of local need paid by local effort by an amount equal to nine million dollars from those funds transferred into the property tax reduction fund pursuant to \u00a7 10-50-52 subsequent to July 1, 2007. In addition to the adjustments in the levies provided by this section, the levies for nonagricultural property and owner-occupied single-family dwellings shall also be adjusted as necessary to account for the additional increase in the total assessed value for nonagricultural property and owner-occupied single-family dwellings pursuant to the phasing out and repeal of the provisions provided in \u00a7 10-6-74. Section 9. That \u00a7 10-12-42 be amended to read as follows: 10-12-42. For taxes payable in 2013 and each year thereafter, the levy for the general fund of a school district shall be as follows: (1) The maximum tax levy shall be eight dollars and sixty-two and eight tenth cents per thousand dollars of taxable valuation subject to the limitations on agricultural property as provided in subdivision (2) of this section, and owner-occupied property as provided in subdivision (3) of this section, and leased residential property as provided in subdivision (4) of this section; (2) The maximum tax levy on agricultural property for such school district shall be two dollars and thirty-two and two tenths cents per thousand dollars of taxable valuation. If the district's levies are less than the maximum levies as stated in this section, the levies shall maintain the same proportion to each other as represented in the mathematical relationship at the maximum levies; and (3) The maximum tax levy for an owner-occupied single-family dwelling as defined in \u00a7 10-13-40 for such school district shall be four dollars and two and nine tenths cents per thousand dollars of taxable valuation. If the district's levies are less than the maximum levies as stated in this section, the levies shall maintain the same proportion to each other as represented in the mathematical relationship at the maximum levies; and (4) The maximum tax levy for a leased residential property as defined in section 1 of this Act for such school district shall be eight dollars and sixty-two and eight tenths cents per thousand dollars of taxable valuation. If the district's levies are less than the maximum levies as stated in this section, the levies shall maintain the same proportion to each other as represented in the mathematical relationship at the maximum levies. All levies in this section shall be imposed on valuations where the median level of assessment represents eighty-five percent of market value as determined by the Department of Revenue. These valuations shall be used for all school funding purposes. If the district has imposed an excess levy pursuant to \u00a7 10-12-43, the levies shall maintain the same proportion to each other as represented in the mathematical relationship at the maximum levies in this section. The school district may elect to tax at less than the maximum amounts set forth in this section. Section 10.
