A franchise is offered in this state if: (1) An offer to sell is made in this state; (2) The offer originates from within this state; or (3) The offer is directed by the offeror into this state from outside this state and is received where directed. A franchise is sold in this state if the offer to sell is accepted in this state. A franchise is offered or sold in this state if the franchise is offered or sold to a resident of this state and the franchise is to be operated in this state, or, if the franchisee is domiciled in this state when the franchised business is or will be operated in this state. Section 3. An offer to sell is not made in this state solely because the offer appears in a newspaper or other publication of general and regular circulation which had more than two- thirds of its circulation outside this state during the past twelve months or solely because the offer appears in a broadcast or transmission originating outside this state. An offer to sell or to purchase is not made in this state if the offer to sell is made over the internet or similar proprietary or common carrier electronic system if the following conditions are met: (1) The internet offer indicates that the franchise is not being offered to residents of South Dakota; (2) The internet offer is not directed to any person in South Dakota by or on behalf of the franchisor or anyone acting with the franchisor's knowledge; and (3) No franchise is sold in South Dakota by or on behalf of the franchisor until the offering has been filed by notice and the franchise disclosure document has been delivered to the purchaser prior to the sale and in compliance with this Act. An offer or sale of a franchise is not made in this state if the offer or sale is made to a person not a resident of this state, if the franchise will not be located in this state, and if the offer or sale does not constitute a violation of the laws of the state or foreign jurisdiction in which the offeree or purchaser is present and is not part of an unlawful attempt to evade this Act. Section 4. It is unlawful for any person to offer or sell a franchise in this state unless the franchise has properly notice filed under this Act or is exempt from notice filing pursuant to sections 12 to 15, inclusive, of this Act. Section 5. An initial application for the notice filing of a franchise shall be made by filing with the director of the Division of Securities a franchise notice filing application and one clean copy of the disclosure document and consent to service of process, accompanied by a fee of two hundred fifty dollars. If after considering identified conditions and events and management's plans, the auditor concludes that there is substantial doubt about the franchisor's ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time, the director shall be notified by separate letter as to the going concern issue with the notice filing application. After a notice filing becomes effective, the applicant has a continuing obligation to notify the director of a going concern within fifteen days after the auditor concludes there is a going concern. Except as otherwise provided in this section, if no order or injunction pursuant to section 41 or 48 of this Act is in effect, and the filing is complete as required by this section, a notice filing is effective upon receipt by the director. If the director requires the submission of additional information pursuant to section 6 or 36 of this Act, and if no order or injunction pursuant to section 41 or 48 of this Act is in effect, the notice filing becomes effective on the fifteenth business day after the additional information is filed with and approved by the director, or at such earlier time as the director determines, unless the applicant requests postponement of the effectiveness of the notice filing. Business day means any day on which state offices are open for regular business. The notice filing of a franchise under this Act expires one year following the date of receipt of the initial application, unless the director prescribes a different period by rule or order. A notice filing may be renewed for one year or a shorter period if designated by the director by filing an application to renew in the same manner as set forth in this section, except that the renewal fee is one hundred fifty dollars. Any filing received after the expiration date shall be treated as an initial filing subject to a filing fee of two hundred fifty dollars. An applicant may withdraw a notice filing if the applicant files a written request for withdrawal with the director. Withdrawal is effective fifteen days from the day on which the withdrawal request is filed unless a shorter period is designated by the director. The director may by rule or order construe any public offering, disclosure document, or similar statement which complies with the requirements of any federal law or administrative rule or with the law of any other state requiring substantially the same disclosure of information as is required by this Act to be in full or partial compliance with this section. The director may by rule or order provide that any information required in the disclosure document need not be included by any class of franchisors if the director finds that the information is inappropriate to the class and that disclosure adequate for the protection of prospective franchisees is otherwise included within the disclosure document. The director may accept any disclosure document or other document filed with the director in an electronic format that is readily accessible by the Division of Securities' then existing electronic systems and in a format that can be downloaded, printed, or otherwise maintained as a record for future reference. If the director accepts electronic filings, the director shall publish a notice on the division's website stating the acceptance of electronic filing and the electronic format to be used. If the franchisor is unable to demonstrate to the director the franchisor's financial ability to fulfill its initial obligations to franchisees, the director may require an escrow of funds paid by the franchisee to the franchisor or its affiliate until the franchisor performs its initial obligations and the franchisee has commenced operations. The director may allow alternatives to escrow depending upon the various facts presented on a case by case basis. Section 6. The director may require the franchisor to alter or amend the proposed disclosure document in order to assure full and fair disclosure to prospective purchasers. Section 7. There is no filing required with the division for updating disclosure documents; but disclosure information shall be updated as follows: (1) Any information in the disclosure document shall be current as of the close of the franchisor's most recent fiscal year. After the close of the fiscal year, the franchisor shall, within one hundred twenty days, prepare a revised disclosure document, after which a franchise seller may distribute only the revised document and no other disclosure document; (2) The franchisor shall, within a reasonable time after the close of each quarter of the fiscal year, prepare revisions to be attached to the disclosure document to reflect any material change to the disclosures included, or required to be included, in the disclosure document. Each prospective franchisee shall receive the disclosure document and the quarterly revisions for the most recent period available at the time of disclosure; (3) If applicable, the annual update shall include the franchisor's first quarterly update, either by incorporating the quarterly update information into the disclosure document itself, or through an addendum; (4) When furnishing a disclosure document, the franchise seller shall notify the prospective franchisee of any material changes that the seller knows or should have known occurred in the information contained in any financial performance presentation; and (5) Information that must be audited pursuant to the disclosure requirements need not be audited for quarterly revisions if the franchisor states in immediate conjunction with the information that the information was not audited. Section 8. For the purposes of section 7 of this Act, a start-up franchise system that does not yet have audited financial statements, may phase-in the use of audited financial statements by providing, at a minimum, the following statements in the times indicated below: (1) The franchisor's first partial or full fiscal year selling franchises: an unaudited opening balance sheet; (2) The franchisor's second fiscal year selling franchises: audited balance sheet opinion as of the end of the first partial or full fiscal year selling franchises; and (3) The franchisor's third and subsequent fiscal years selling franchises: all required financial statements for the previous fiscal year, plus any previously disclosed audited statements that still must be disclosed such as the franchisor's balance sheet for the previous two fiscal year-ends before the disclosure document issuance date and statements of operations, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the franchisor's previous three fiscal years. Section 9. For the purposes of section 7 of this Act, a start-up franchisor may phase-in the disclosure of audited financial statements, if the franchisor: (1) Prepares audited financial statements as soon as practicable; (2) Prepares unaudited statements in a format that conforms as closely as possible to audited statements; and (3) Includes one or more years of unaudited financial statements or clearly and conspicuously discloses in the disclosure document that the franchisor has not been in business for three years or more, and cannot include all of the financial statements required in the disclosure document such as the franchisor's balance sheet for the previous two fiscal year-ends before the disclosure document issuance date and statements of operations, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the franchisor's previous three fiscal years. Section 10. This Act does not prevent the negotiation of the terms and conditions of a franchise before it is sold. After the initial offer, a franchisor need not amend its disclosure document to negotiate with an offeree, or make supplementary disclosure to that offeree, by reason of a change negotiated in the terms and conditions of a franchise. Section 11. The person offering or selling any franchise subject to the requirements of sections 17 and 18 of this Act shall obtain a receipt, signed by the prospective franchisee, acknowledging that the prospective franchisee has received a copy of the disclosure document prior to the prospective franchisee affixing a signature to any franchise or other agreement and prior to the payment of any consideration by the prospective franchisee. The receipt shall be kept in the possession of the franchise seller, subject to inspection by the director, for a period of three years from the date the receipt is taken. Section 12. The following are exempt from this Act: (1) Any franchise relationship covered by the Petroleum Marketing Practices Act, 15 U.S.C. 2801, as of January 1, 2008; (2) Any franchise relationship where there is no written document that describes any material term or aspect of the relationship or arrangement; (3) Any fractional franchise; (4) Any leased department; (5) The total of the required payments, or commitments to make a required payment, to the franchisor or an affiliate that are made any time from before to within six months after commencing operation of the franchisee's business is less than five hundred dollars; (6) Any franchise relationship covering farm machinery, motor vehicles, or recreational vehicles, including snowmobiles, motorcycles, motor homes, mobile homes, and manufactured homes. Section 13. The following franchises are subject to this Act but are exempt from section 4 and 17 of this Act, if any of the following conditions are satisfied: (1) The franchisee's initial investment, excluding any financing received from the franchisor or an affiliate, and excluding the cost of unimproved land, totals at least one million dollars and the prospective franchisee signs an acknowledgment verifying the grounds for the exemption. The acknowledgment shall state: The franchise sale is for more than one million dollars, excluding the cost of unimproved land and any financing received from the franchisor or an affiliate; or the franchisee (or its parent or any affiliates) is an entity that has been in business for at least five years and has a net worth of at least five million dollars; or (2) The offer or sale of a franchise by an executor, administrator, sheriff, marshal, receiver, trustee, trustee in bankruptcy, guardian, or conservator on behalf of a person other than the franchisor or the estate of the franchisor. Section 14. The following franchises are subject to this Act but are exempt from section 4 of this Act if any of the following conditions are satisfied: (1) One or more purchasers of at least a fifty percent ownership interest in the franchise: within sixty days of the sale, has been, for at least two years, an officer, director, general partner, individual with management responsibility for the offer and sale of the franchisor's franchises or the administrator of the franchised network; or within sixty days of the sale, has been, for at least two years, an owner of at least a twenty- five percent interest in the franchisor; (2) The offer or sale to an existing franchisee of an additional franchise that is substantially the same as the franchise that the franchisee has operated for at least two years at the time of the offer or sale; or (3) The offer or sale of a franchise to a bank, saving and loan association, financial organization or life insurance corporation within the meanings given these terms by chapters 43-41B, 52-1, and 58-1. Section 15. The director may by rule or order exclude the offer and sale of a franchise from the requirements of sections 4 and 17 of this Act if the filing or disclosure is not necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of prospective franchisees. Section 16. For purposes of the exemptions set forth in subdivision (5) of section 12 of this Act and subdivision (1) of section 13 of this Act, the director may adjust by rule or order the size of the thresholds. Section 17. In connection with the offer or sale of a franchise in this state, unless the transaction is exempted by the provisions of sections 12 to 16, inclusive, of this Act, it is a prohibited practice and a violation of this Act for any person, directly or indirectly, to: (1) Fail to furnish a prospective franchisee with a copy of the franchisor's current disclosure document at least fourteen calendar-days before the prospective franchisee signs a binding agreement with, or makes any payment to, the franchisor or an affiliate in connection with the proposed franchise sale; (2) Alter unilaterally and materially the terms and conditions of the basic franchise agreement or any related agreements attached to the disclosure document without furnishing the prospective franchisee with a copy of each revised agreement at least seven calendar-days before the prospective franchisee signs the revised agreement. Any change to an agreement that arises out of negotiations initiated by the prospective franchisee does not trigger this seven calendar-day period; or (3) Fail to include all of the information required in the disclosure document if preparing the disclosure document to be furnished to a prospective franchisee. A franchise seller is liable for a violation of this subdivision if the seller either directly participated in the preparation of the disclosure document or had the authority to control those who did. Section 18. For purposes of subdivision (1) and (2) of section 17 of this Act, the franchisor has furnished the disclosure documents by the required date if: (1) A copy of the disclosure document was hand-delivered, faxed, e-mailed, or otherwise delivered to the prospective franchisee by the required date; (2) Directions for accessing the disclosure document on the internet were provided to the prospective franchisee by the required date; or (3) A paper or tangible electronic copy was sent to the address specified by the prospective franchisee by first-class United States mail at least three days before the required date. Section 19. Every franchisor offering or selling a franchise in this state shall maintain complete and accurate books and records of the offers and sales of franchises. The books and records shall include all of the disclosure documents and advertising and correspondence that have been used with franchisees and prospective franchisees including past and present operations manuals, training records, training manuals, copies of executed agreements, and any due diligence records concerning franchisees. The books and records shall be maintained at an office readily accessible to the franchisor for three years. The books and records may be kept on photographic or electronic media but shall be printed if the director requests. Section 20. In any proceeding under this Act the burden of proving an exemption is upon the person claiming it. Section 21. A written provision in a franchise contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising out of the contract or transaction, or the refusal to perform the whole or any part thereof, or an agreement in writing to submit to arbitration an existing controversy arising out of the contract, transaction, or refusal, is valid, irrevocable, and enforceable except upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract. However, any condition, stipulation, or provision requiring a franchisee to waive compliance with or relieving a person of a duty or liability imposed by or a right provided by this Act or a rule or order under this Act is void. Section 22. Each applicant for notice filing under this Act, and each franchisor on whose behalf an application for notice filing is filed, except any applicant and franchisor which are domestic South Dakota entities, shall file with the director an irrevocable consent to service of process. The irrevocable consent to service shall be in such form as the director may prescribe. The irrevocable consent to service of process shall appoint the director to be the applicant's or franchisor's agent to receive service of any lawful process in any civil action against the applicant or franchisor or their successor, executor, or administrator, which arises under this Act or any rule or order thereunder. After the irrevocable consent to service of process has been filed, it has the same force and validity as if served personally on the applicant or franchisor or their successor, executor, or administrator. If any person, including any nonresident of this state and any foreign corporation, or other entity engages in conduct prohibited or made actionable by this Act, whether or not they have filed a consent to service of process pursuant to this section, and personal jurisdiction over them cannot otherwise be obtained in this state, that conduct shall be considered equivalent to their appointment of the director to be their agent to receive service of any lawful process in any suit against them or their successors, executor, or administrator which grows out of that conduct and which is brought under this Act, with the same force and validity as if served on them personally. If, under this section, the director is an agent to receive process, service may be made by leaving a copy of the process in the office of the director as follows: (1) The process is not effective unless the plaintiff, who may be the director in an action instituted by the director, forthwith sends notice of the service and a copy of the process by certified mail to the defendant, or forthwith sends notice of the service and a copy of the process to the respondent at their last known address on file with the director; and (2) The plaintiff's affidavit of compliance with this section is filed with the court at the time as the filing of the complaint. Section 23. No person may publish or cause to be published in this state any advertisement concerning any franchise after the director has found that the advertisement contains any statement that is false or misleading or omits to make any statement necessary in order to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and has so notified the person by written order. The director may issue an order without prior notice or hearing. After the issuance of an order, the person desiring to use the advertisement may, in writing, request a hearing on the order. Upon the receipt of the written request, the director shall set a hearing to commence within fifteen days after the receipt of the request unless the person making the request consents to a later date. After the hearing, which shall be conducted in accordance with chapter 1-26, the director shall, by written order, either affirm, modify, or vacate the order. Unless the director requests the filing of an advertisement, there is no requirement to file advertising with the division. Section 24. No person may, directly or indirectly, employ a device, scheme, or artifice to defraud in connection with the offer or sale of a franchise. A violation of this section is a fraudulent practice and a Class 4 felony. Section 25.

The director may publish information concerning the violation of any rule, order, or provision under this Act. Section 36. The director may make a written request to any person for information concerning any investigation being conducted by the director.

Section 41.

Section 46. If a hearing is requested or ordered, the director, after notice and hearing held in accordance with chapter 1-26 shall affirm, modify, or vacate the order. Section 47. If the director has reasonable cause to believe that any person has engaged or is about to engage in any act or practice constituting a violation of any provision of this Act or any rule or order thereunder, the director may, in addition to all other remedies, through the attorney general, with such assistance as the attorney general may request of the state's attorneys in the several counties, institute a civil action pursuant to section 49 of this Act.

A franchise is offered in this state if: (1) An offer to sell is made in this state; (2) The offer originates from within this state; or (3) The offer is directed by the offeror into this state from outside this state and is received where directed. A franchise is sold in this state if the offer to sell is accepted in this state. A franchise is offered or sold in this state if the franchise is offered or sold to a resident of this state and the franchise is to be operated in this state, or, if the franchisee is domiciled in this state when the franchised business is or will be operated in this state. Section 3. An offer to sell is not made in this state solely because the offer appears in a newspaper or other publication of general and regular circulation which had more than two- thirds of its circulation outside this state during the past twelve months or solely because the offer appears in a broadcast or transmission originating outside this state. An offer to sell or to purchase is not made in this state if the offer to sell is made over the internet or similar proprietary or common carrier electronic system if the following conditions are met: (1) The internet offer indicates that the franchise is not being offered to residents of South Dakota; (2) The internet offer is not directed to any person in South Dakota by or on behalf of the franchisor or anyone acting with the franchisor's knowledge; and (3) No franchise is sold in South Dakota by or on behalf of the franchisor until the offering has been filed by notice and the franchise disclosure document has been delivered to the purchaser prior to the sale and in compliance with this Act. An offer or sale of a franchise is not made in this state if the offer or sale is made to a person not a resident of this state, if the franchise will not be located in this state, and if the offer or sale does not constitute a violation of the laws of the state or foreign jurisdiction in which the offeree or purchaser is present and is not part of an unlawful attempt to evade this Act. Section 4. It is unlawful for any person to offer or sell a franchise in this state unless the franchise has properly notice filed under this Act or is exempt from notice filing pursuant to sections 12 to 15, inclusive, of this Act. Section 5. An initial application for the notice filing of a franchise shall be made by filing with the director of the Division of Securities a franchise notice filing application and one clean copy of the disclosure document and consent to service of process, accompanied by a fee of two hundred fifty dollars. If after considering identified conditions and events and management's plans, the auditor concludes that there is substantial doubt about the franchisor's ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time, the director shall be notified by separate letter as to the going concern issue with the notice filing application. After a notice filing becomes effective, the applicant has a continuing obligation to notify the director of a going concern within fifteen days after the auditor concludes there is a going concern. Except as otherwise provided in this section, if no order or injunction pursuant to section 41 or 48 of this Act is in effect, and the filing is complete as required by this section, a notice filing is effective upon receipt by the director. If the director requires the submission of additional information pursuant to section 6 or 36 of this Act, and if no order or injunction pursuant to section 41 or 48 of this Act is in effect, the notice filing becomes effective on the fifteenth business day after the additional information is filed with and approved by the director, or at such earlier time as the director determines, unless the applicant requests postponement of the effectiveness of the notice filing. Business day means any day on which state offices are open for regular business. The notice filing of a franchise under this Act expires one year following the date of receipt of the initial application, unless the director prescribes a different period by rule or order. A notice filing may be renewed for one year or a shorter period if designated by the director by filing an application to renew in the same manner as set forth in this section, except that the renewal fee is one hundred fifty dollars. Any filing received after the expiration date shall be treated as an initial filing subject to a filing fee of two hundred fifty dollars. An applicant may withdraw a notice filing if the applicant files a written request for withdrawal with the director. Withdrawal is effective fifteen days from the day on which the withdrawal request is filed unless a shorter period is designated by the director. The director may by rule or order construe any public offering, disclosure document, or similar statement which complies with the requirements of any federal law or administrative rule or with the law of any other state requiring substantially the same disclosure of information as is required by this Act to be in full or partial compliance with this section. The director may by rule or order provide that any information required in the disclosure document need not be included by any class of franchisors if the director finds that the information is inappropriate to the class and that disclosure adequate for the protection of prospective franchisees is otherwise included within the disclosure document. The director may accept any disclosure document or other document filed with the director in an electronic format that is readily accessible by the Division of Securities' then existing electronic systems and in a format that can be downloaded, printed, or otherwise maintained as a record for future reference. If the director accepts electronic filings, the director shall publish a notice on the division's website stating the acceptance of electronic filing and the electronic format to be used. If the franchisor is unable to demonstrate to the director the franchisor's financial ability to fulfill its initial obligations to franchisees, the director may require an escrow of funds paid by the franchisee to the franchisor or its affiliate until the franchisor performs its initial obligations and the franchisee has commenced operations. The director may allow alternatives to escrow depending upon the various facts presented on a case by case basis. Section 6. The director may require the franchisor to alter or amend the proposed disclosure document in order to assure full and fair disclosure to prospective purchasers. Section 7. There is no filing required with the division for updating disclosure documents; but disclosure information shall be updated as follows: (1) Any information in the disclosure document shall be current as of the close of the franchisor's most recent fiscal year. After the close of the fiscal year, the franchisor shall, within one hundred twenty days, prepare a revised disclosure document, after which a franchise seller may distribute only the revised document and no other disclosure document; (2) The franchisor shall, within a reasonable time after the close of each quarter of the fiscal year, prepare revisions to be attached to the disclosure document to reflect any material change to the disclosures included, or required to be included, in the disclosure document. Each prospective franchisee shall receive the disclosure document and the quarterly revisions for the most recent period available at the time of disclosure; (3) If applicable, the annual update shall include the franchisor's first quarterly update, either by incorporating the quarterly update information into the disclosure document itself, or through an addendum; (4) When furnishing a disclosure document, the franchise seller shall notify the prospective franchisee of any material changes that the seller knows or should have known occurred in the information contained in any financial performance presentation; and (5) Information that must be audited pursuant to the disclosure requirements need not be audited for quarterly revisions if the franchisor states in immediate conjunction with the information that the information was not audited. Section 8. For the purposes of section 7 of this Act, a start-up franchise system that does not yet have audited financial statements, may phase-in the use of audited financial statements by providing, at a minimum, the following statements in the times indicated below: (1) The franchisor's first partial or full fiscal year selling franchises: an unaudited opening balance sheet; (2) The franchisor's second fiscal year selling franchises: audited balance sheet opinion as of the end of the first partial or full fiscal year selling franchises; and (3) The franchisor's third and subsequent fiscal years selling franchises: all required financial statements for the previous fiscal year, plus any previously disclosed audited statements that still must be disclosed such as the franchisor's balance sheet for the previous two fiscal year-ends before the disclosure document issuance date and statements of operations, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the franchisor's previous three fiscal years. Section 9. For the purposes of section 7 of this Act, a start-up franchisor may phase-in the disclosure of audited financial statements, if the franchisor: (1) Prepares audited financial statements as soon as practicable; (2) Prepares unaudited statements in a format that conforms as closely as possible to audited statements; and (3) Includes one or more years of unaudited financial statements or clearly and conspicuously discloses in the disclosure document that the franchisor has not been in business for three years or more, and cannot include all of the financial statements required in the disclosure document such as the franchisor's balance sheet for the previous two fiscal year-ends before the disclosure document issuance date and statements of operations, stockholders equity, and cash flows for each of the franchisor's previous three fiscal years. Section 10. This Act does not prevent the negotiation of the terms and conditions of a franchise before it is sold. After the initial offer, a franchisor need not amend its disclosure document to negotiate with an offeree, or make supplementary disclosure to that offeree, by reason of a change negotiated in the terms and conditions of a franchise. Section 11. The person offering or selling any franchise subject to the requirements of sections 17 and 18 of this Act shall obtain a receipt, signed by the prospective franchisee, acknowledging that the prospective franchisee has received a copy of the disclosure document prior to the prospective franchisee affixing a signature to any franchise or other agreement and prior to the payment of any consideration by the prospective franchisee. The receipt shall be kept in the possession of the franchise seller, subject to inspection by the director, for a period of three years from the date the receipt is taken. Section 12. The following are exempt from this Act: (1) Any franchise relationship covered by the Petroleum Marketing Practices Act, 15 U.S.C. 2801, as of January 1, 2008; (2) Any franchise relationship where there is no written document that describes any material term or aspect of the relationship or arrangement; (3) Any fractional franchise; (4) Any leased department; (5) The total of the required payments, or commitments to make a required payment, to the franchisor or an affiliate that are made any time from before to within six months after commencing operation of the franchisee's business is less than five hundred dollars; (6) Any franchise relationship covering farm machinery, motor vehicles, or recreational vehicles, including snowmobiles, motorcycles, motor homes, mobile homes, and manufactured homes. Section 13. The following franchises are subject to this Act but are exempt from sections 4 and 17 of this Act, if any of the following conditions are satisfied: (1) The franchisee's initial investment, excluding any financing received from the franchisor or an affiliate, and excluding the cost of unimproved land, totals at least one million dollars and the prospective franchisee signs an acknowledgment verifying the grounds for the exemption. The acknowledgment shall state: The franchise sale is for more than one million dollars, excluding the cost of unimproved land and any financing received from the franchisor or an affiliate; (2) The franchisee (or its parent or any affiliates) is an entity that has been in business for at least five years and has a net worth of at least five million dollars; or (3) The offer or sale of a franchise by an executor, administrator, sheriff, marshal, receiver, trustee, trustee in bankruptcy, guardian, or conservator on behalf of a person other than the franchisor or the estate of the franchisor; or (4) One or more purchasers of at least a fifty percent ownership interest in the franchise; within sixty days of the sale, has been, for at least two years, an officer, director, general partner, individual with management responsibility for the offer and sale of the franchisor's franchises or the administrator of the franchised network; or within sixty days of the sale, has been, for at least two years, an owner of at least a twenty- five percent interest in the franchise. Section 14. The following franchises are subject to this Act but are exempt from section 4 of this Act if any of the following conditions are satisfied: (1) The offer or sale to an existing franchisee of an additional franchise that is substantially the same as the franchise that the franchisee has operated for at least two years at the time of the offer or sale; or (2) The offer or sale of a franchise to a bank, saving and loan association, financial organization or life insurance corporation within the meanings given these terms by chapters 43-41B, 52-1, and 58-1. Section 15. The director may by rule or order exclude the offer and sale of a franchise from the requirements of sections 4 and 17 of this Act if the filing or disclosure is not necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of prospective franchisees. Section 16. For purposes of the exemptions set forth in subdivision (5) of section 12 of this Act and subdivisions (1) and (2) of section 13 of this Act, the director may adjust by rule or order the size of the thresholds. Section 17. In connection with the offer or sale of a franchise in this state, unless the transaction is exempted by the provisions of sections 12 to 16, inclusive, of this Act, it is a prohibited practice and a violation of this Act for any person, directly or indirectly, to: (1) Fail to furnish a prospective franchisee with a copy of the franchisor's current disclosure document at least fourteen calendar-days before the prospective franchisee signs a binding agreement with, or makes any payment to, the franchisor or an affiliate in connection with the proposed franchise sale; (2) Alter unilaterally and materially the terms and conditions of the basic franchise agreement or any related agreements attached to the disclosure document without furnishing the prospective franchisee with a copy of each revised agreement at least seven calendar-days before the prospective franchisee signs the revised agreement. Any change to an agreement that arises out of negotiations initiated by the prospective franchisee does not trigger this seven calendar-day period; or (3) Fail to include all of the information required in the disclosure document if preparing the disclosure document to be furnished to a prospective franchisee. A franchise seller is liable for a violation of this subdivision if the seller either directly participated in the preparation of the disclosure document or had the authority to control those who did. Section 18. For purposes of subdivision (1) and (2) of section 17 of this Act, the franchisor has furnished the disclosure documents by the required date if: (1) A copy of the disclosure document was hand-delivered, faxed, e-mailed, or otherwise delivered to the prospective franchisee by the required date; (2) Directions for accessing the disclosure document on the internet were provided to the prospective franchisee by the required date; or (3) A paper or tangible electronic copy was sent to the address specified by the prospective franchisee by first-class United States mail at least three days before the required date. Section 19. Every franchisor offering or selling a franchise in this state shall maintain complete and accurate books and records of the offers and sales of franchises. The books and records shall include all of the disclosure documents and advertising and correspondence that have been used with franchisees and prospective franchisees including past and present operations manuals, training records, training manuals, copies of executed agreements, and any due diligence records concerning franchisees. The books and records shall be maintained at an office readily accessible to the franchisor for three years. The books and records may be kept on photographic or electronic media but shall be printed if the director requests. Section 20. In any proceeding under this Act the burden of proving an exemption is upon the person claiming it. Section 21. A written provision in a franchise contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising out of the contract or transaction, or the refusal to perform the whole or any part thereof, or an agreement in writing to submit to arbitration an existing controversy arising out of the contract, transaction, or refusal, is valid, irrevocable, and enforceable except upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract. However, any condition, stipulation, or provision requiring a franchisee to waive compliance with or relieving a person of a duty or liability imposed by or a right provided by this Act or a rule or order under this Act is void. Section 22. Each applicant for notice filing under this Act, and each franchisor on whose behalf an application for notice filing is filed, except any applicant and franchisor which are domestic South Dakota entities, shall file with the director an irrevocable consent to service of process. The irrevocable consent to service shall be in such form as the director may prescribe. The irrevocable consent to service of process shall appoint the director to be the applicant's or franchisor's agent to receive service of any lawful process in any civil action against the applicant or franchisor or their successor, executor, or administrator, which arises under this Act or any rule or order thereunder. After the irrevocable consent to service of process has been filed, it has the same force and validity as if served personally on the applicant or franchisor or their successor, executor, or administrator. If any person, including any nonresident of this state and any foreign corporation, or other entity engages in conduct prohibited or made actionable by this Act, whether or not they have filed a consent to service of process pursuant to this section, and personal jurisdiction over them cannot otherwise be obtained in this state, that conduct shall be considered equivalent to their appointment of the director to be their agent to receive service of any lawful process in any suit against them or their successors, executor, or administrator which grows out of that conduct and which is brought under this Act, with the same force and validity as if served on them personally. If, under this section, the director is an agent to receive process, service may be made by leaving a copy of the process in the office of the director as follows: (1) The process is not effective unless the plaintiff, who may be the director in an action instituted by the director, forthwith sends notice of the service and a copy of the process by certified mail to the defendant, or forthwith sends notice of the service and a copy of the process to the respondent at their last known address on file with the director; and (2) The plaintiff's affidavit of compliance with this section is filed with the court at the time as the filing of the complaint. Section 23. No person may publish or cause to be published in this state any advertisement concerning any franchise after the director has found that the advertisement contains any statement that is false or misleading or omits to make any statement necessary in order to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, and has so notified the person by written order. The director may issue an order without prior notice or hearing. After the issuance of an order, the person desiring to use the advertisement may, in writing, request a hearing on the order. Upon the receipt of the written request, the director shall set a hearing to commence within fifteen days after the receipt of the request unless the person making the request consents to a later date. After the hearing, which shall be conducted in accordance with chapter 1-26, the director shall, by written order, either affirm, modify, or vacate the order. Unless the director requests the filing of an advertisement, there is no requirement to file advertising with the division. Section 24. No person may, directly or indirectly, employ a device, scheme, or artifice to defraud in connection with the offer or sale of a franchise. A violation of this section is a fraudulent practice and a Class 4 felony. Section 25. No person may, directly or indirectly, in connection with the offer or sale of a franchise willfully: (1) Make an untrue statement of material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in the light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading; (2) Engage in an act, practice, or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit on a person; (3) Represent to a prospective franchisee that the notice filing of a franchise application constitutes a finding by the director that a disclosure document filed under this Act is true, complete, and not misleading or that the director has passed upon the merits of the disclosure document and the franchise; (4) Violate an order of the director after the person receives notice that the order was issued; (5) Misrepresent that a franchise is notice filed or exempted from notice filing under this Act; and (6) Omit to state a material fact or make or cause to be made an untrue statement of a material fact in any application, notice, or report filed with the director under this Act. A violation of this section is a Class 6 felony. Section 26. No person may, directly or indirectly, in connection with the offer or sale of a franchise: (1) Make any claim or representation, orally, visually, or in writing, that contradicts the information required to be in the disclosure document; (2) Misrepresent that any person: (a) Purchased a franchise from the franchisor or operated a franchise of the type offered by the franchisor; or (b) Can provide an independent and reliable report about the franchise or the experiences of any current or former franchisees; (3) Disseminate any financial performance representations to prospective franchisees unless the franchisor has a reasonable basis and written substantiation for the representation at the time the representation is made, and the representation is included in the franchisor's disclosure document and the franchise seller: (a) Discloses the dates when the reported level of financial performance was achieved and of those outlets whose data were used in arriving at the representation, and the number and percent that actually attained or surpassed the stated results if the representation relates to the past performance of the franchisor's outlets; and (b) Includes a clear and conspicuous admonition that a new franchisee's individual financial results may differ from the result stated in the financial performance representation; (4) Fail to make available to prospective franchisees, and to the director upon reasonable request, written substantiation for any financial performance representations made in the disclosure document; (5) Fail to furnish a copy of the franchisor's disclosure document to a prospective franchisee earlier in the sales process than required by section 17 of this Act, upon reasonable request; (6) Fail to furnish a copy of the franchisor's most recent disclosure document and any quarterly updates to a prospective franchisee, upon reasonable request, before the prospective franchisee signs a franchise agreement; (7) Present for signing a franchise agreement in which the terms and conditions differ materially from those presented as an attachment to the disclosure document, unless the franchise seller informed the prospective franchisee of the differences at least seven days before execution of the franchise agreement; (8) Disclaim or require a prospective franchisee to waive reliance on any representation made in the disclosure document or in its exhibits or amendments. However, this provision is not intended to prevent a prospective franchisee from voluntarily waiving specific contractual terms and conditions set forth in his or her disclosure document during the course of franchise sale negotiations; and (9) Fail to return any funds or deposits in accordance with any conditions disclosed in the franchisor's disclosure document, franchise agreement, or any related document. Section 27. The director may not approve or express any opinion on the legality of any matter a franchisor may be required to disclose under this Act. Section 28. The director shall administer this Act. Section 29. The director may promulgate rules pursuant to chapter 1-26 to carry out the provisions of this Act including forms governing disclosure documents, applications, financial statements, and defining any terms, whether or not used in this Act, if the definitions are not inconsistent with this Act. For the purpose of rules the director may classify franchises, persons and matters within the director's jurisdiction, and prescribe different requirements for different classes. Section 30. The director may, upon request and upon payment of a fee of fifty dollars, respond to requests for interpretive opinions relating to this Act. Section 31. A document is filed when it is received by the director. Section 32. The director shall maintain a record which shows the notice filed franchise and for whom filed, and shall specify the conditions, limitations, and restrictions upon the filing, if any, or shall make proper reference to a formal order of the director on file showing the conditions, limitations, and restrictions. Section 33. Each application, notice and report filed with the director under this Act is open to public inspection in accordance with rules prescribed by the director. The director may publish information filed with the director or obtained by the director, if, in the judgment of the director, such action is in the public interest. No record obtained by the director pursuant to section 35 of this Act is open to public inspection. Section 34. The director shall upon request furnish copies to any person, at a reasonable charge, certified under the director's seal of office if certification is requested, of any notice filing, application and order on file in the director's office. Any copy so certified is admissible in evidence under chapter 19-4. Section 35. The director may make such public or private investigations within or outside of this state as the director deems necessary to determine if any person has violated or is about to violate any rule, order, or provision under this Act or to aid in the enforcement of this Act and in the prescribing of rules and forms under this Act. The director may publish information concerning the violation of any rule, order, or provision under this Act. Section 36. The director may make a written request to any person for information concerning any investigation being conducted by the director. Failure to respond fully and completely to such a request within fifteen days after receipt thereof constitutes cause for the issuance of a cease and desist order. Section 37. For the purpose of any investigation or proceeding under this Act, the director or any person designated by the director may administer oaths and affirmations, subpoena witnesses and compel their attendance, take evidence and require the production of any books, papers, correspondence, memoranda, agreements, or other documents or records which the director deems relevant or material to the inquiry. Any order of the director shall be served by mailing a copy thereof by certified mail to the most recent address of the recipient of the order as it appears in the files of the director. Any subpoena shall be served in the same manner as provided in civil actions in circuit court. No provision of this Act either creates any privilege or derogates from any privilege which exists at common law or otherwise, if documentary or other evidence is sought under a subpoena directed to the director or any of the director's officers or employees. If any person refuses to obey a subpoena, the circuit court, upon application by the director, may issue an order directing the person to appear before the director, or the officer designated by the director, to produce documentary evidence if so ordered, or to give evidence on the matter under investigation or in question. Failure to obey the order of the court is punishable by the court as a contempt of court. Section 38. No person is excused from attending and testifying or from producing any document or record before the director, in obedience to a subpoena of the director or any person designated by the director in any proceeding instituted by the director, on the grounds that the testimony or evidence required of the director may tend to incriminate the person or subject the person to a penalty or forfeiture. No person may be prosecuted or subjected to any penalty or forfeiture on account of any transaction, matter, or thing concerning which the person is compelled, after claiming the privilege against self-incrimination, to testify or produce evidence. However, the person testifying is not exempt from prosecution and punishment for perjury or contempt committed in testifying. Section 39. It is a Class 2 misdemeanor for the director or any of the director's officers or employees to use for personal benefit any information which is filed with or obtained by the director and which is not generally available to the public. Nothing in this Act authorizes the director or any of the director's officers or employees to disclose any confidential information except among themselves or to other administrators or regulatory authorities or if necessary or appropriate in a proceeding or investigation under this Act. Section 40. To encourage uniformity in franchise matters among the federal government, self-regulatory organizations, states and foreign governments, the director may cooperate with federal, state or foreign agencies or administrators and law enforcement agencies, including: (1) Conducting joint examinations and investigations; (2) Holding joint administrative hearings; (3) Filing and prosecuting joint civil or administrative proceedings; (4) Sharing and exchanging information and documents; (5) Sharing and exchanging personnel; (6) Formulating statutes, rules, regulations, statements of policy, guidelines, proposed statutory changes and interpretive opinions and releases; and (7) Issuing and enforcing subpoenas at the request of the Federal Trade Commission or an agency administering franchise statutes in another jurisdiction if the information sought would also be subject to lawful subpoena for conduct occurring in this state. Section 41. The director, with or without prior notice or hearing, may issue a cease and desist order and may issue an order denying, suspending, or revoking any notice filing, amendment, or exemption if the director finds: (1) That the applicant, or franchisor or any officer, director, agent, or employee thereof or any other person has violated or failed to comply with any provision of this Act or any rule or order of the director; (2) That the offer, sale, or purchase of the franchise would constitute misrepresentation to, or deceit or fraud upon, purchasers thereof, or has worked or tended to work a fraud upon purchasers or would so operate; (3) That the applicant, or franchisor or any officer, director, agent, or employee thereof or any other person is engaging or is about to engage in false, fraudulent, or deceptive practices in connection with the offer and sale of a franchise; (4) That any person identified in the disclosure document has been convicted of or had a civil judgment entered against him or her for fraud, theft, fraudulent conversion, restraint of trade, unfair or deceptive practices or misappropriation of property, or is subject to an order issued, after notice and opportunity for hearing, by a state or federal regulatory agency and the involvement of the person in the business of the applicant or franchisor creates a substantial risk to prospective franchisees; (5) That the financial condition of the franchisor adversely affects or would adversely affect the ability of the franchisor to fulfill its obligations under the franchise agreement; or (6) That the franchisor's enterprise or method of business includes or would include activities which are illegal where performed. Section 42. As an alternative to the procedure prescribed in section 41of this Act, the director may issue an order to show cause setting a hearing and requiring an applicant, notice filer, franchisor, or other person to appear and show cause why a cease and desist order should not be issued, or why an order denying, suspending, or revoking a notice filing, amendment, or exemption should not be issued. The order shall give reasonable notice of the time and place for hearing, and shall state the reasons for the entry of the order. The hearing shall be conducted in accordance with chapter 1-26. After the hearing, the director shall enter an order making such disposition of the matter as the facts require. Section 43. The director may impose a civil penalty against a person named in an order issued pursuant to subdivisions (1) to (3), inclusive, and subdivision (6) of section 41of this Act. The amount of the civil penalty may not exceed five thousand dollars for each act or omission that constitutes the basis for issuing the order. The civil penalty may only be imposed: (1) Following an opportunity for a hearing pursuant to section 44 of this Act if the notice delivered to all named persons includes notice of the director's authority to impose a civil penalty under this section; or (2) As part of an order issued pursuant to subdivisions (1) to (3), inclusive and subdivision (6) of section 41 of this Act, if the order is stipulated to by each person subject to the civil penalty. Any civil penalty collected pursuant to this section shall be deposited into the state general fund. Section 44. Upon the entry of an order pursuant to section 41 of this Act without a hearing, the director of the Division of Securities shall promptly serve a copy of the order upon the subject applicant, franchisor, or other person. The order shall state the reasons for its issuance and shall either order a hearing, which shall be set for no later than twenty days from the date of the order, or specify that upon the written request of the applicant, franchisor, or other person, the matter will be set for hearing within fifteen days after receipt of the request. With the consent of the applicant, franchisor, or other person a hearing may be held subsequent to the expiration of either period specified in this section.

In any suit authorized by this section, other relief may be awarded as the court deems appropriate and the court may in its discretion, if the circumstances are sufficiently egregious, increase the award of damages to an amount not to exceed three times the actual damage sustained. Except as explicitly provided in this section, no civil liability in favor of any private party may arise against any person by implication from or as a result of the violation of any provision of this Act or any rule or order thereunder.
