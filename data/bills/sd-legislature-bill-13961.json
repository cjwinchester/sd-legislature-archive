(b) The failure of a limited liability company to observe the usual company formalities or requirements relating to the exercise of its company powers or management of its business is not a ground for imposing personal liability on the members or managers for liabilities of the company.

(b) A limited liability company shall reimburse a member for an advance to the company beyond the amount of contribution the member agreed to make.

SECTION 404A.

(b) In a manager-managed company: (1) Each manager has equal rights in the management and conduct of the company's business; (2) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c), any matter relating to the business of the company may be exclusively decided by the manager or, if there is more than one manager, by a majority of the managers; and (3) A manager: (i) Must be designated, appointed, elected, removed, or replaced by a vote, approval, or consent of a majority of the members; and (ii) Holds office until a successor has been elected and qualified, unless the manager sooner resigns or is removed. (c) The only matters of a member- or manager-managed company's business requiring the consent of all of the members are: (1) The amendment of the operating agreement under section 103; (2) The authorization or ratification of acts or transactions under section 103(b)(2)(ii) which would otherwise violate the duty of loyalty; (3) An amendment to the articles of organization under section 204; (4) The compromise of an obligation to make a contribution under section 402(b); (5) The compromise, as among members, of an obligation of a member to make a contribution or return money or other property paid or distributed in violation of this Act; (6) The making of interim distributions under section 405(a), including the redemption of an interest; (7) The admission of a new member; (8) The use of the company's property to redeem an interest subject to a charging order; (9) The consent to dissolve the company under section 801(2); (10) A waiver of the right to have the company's business wound up and the company terminated under section 802(b); (11) The consent of members to merge with another entity under section 904(c)(1); and (12) The sale, lease, exchange, or other disposal of all, or substantially all, of the company's property with or without goodwill. (d) Action requiring the consent of members or managers under this Act may be taken without a meeting. (e) A member or manager may appoint a proxy to vote or otherwise act for the member or manager by signing an appointment instrument, either personally or by the member's or manager's attorney-in-fact. SECTION 404B. Nothing in this Act prohibits the articles of organization from establishing classes or groups of one or more members having certain expressed relative rights, powers, or duties, including voting rights and the articles of organization may provide for the future creation, in the manner provided in the articles of organization, of additional classes or groups of members having certain relative rights, powers, or duties, including voting rights, expressed either in the regulations or at the time of creation. The rights, powers, or duties of a class or group may be senior to those of one or more existing classes or groups of members. SECTION 405. (a) Any distributions made by a limited liability company before its dissolution and winding up must be in equal shares. (b) A member has no right to receive, and may not be required to accept, a distribution in kind. (c) If a member becomes entitled to receive a distribution, the member has the status of, and is entitled to all remedies available to, a creditor of the limited liability company with respect to the distribution. SECTION 406. (a) A distribution may not be made if: (1) The limited liability company would not be able to pay its debts as they become due in the ordinary course of business; or (2) The company's total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities plus the amount that would be needed, if the company were to be dissolved, wound up, and terminated at the time of the distribution, to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution, winding up, and termination of members whose preferential rights are superior to those receiving the distribution. (b) A limited liability company may base a determination that a distribution is not prohibited under subsection (a) on financial statements prepared on the basis of accounting practices and principles that are reasonable in the circumstances or on a fair valuation or other method that is reasonable in the circumstances. (c) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (e), the effect of a distribution under subsection (a) is measured: (1) In the case of distribution by purchase, redemption, or other acquisition of a distributional interest in a limited liability company, as of the date money or other property is transferred or debt incurred by the company; and (2) In all other cases, as of the date the: (i) Distribution is authorized if the payment occurs within one hundred twenty days after the date of authorization; or (ii) Payment is made if it occurs more than one hundred twenty days after the date of authorization. (d) A limited liability company's indebtedness to a member incurred by reason of a distribution made in accordance with this section is at parity with the company's indebtedness to its general, unsecured creditors. (e) Indebtedness of a limited liability company, including indebtedness issued in connection with or as part of a distribution, is not considered a liability for purposes of determinations under subsection (a) if its terms provide that payment of principal and interest are made only if and to the extent that payment of a distribution to members could then be made under this section. If the indebtedness is issued as a distribution, each payment of principal or interest on the indebtedness is treated as a distribution, the effect of which is measured on the date the payment is made. SECTION 407. (a) Any member of a member-managed company or a member or manager of a manager-managed company who votes for or assents to a distribution made in violation of section 406, the articles of organization, or the operating agreement is personally liable to the company for the amount of the distribution which exceeds the amount that could have been distributed without violating section 406, the articles of organization, or the operating agreement if it is established that the member or manager did not perform the member's or manager's duties in compliance with section 409. (b) A member of a manager-managed company who knew a distribution was made in violation of section 406, the articles of organization, or the operating agreement is personally liable to the company, but only to the extent that the distribution received by the member exceeded the amount that could have been properly paid under section 406. (c) A member or manager against whom an action is brought under this section may implead in the action all: (1) Other members or managers who voted for or assented to the distribution in violation of subsection (a) and may compel contribution from them; and (2) Members who received a distribution in violation of subsection (b) and may compel contribution from the member in the amount received in violation of subsection (b). (d) A proceeding under this section is barred unless it is commenced within two years after the distribution. SECTION 408. (a) A limited liability company shall provide members and their agents and attorneys access for proper purposes to its records, if any, at the company's principal office or other reasonable locations specified in the operating agreement. The company shall provide former members and their agents and attorneys access for proper purposes to records pertaining to the period during which they were members. The right of access provides the opportunity to inspect and copy records during ordinary business hours. The company may impose a reasonable charge, limited to the costs of labor and material, for copies of records furnished. (b) A limited liability company shall furnish to a member, and to the legal representative of a deceased member or member under legal disability: (1) Without demand, information concerning the company's business or affairs reasonably required for the proper exercise of the member's rights and performance of the member's duties under the operating agreement or this Act; and (2) On demand, other information concerning the company's business or affairs, except to the extent the demand or the information demanded is unreasonable or otherwise improper under the circumstances. (c) A member has the right upon written demand given to the limited liability company to obtain at the company's expense a copy of any written operating agreement. SECTION 409. (a) The only fiduciary duties a member owes to a member-managed company and its other members are the duty of loyalty and the duty of care imposed by subsections (b) and (c). (b) A member's duty of loyalty to a member-managed company and its other members is limited to the following: (1) To account to the company and to hold as trustee for it any property, profit, or benefit derived by the member in the conduct or winding up of the company's business or derived from a use by the member of the company's property, including the appropriation of a company's opportunity; (2) To refrain from dealing with the company in the conduct or winding up of the company's business as or on behalf of a party having an interest adverse to the company; and (3) To refrain from competing with the company in the conduct of the company's business before the dissolution of the company. (c) A member's duty of care to a member-managed company and its other members in the conduct of and winding up of the company's business is limited to refraining from engaging in grossly negligent or reckless conduct, intentional misconduct, or a knowing violation of law. (d) A member shall discharge the duties to a member-managed company and its other members under this Act or under the operating agreement and exercise any rights consistently with the obligation of good faith and fair dealing. (e) A member of a member-managed company does not violate a duty or obligation under this Act or under the operating agreement merely because the member's conduct furthers the member's own interest. (f) A member of a member-managed company may lend money to and transact other business with the company. As to each loan or transaction, the rights and obligations of the member are the same as those of a person who is not a member, subject to other applicable law. (g) This section applies to a person winding up the limited liability company's business as the personal or legal representative of the last surviving member as if the person were a member. (h) In a manager-managed company: (1) A member who is not also a manager owes no duties to the company or to the other members solely by reason of being a member; (2) A manager is held to the same standards of conduct prescribed for members in subsections (b) through (f); (3) A member who pursuant to the operating agreement exercises some or all of the rights of a manager in the management and conduct of the company's business is held to the standards of conduct in subsections (b) through (f) to the extent that the member exercises the managerial authority vested in a manager by this Act; and (4) A manager is relieved of liability imposed by law for violation of the standards prescribed by subsections (b) through (f) to the extent of the managerial authority delegated to the members by the operating agreement. SECTION 410. (a) A member may maintain an action against a limited liability company or another member for legal or equitable relief, with or without an accounting as to the company's business, to enforce: (1) The member's rights under the operating agreement; (2) The member's rights under this Act; and (3) The rights and otherwise protect the interests of the member, including rights and interests arising independently of the member's relationship to the company. (b) The accrual, and any time limited for the assertion, of a right of action for a remedy under this section is governed by other law. A right to an accounting upon a dissolution and winding up does not revive a claim barred by law. SECTION 501. (a) A member is not a co-owner of, and has no transferable interest in, property of a limited liability company. (b) A distributional interest in a limited liability company is personal property and, subject to sections 502 and 503, may be transferred in whole or in part. (c) An operating agreement may provide that a distributional interest may be evidenced by a certificate of the interest issued by the limited liability company and, subject to section 503, may also provide for the transfer of any interest represented by the certificate. SECTION 502. A transfer of a distributional interest does not entitle the transferee to become or to exercise any rights of a member. A transfer entitles the transferee to receive, to the extent transferred, only the distributions to which the transferor would be entitled. SECTION 503. (a) A transferee of a distributional interest may become a member of a limited liability company if and to the extent that the transferor gives the transferee the right in accordance with authority described in the operating agreement or all other members consent. (b) A transferee who has become a member, to the extent transferred, has the rights and powers, and is subject to the restrictions and liabilities, of a member under the operating agreement of a limited liability company and this Act. A transferee who becomes a member also is liable for the transferor member's obligations to make contributions under section 402 and for obligations under section 407 to return unlawful distributions, but the transferee is not obligated for the transferor member's liabilities unknown to the transferee at the time the transferee becomes a member. (c) Whether or not a transferee of a distributional interest becomes a member under subsection (a), the transferor is not released from liability to the limited liability company under the operating agreement or this Act. (d) A transferee who does not become a member is not entitled to participate in the management or conduct of the limited liability company's business, require access to information concerning the company's transactions, or inspect or copy any of the company's records. (e) A transferee who does not become a member is entitled to: (1) Receive, in accordance with the transfer, distributions to which the transferor would otherwise be entitled; (2) Receive, upon dissolution and winding up of the limited liability company's business: (i) In accordance with the transfer, the net amount otherwise distributable to the transferor; (ii) A statement of account only from the date of the latest statement of account agreed to by all the members; (3) Seek under section 801(a)(5) a judicial determination that it is equitable to dissolve and wind up the company's business. (f) A limited liability company need not give effect to a transfer until it has notice of the transfer. SECTION 504. (a) On application by a judgment creditor of a member of a limited liability company or of a member's transferee, a court having jurisdiction may charge the distributional interest of the judgment debtor to satisfy the judgment. The court may appoint a receiver of the share of the distributions due or to become due to the judgment debtor and make all other orders, directions, accounts, and inquiries the judgment debtor might have made or which the circumstances may require to give effect to the charging order. (b) A charging order constitutes a lien on the judgment debtor's distributional interest. The court may order a foreclosure of a lien on a distributional interest subject to the charging order at any time. A purchaser at the foreclosure sale has the rights of a transferee. (c) At any time before foreclosure, a distributional interest in a limited liability company which is charged may be redeemed: (1) By the judgment debtor; (2) With property other than the company's property, by one or more of the other members; or (3) With the company's property, but only if permitted by the operating agreement. (d) This Act does not affect a member's right under exemption laws with respect to the member's distributional interest in a limited liability company. (e) This section provides the exclusive remedy by which a judgment creditor of a member or a transferee may satisfy a judgment out of the judgment debtor's distributional interest in a limited liability company. SECTION 601. A member is dissociated from a limited liability company upon the occurrence of any of the following events: (1) The company's having notice of the member's express will to withdraw upon the date of notice or on a later date specified by the member; (2) An event agreed to in the operating agreement as causing the member's dissociation; (3) Upon transfer of all of a member's distributional interest, other than a transfer for security purposes or a court order charging the member's distributional interest which has not been foreclosed; (4) The member's expulsion pursuant to the operating agreement; (5) The member's expulsion by unanimous vote of the other members if: (i) It is unlawful to carry on the company's business with the member; (ii) There has been a transfer of substantially all of the member's distributional interest, other than a transfer for security purposes or a court order charging the member's distributional interest which has not been foreclosed; (iii) Within ninety days after the company notifies a corporate member that it will be expelled because it has filed a certificate of dissolution or the equivalent, its charter has been revoked, or its right to conduct business has been suspended by the jurisdiction of its incorporation, the member fails to obtain a revocation of the certificate of dissolution or a reinstatement of its charter or its right to conduct business; or (iv) A partnership or a limited liability company that is a member has been dissolved and its business is being wound up; (6) On application by the company or another member, the member's expulsion by judicial determination because the member: (i) Engaged in wrongful conduct that adversely and materially affected the company's business; (ii) Willfully or persistently committed a material breach of the operating agreement or of a duty owed to the company or the other members under section 409; or (iii) Engaged in conduct relating to the company's business which makes it not reasonably practicable to carry on the business with the member; (7) The member's: (i) Becoming a debtor in bankruptcy; (ii) Executing an assignment for the benefit of creditors; (iii) Seeking, consenting to, or acquiescing in the appointment of a trustee, receiver, or liquidator of the member or of all or substantially all of the member's property; or (iv) Failing, within ninety days after the appointment, to have vacated or stayed the appointment of a trustee, receiver, or liquidator of the member or of all or substantially all of the member's property obtained without the member's consent or acquiescence, or failing within ninety days after the expiration of a stay to have the appointment vacated; (8) In the case of a member who is an individual: (i) The member's death; (ii) The appointment of a guardian or general conservator for the member; or (iii) A judicial determination that the member has otherwise become incapable of performing the member's duties under the operating agreement; (9) In the case of a member that is a trust or is acting as a member by virtue of being a trustee of a trust, distribution of the trust's entire rights to receive distributions from the company, but not merely by reason of the substitution of a successor trustee; (10) In the case of a member that is an estate or is acting as a member by virtue of being a personal representative of an estate, distribution of the estate's entire rights to receive distributions from the company, but not merely the substitution of a successor personal representative; or (11) Termination of the existence of a member if the member is not an individual, estate, or trust other than a business trust. SECTION 602. (a) Unless otherwise provided in the operating agreement, a member has the power to dissociate from a limited liability company at any time, rightfully or wrongfully, by express will pursuant to section 601(1). (b) If the operating agreement has not eliminated a member's power to dissociate, the member's dissociation from a limited liability company is wrongful only if: (1) It is in breach of an express provision of the agreement; or (2) Before the expiration of the term specified in the articles of organization if any: (i) The member withdraws by express will; (ii) The member is expelled by judicial determination under section 601(6); (iii) The member is dissociated by becoming a debtor in bankruptcy; or (iv) In the case of a member who is not an individual, trust other than a business trust, or estate, the member is expelled or otherwise dissociated because it willfully dissolved or terminated its existence. (c) A member who wrongfully dissociates from a limited liability company is liable to the company and to the other members for damages caused by the dissociation. The liability is in addition to any other obligation of the member to the company or to the other members. SECTION 603. (a) A limited liability company does not dissolve and wind up its business as result of a member's dissociation. (b) Upon a member's dissociation from a limited liability company: (1) The member's right to participate in the management and conduct of the company's business terminates, except as otherwise provided in section 803, and the member ceases to be a member and is treated the same as a transferee of a member; (2) The member's duty of loyalty under section 409(b)(3) terminates; and (3) The member's duty of loyalty under section 409(b)(1) and (2) and duty of care under section 409(c) continue only with regard to matters arising and events occurring before the member's dissociation. SECTION 604. For two years after a member dissociates without the dissociation resulting in a dissolution and winding up of a limited liability company's business, the company, including a surviving company under Article 9, is bound by an act of the dissociated member which would have bound the company under section 301 before dissociation only if at the time of entering into the transaction the other party: (1) Reasonably believed that the dissociated member was then a member; (2) Did not have notice of the member's dissociation; and (3) Is not deemed to have had notice under section 605. SECTION 605. (a) A dissociated member or a limited liability company may file in the office of the secretary of state a statement of dissociation stating the name of the company and that the member is dissociated from the company. If the statement is filed by a dissociated member a copy of the statement must also be delivered to the company by the dissociated member. (b) For the purposes of sections 301 and 604, a person not a member is deemed to have notice of the dissociation ninety days after the statement of dissociation is filed. SECTION 801. (a) A limited liability company is dissolved, and its business must be wound up, upon the occurrence of any of the following events: (1) An event specified in the operating agreement; (2) Consent of the number or percentage of members specified in the operating agreement; (3) An event that makes it unlawful for all or substantially all of the business of the company to be continued, but any cure of illegality within ninety days after notice to the company of the event is effective retroactively to the date of the event for purposes of this section; (4) On application by a member or a dissociated member, upon entry of a judicial decree that: (i) The economic purpose of the company is likely to be unreasonably frustrated; (ii) Another member has engaged in conduct relating to the company's business that makes it not reasonably practicable to carry on the company's business with that member; (iii) It is not otherwise reasonably practicable to carry on the company's business in conformity with the articles of organization and the operating agreement; or (iv) The managers or members in control of the company have acted, are acting, or will act in a manner that is illegal, oppressive, fraudulent, or unfairly prejudicial to the petitioner; or (5) On application by a transferee of a member's interest, a judicial determination that it is equitable to wind up the company's business after the expiration of a specified duration or event, if the company was for a specified duration at the time the applicant became a transferee by member dissociation, transfer, or entry of a charging order that gave rise to the transfer. SECTION 802. (a) Subject to subsection (b), a limited liability company continues after dissolution only for the purpose of winding up its business. (b) At any time after the dissolution of a limited liability company and before the winding up of its business is completed, the members may unanimously waive the right to have the company's business wound up and the company terminated. In that case: (1) The limited liability company resumes carrying on its business as if dissolution had never occurred and any liability incurred by the company or a member after the dissolution and before the waiver is determined as if the dissolution had never occurred; and (2) The rights of a third party accruing as a result of the dissolution, under section 804(a), or arising out of conduct in reliance on the dissolution before the third party knew or received a notification of the waiver are not adversely affected. SECTION 803. (a) After dissolution, a member who has not wrongfully dissociated may participate in winding up a limited liability company's business, but on application of any member, member's legal representative, or transferee, the circuit court, for good cause shown, may order judicial supervision of the winding up. (b) A legal representative of the last surviving member may wind up a limited liability company's business. (c) A person winding up a limited liability company's business may preserve the company's business or property as a going concern for a reasonable time, prosecute and defend actions and proceedings, whether civil, criminal, or administrative, settle and close the company's business, dispose of and transfer the company's property, discharge the company's liabilities, distribute the assets of the company pursuant to section 806, settle disputes by mediation or arbitration, and perform other necessary acts. SECTION 804. (a) A limited liability company is bound by a member's or manager's act after dissolution that: (1) Is appropriate for winding up the company's business; or (2) Would have bound the company under section 301 before dissolution, if the other party to the transaction did not have notice of the dissolution. (b) A member or manager who, with knowledge of the dissolution, subjects a limited liability company to liability by an act that is not appropriate for winding up the company's business is liable to the company for any damage caused to the company arising from the liability. SECTION 805. (a) At any time after dissolution and winding up, a limited liability company may terminate its existence by filing with the secretary of state articles of termination stating: (1) The name of the company; (2) The date of the dissolution; and (3) That the company's business has been wound up and the legal existence of the company has been terminated. (b) The existence of a limited liability company is terminated upon the filing of the articles of termination, or upon a later effective date, if specified in the articles of termination. SECTION 806. (a) In winding up a limited liability company's business, the assets of the company must be applied to discharge its obligations to creditors, including members who are creditors. Any surplus must be applied to pay in money the net amount distributable to members in accordance with their right to distributions under subsection (b).

SECTION 807. (a) A dissolved limited liability company may dispose of the known claims against it by following the procedure described in this section. (b) A dissolved limited liability company shall notify its known claimants in writing of the dissolution. The notice must: (1) Specify the information required to be included in a claim; (2) Provide a mailing address where the claim is to be sent; (3) State the deadline for receipt of the claim, which may not be less than one hundred twenty days after the date the written notice is received by the claimant; and (4) State that the claim will be barred if not received by the deadline. (c) A claim against a dissolved limited liability company is barred if the requirements of subsection (b) are met, and: (1) The claim is not received by the specified deadline; or (2) In the case of a claim that is timely received but rejected by the dissolved company, the claimant does not commence a proceeding to enforce the claim within ninety days after the receipt of the notice of the rejection. (d) For purposes of this section, claim does not include a contingent liability or a claim based on an event occurring after the effective date of dissolution. SECTION 808. (a) A dissolved limited liability company may publish notice of its dissolution and request persons having claims against the company to present them in accordance with the notice. (b) The notice must: (1) Be published at least once in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the dissolved limited liability company's principal office is located or, if none in this State, in which its designated office is or was last located; (2) Describe the information required to be contained in a claim and provide a mailing address where the claim is to be sent; and (3) State that a claim against the limited liability company is barred unless a proceeding to enforce the claim is commenced within five years after publication of the notice.

SECTION 809. The secretary of state may commence a proceeding to dissolve a limited liability company administratively if the company does not: (1) Pay any fees, taxes, or penalties imposed by this Act or other law within sixty days after they are due; or (2) Deliver its annual report to the secretary of state within sixty days after it is due. SECTION 810. (a) If the secretary of state determines that a ground exists for administratively dissolving a limited liability company, the secretary of state shall enter a record of the determination and serve the company with a copy of the record. (b) If the company does not correct each ground for dissolution or demonstrate to the reasonable satisfaction of the secretary of state that each ground determined by the secretary of state does not exist within sixty days after service of the notice, the secretary of state shall administratively dissolve the company by signing a certification of the dissolution that recites the ground for dissolution and its effective date. The secretary of state shall file the original of the certificate and serve the company with a copy of the certificate. (c) A company administratively dissolved continues its existence but may carry on only business necessary to wind up and liquidate its business and affairs under section 802 and to notify claimants under sections 807 and 808. (d) The administrative dissolution of a company does not terminate the authority of its agent for service of process. SECTION 811.

The application must: (1) Recite the name of the company and the effective date of its administrative dissolution; (2) State that the ground for dissolution either did not exist or have been eliminated; (3) State that the company's name satisfies the requirements of section 105; and (4) Contain a certificate from the appropriate state authority reciting that all taxes owed by the company have been paid.

(c) When reinstatement is effective, it relates back to and takes effect as of the effective date of the administrative dissolution and the company may resume its business as if the administrative dissolution had never occurred. SECTION 812. (a) If the secretary of state denies a limited liability company's application for reinstatement following administrative dissolution, the secretary of state shall serve the company with a record that explains the reason or reasons for denial. (b) The company may appeal the denial of reinstatement to the state circuit court within thirty days after service of the notice of denial is perfected. The company appeals by petitioning the court to set aside the dissolution and attaching to the petition copies of the secretary of state's certificate of dissolution, the company's application for reinstatement, and the secretary of state's notice of denial. (c) The court may summarily order the secretary of state to reinstate the dissolved company or may take other action the court considers appropriate.

SECTION 1005. (a) If the name of a foreign limited liability company does not satisfy the requirements of section 105, the company, to obtain or maintain a certificate of authority to transact business in this state, must use a fictitious name to transact business in this state if its real name is unavailable and it delivers to the secretary of state for filing a copy of the resolution of its managers, in the case of a manager-managed company, or of its members, in the case of a member-managed company, adopting the fictitious name.

(b) Unless its articles of organization provide otherwise, a limited liability company has the same powers as an individual to do all things necessary or convenient to carry on its business or affairs, including power to: (1) Sue and be sued, and defend in its name; (2) Purchase, receive, lease, or otherwise acquire, and own, hold, improve, use, and otherwise deal with real or personal property, or any legal or equitable interest in property, wherever located; (3) Sell, convey, mortgage, grant a security interest in, lease, exchange, and otherwise encumber or dispose of all or any part of its property; (4) Purchase, receive, subscribe for, or otherwise acquire, own, hold, vote, use, sell, mortgage, lend, grant a security interest in, or otherwise dispose of and deal in and with, shares or other interests in or obligations of any other entity; (5) Make contracts and guarantees, incur liabilities, borrow money, issue its notes, bonds, and other obligations, which may be convertible into or include the option to purchase other securities of the limited liability company, and secure any of its obligations by a mortgage on or a security interest in any of its property, franchises, or income; (6) Lend money, invest and reinvest its funds, and receive and hold real and personal property as security for repayment; (7) Be a promoter, partner, member, associate, or manager of any partnership, joint venture, trust, or other entity including but not limited to limited partnerships and limited liability companies; (8) Conduct its business, locate offices, and exercise the powers granted by this Act within or without this state; (9) Elect managers and appoint officers, employees, and agents of the limited liability company, define their duties, fix their compensation, and lend them money and credit, or otherwise assist its members; (10) Pay pensions and establish pension plans, pension trusts, profit sharing plans, bonus plans, option plans, and benefit or incentive plans for any or all of its current or former members, managers, officers, employees, and agents; (11) Make donations for the public welfare or for charitable, scientific, or educational purposes; and (12) Make payments or donations, or do any other act, not inconsistent with law, that furthers the business of the limited liability company. SECTION 201. A limited liability company is a legal entity distinct from its members. A member of a limited liability company is not a proper party to proceedings by or against a limited liability company. SECTION 202A. (a) One or more persons may organize a limited liability company, consisting of one or more members, by delivering articles of organization to the Office of the Secretary of State for filing. (b) Unless a delayed effective date is specified in accordance with section 206(d), the existence of a limited liability company begins when the articles of organization and the first annual report as required in section 211(c) are filed. (c) The original and one exact or conforming copy of the articles of organization and the first annual report shall be delivered to the secretary of state. If the secretary of state finds that the articles of organization and the annual report conform to law, the secretary of state shall, when all fees have been paid as prescribed: (1) Endorse both the original and the exact or conforming copy with the word, Filed, and the month, date, and year of the filing; (2) File the original; (3) Issue a certificate of organization and affix to the certificate, the exact or conforming copy. The certificate of organization, together with the exact or conforming copy of the articles of organization affixed to it by the secretary of state, shall be returned to the principal office of the limited liability company or to its representative. SECTION 202B. Upon the issuance of the certificate of organization, the limited liability company shall be considered organized, and such certificate of organization shall be conclusive evidence that all conditions precedent required to be performed by the members have been complied with and that the limited liability company has been legally organized under this Act, except as against this state in a proceeding to cancel or revoke the certificate of organization or for involuntary dissolution of the limited liability company. No limited liability company may transact business or incur indebtedness, except that which is incidental to its organization, or except for obtaining subscriptions for or payment of contributions, until the secretary of state has issued a certificate of organization. SECTION 203. (a) Articles of organization of a limited liability company must set forth: (1) The name of the company; (2) The address of the initial designated office; (3) The name and street address of the initial agent for service of process; (4) The name and address of each organizer; (5) The duration of the company if other than perpetual; (6) Whether the company is to be manager-managed, and, if so, the name and address for each initial manager; and (7) Whether one or more of the members of the company are to be liable for its debts and obligations under section 303(c). (b) Articles of organization of a limited liability company may set forth: (1) Provisions permitted to be set forth in an operating agreement; or (2) Other matters not inconsistent with law. (c) Articles of organization of a limited liability company may not vary the nonwaivable provisions of section 103(b). As to all other matters, if any provision of an operating agreement is inconsistent with the articles of organization: (1) The operating agreement controls as to managers, members, and members' transferees; and (2) The articles of organization control as to persons, other than managers, members and their transferees, who reasonably rely on the articles to their detriment. SECTION 204. (a) Articles of organization of a limited liability company may be amended at any time by delivering articles of amendment to the secretary of state for filing. The articles of amendment must set forth the: (1) Name of the limited liability company; (2) Date of filing of the articles of organization; and (3) Amendment to the articles. (b) A limited liability company may restate its articles of organization at any time. Restated articles of organization must be signed and filed in the same manner as articles of amendment. Restated articles of organization must be designated as such in the heading and state in the heading or in an introductory paragraph the limited liability company's present name and, if it has been changed, all of its former names and the date of the filing of its initial articles of organization. SECTION 205. (a) Except as otherwise provided in this Act a record to be filed by or on behalf of a limited liability company in the Office of the Secretary of State must be signed in the name of the company by a: (1) Manager of a manager-managed company; (2) Member of a member-managed company; (3) Person organizing the company, if the company has not been formed; or (4) Fiduciary, if the company is in the hands of a receiver, trustee, or other court- appointed fiduciary. (b) A record signed under subsection (a) must state adjacent to the signature the name and capacity of the signer. (c) Any person may sign a record to be filed under subsection (a) by an attorney-in-fact. Powers of attorney relating to the signing of records to be filed under subsection (a) by an attorney-in-fact need not be filed in the Office of the Secretary of State as evidence of authority by the person filing but must be retained by the company. SECTION 206. (a) Articles of organization or any other record authorized to be filed under this Act must be in a medium permitted by the secretary of state and must be delivered to the Office of the Secretary of State. Unless the secretary of state determines that a record fails to comply as to form with the filing requirements of this Act, and if all filing fees have been paid, the secretary of state shall file the record and send a receipt for the record and the fees to the limited liability company or its representative. (b) Upon request and payment of a fee, the secretary of state shall send to the requester a certified copy of the requested record. (c) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (d), sections 202A and 202B, and subsection 207(c), a record accepted for filing by the secretary of state is effective: (1) At the time of filing on the date it is filed, as evidenced by the secretary of state's date and time endorsement on the original record; or (2) At the time specified in the record as its effective time on the date it is filed. (d) A record, including the articles of organization, may specify a delayed effective time and date, and if it does so the record becomes effective at the time and date specified subject to the other requirements of this Act. If a delayed effective date but no time is specified, the record is effective at the close of business on that date. If a delayed effective date is later than the ninetieth day after the record is filed, the record is effective on the ninetieth day. SECTION 207. (a) A limited liability company or foreign limited liability company may correct a record filed by the secretary of state if the record contains a false or erroneous statement or was defectively signed. (b) A record is corrected: (1) By preparing articles of correction that: (i) Describe the record, including its filing date, or attach a copy of it to the articles of correction; (ii) Specify the incorrect statement and the reason it is incorrect or the manner in which the signing was defective; and (iii) Correct the incorrect statement or defective signing; and (2) By delivering the corrected record to the secretary of state for filing. (c) Articles of correction are effective retroactively on the effective date of the record they correct except as to persons relying on the uncorrected record and adversely affected by the correction. As to those persons, articles of correction are effective when filed. SECTION 208. (a) Any person may request the secretary of state to furnish a certificate of existence for a limited liability company or a certificate of authorization for a foreign limited liability company. (b) A certificate of existence for a limited liability company must set forth: (1) The company's name; (2) That it is duly organized under the laws of this state, the date of organization, whether its duration is at-will or for a specified term, and, if the latter, the period specified; (3) If payment is reflected in the records of the secretary of state and if nonpayment affects the existence of the company, that all fees, taxes, and penalties owed to this state have been paid; (4) Whether its most recent annual report required by section 211 has been filed with the secretary of state; (5) That articles of termination have not been filed; and (6) Other facts of record in the Office of the Secretary of State which may be requested by the applicant. (c) A certificate of authorization for a foreign limited liability company must set forth: (1) The company's name used in this state; (2) That it is authorized to transact business in this state; (3) If payment is reflected in the records of the secretary of state and if nonpayment affects the authorization of the company, that all fees, taxes, and penalties owed to this state have been paid; (4) Whether its most recent annual report required by section 211 has been filed with the secretary of state; (5) That a certificate of cancellation has not been filed; and (6) Other facts of record in the Office of the Secretary of State which may be requested by the applicant. (d) Subject to any qualification stated in the certificate, a certificate of existence or authorization issued by the secretary of state may be relied upon as conclusive evidence that the domestic or foreign limited liability company is in existence or is authorized to transact business in this state. SECTION 210. If a person required by section 205 to sign any record fails or refuses to do so, any other person who is adversely affected by the failure or refusal may petition the state circuit court to direct the signing of the record. If the court finds that it is proper for the record to be signed and that a person so designated has failed or refused to sign the record, it shall order the secretary of state to sign and file an appropriate record. SECTION 211. (a) A limited liability company, and a foreign limited liability company authorized to transact business in this state, shall deliver to the secretary of state for filing an annual report that sets forth: (1) The name of the company and the state or country under whose law it is organized; (2) The address of its registered office and the name and address of its registered agent for service of process in this state; (3) The address of its principal office; (4) The names and business addresses of any managers; (5) The dollar amount of the total agreed contributions to the limited liability company. (b) Information in an annual report must be current as of the date the annual report is signed on behalf of the limited liability company. (c) The first annual report must be delivered to the secretary of state concurrent with the filing of the articles of organization. Subsequent annual reports must be delivered to the secretary of state before the first day of the second month following the anniversary month of the filing date. (d) If an annual report does not contain the information required in subsection (a) or the fees required by section 212, the secretary of state shall promptly notify the reporting limited liability company or foreign limited liability company and return the report to it for correction. If the report is corrected to contain the information required in subsection (a) or the fees required by section 212 and delivered to the secretary of state within thirty days after the effective date of the notice, it is timely filed. SECTION 212. The secretary of state shall charge and collect for: (a) Filing the first annual report if the total agreed contribution of the limited liability company are: Agreed Contribution Fee Not in excess of $50,000 $ 90 $50,001, to $100,000 $150 In excess of $100,000 $150 for first $100,000, plus $.50 for each additional $1,000 The maximum amount charged under this subsection together with any subsequent payments under subsection (b) may not exceed sixteen thousand dollars. (b) Filing any subsequent annual report that reflects additional contribution in excess of those stated in the last prior report, any additional fee necessary to make the cumulative fee match the cumulative agreed contributions as provided in subsection (a); above the agreed contributions as set forth in the last previous annual report consistent with subsection (a). (c) A reporting fee of fifty dollars, due and payable with the filing of all annual report, after the first annual report required in section 211(c). SECTION 301. (a) Subject to subsections (b) and (c): (1) Each member is an agent of the limited liability company for the purpose of its business, and an act of a member, including the signing of an instrument in the company's name, for apparently carrying on in the ordinary course the company's business or business of the kind carried on by the company binds the company, unless the member had no authority to act for the company in the particular matter and the person with whom the member was dealing knew or had notice that the member lacked authority. (2) An act of a member which is not apparently for carrying on in the ordinary course the company's business or business of the kind carried on by the company binds the company only if the act was authorized by the other members. (b) Subject to subsection (c), in a manager-managed company: (1) A member is not an agent of the company for the purpose of its business solely by reason of being a member. Each manager is an agent of the company for the purpose of its business, and an act of a manager, including the signing of an instrument in the company's name, for apparently carrying on in the ordinary course the company's business or business of the kind carried on by the company binds the company, unless the manager had no authority to act for the company in the particular matter and the person with whom the manager was dealing knew or had notice that the manager lacked authority. (2) An act of a manager which is not apparently for carrying on in the ordinary course the company's business or business of the kind carried on by the company binds the company only if the act was authorized under section 404A. (c) Unless the articles of organization limit their authority, any member of a member- managed company or manager of a manager-managed company may sign and deliver any instrument transferring or affecting the company's interest in real property. The instrument is conclusive in favor of a person who gives value without knowledge of the lack of the authority of the person signing and delivering the instrument. SECTION 302. A limited liability company is liable for loss or injury caused to a person, or for a penalty incurred, as a result of a wrongful act or omission, or other actionable conduct, of a member or manager acting in the ordinary course of business of the company or with authority of the company. SECTION 303. (a) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c), the debts, obligations, and liabilities of a limited liability company, whether arising in contract, tort, or otherwise, are solely the debts, obligations, and liabilities of the company. A member or manager is not personally liable for a debt, obligation, or liability of the company solely by reason of being or acting as a member or manager. (b) The failure of a limited liability company to observe the usual company formalities or requirements relating to the exercise of its company powers or management of its business is not a ground for imposing personal liability on the members or managers for liabilities of the company. (c) All or specified members of a limited liability company are liable in their capacity as members for all or specified debts, obligations, or liabilities of the company if: (1) A provision to that effect is contained in the articles of organization; and (2) A member so liable has consented in writing to the adoption of the provision or to be bound by the provision. SECTION 401. A contribution of a member of a limited liability company may consist of tangible or intangible property or other benefit to the company, including money, promissory notes, services performed, or other agreements to contribute cash or property, or contracts for services to be performed. SECTION 402. (a) A member's obligation to contribute money, property, or other benefit to, or to perform services for, a limited liability company is not excused by the member's death, disability, or other inability to perform personally. If a member does not make the required contribution of property or services, the member is obligated at the option of the company to contribute money equal to the value of that portion of the stated contribution which has not been made. (b) A creditor of a limited liability company who extends credit or otherwise acts in reliance on an obligation described in subsection (a), and without notice of any compromise under section 404A(c)(5), may enforce the original obligation. SECTION 403. (a) A limited liability company shall reimburse a member or manager for payments made and indemnify a member or manager for liabilities incurred by the member or manager in the ordinary course of the business of the company or for the preservation of its business or property. (b) A limited liability company shall reimburse a member for an advance to the company beyond the amount of contribution the member agreed to make. (c) A payment or advance made by a member which gives rise to an obligation of a limited liability company under subsection (a) or (b) constitutes a loan to the company upon which interest accrues from the date of the payment or advance. (d) A member is not entitled to remuneration for services performed for a limited liability company, except for reasonable compensation for services rendered in winding up the business of the company. SECTION 404A. (a) In a member-managed company: (1) Each member has equal rights in the management and conduct of the company's business; and (2) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c), any matter relating to the business of the company may be decided by a majority of the members. (b) In a manager-managed company: (1) Each manager has equal rights in the management and conduct of the company's business; (2) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c), any matter relating to the business of the company may be exclusively decided by the manager or, if there is more than one manager, by a majority of the managers; and (3) A manager: (i) Must be designated, appointed, elected, removed, or replaced by a vote, approval, or consent of a majority of the members; and (ii) Holds office until a successor has been elected and qualified, unless the manager sooner resigns or is removed. (c) The only matters of a member- or manager-managed company's business requiring the consent of all of the members are: (1) The amendment of the operating agreement under section 103; (2) The authorization or ratification of acts or transactions under section 103(b)(2)(ii) which would otherwise violate the duty of loyalty; (3) An amendment to the articles of organization under section 204; (4) The compromise of an obligation to make a contribution under section 402(b); (5) The compromise, as among members, of an obligation of a member to make a contribution or return money or other property paid or distributed in violation of this Act; (6) The making of interim distributions under section 405(a), including the redemption of an interest; (7) The admission of a new member; (8) The use of the company's property to redeem an interest subject to a charging order; (9) The consent to dissolve the company under section 801(a)(2); (10) A waiver of the right to have the company's business wound up and the company terminated under section 802(b); (11) The consent of members to merge with another entity under section 904(c)(1); and (12) The sale, lease, exchange, or other disposal of all, or substantially all, of the company's property with or without goodwill. (d) Action requiring the consent of members or managers under this Act may be taken without a meeting. (e) A member or manager may appoint a proxy to vote or otherwise act for the member or manager by signing an appointment instrument, either personally or by the member's or manager's attorney-in-fact. SECTION 404B. Nothing in this Act prohibits the articles of organization from establishing classes or groups of one or more members having certain expressed relative rights, powers, or duties, including voting rights and the articles of organization may provide for the future creation, in the manner provided in the articles of organization, of additional classes or groups of members having certain relative rights, powers, or duties, including voting rights, expressed either in the regulations or at the time of creation. The rights, powers, or duties of a class or group may be senior to those of one or more existing classes or groups of members. SECTION 405. (a) Any distributions made by a limited liability company before its dissolution and winding up must be in equal shares. (b) A member has no right to receive, and may not be required to accept, a distribution in kind. (c) If a member becomes entitled to receive a distribution, the member has the status of, and is entitled to all remedies available to, a creditor of the limited liability company with respect to the distribution. SECTION 406. (a) A distribution may not be made if: (1) The limited liability company would not be able to pay its debts as they become due in the ordinary course of business; or (2) The company's total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities plus the amount that would be needed, if the company were to be dissolved, wound up, and terminated at the time of the distribution, to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution, winding up, and termination of members whose preferential rights are superior to those receiving the distribution. (b) A limited liability company may base a determination that a distribution is not prohibited under subsection (a) on financial statements prepared on the basis of accounting practices and principles that are reasonable in the circumstances or on a fair valuation or other method that is reasonable in the circumstances. (c) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (e), the effect of a distribution under subsection (a) is measured: (1) In the case of distribution by purchase, redemption, or other acquisition of a distributional interest in a limited liability company, as of the date money or other property is transferred or debt incurred by the company; and (2) In all other cases, as of the date the: (i) Distribution is authorized if the payment occurs within one hundred twenty days after the date of authorization; or (ii) Payment is made if it occurs more than one hundred twenty days after the date of authorization. (d) A limited liability company's indebtedness to a member incurred by reason of a distribution made in accordance with this section is at parity with the company's indebtedness to its general, unsecured creditors. (e) Indebtedness of a limited liability company, including indebtedness issued in connection with or as part of a distribution, is not considered a liability for purposes of determinations under subsection (a) if its terms provide that payment of principal and interest are made only if and to the extent that payment of a distribution to members could then be made under this section. If the indebtedness is issued as a distribution, each payment of principal or interest on the indebtedness is treated as a distribution, the effect of which is measured on the date the payment is made. SECTION 407. (a) Any member of a member-managed company or a member or manager of a manager-managed company who votes for or assents to a distribution made in violation of section 406, the articles of organization, or the operating agreement is personally liable to the company for the amount of the distribution which exceeds the amount that could have been distributed without violating section 406, the articles of organization, or the operating agreement if it is established that the member or manager did not perform the member's or manager's duties in compliance with section 409. (b) A member of a manager-managed company who knew a distribution was made in violation of section 406, the articles of organization, or the operating agreement is personally liable to the company, but only to the extent that the distribution received by the member exceeded the amount that could have been properly paid under section 406. (c) A member or manager against whom an action is brought under this section may implead in the action all: (1) Other members or managers who voted for or assented to the distribution in violation of subsection (a) and may compel contribution from them; and (2) Members who received a distribution in violation of subsection (b) and may compel contribution from the member in the amount received in violation of subsection (b). (d) A proceeding under this section is barred unless it is commenced within two years after the distribution. SECTION 408. (a) A limited liability company shall provide members and their agents and attorneys access for proper purposes to its records, if any, at the company's principal office or other reasonable locations specified in the operating agreement. The company shall provide former members and their agents and attorneys access for proper purposes to records pertaining to the period during which they were members. The right of access provides the opportunity to inspect and copy records during ordinary business hours. The company may impose a reasonable charge, limited to the costs of labor and material, for copies of records furnished. (b) A limited liability company shall furnish to a member, and to the legal representative of a deceased member or member under legal disability: (1) Without demand, information concerning the company's business or affairs reasonably required for the proper exercise of the member's rights and performance of the member's duties under the operating agreement or this Act; and (2) On demand, other information concerning the company's business or affairs, except to the extent the demand or the information demanded is unreasonable or otherwise improper under the circumstances. (c) A member has the right upon written demand given to the limited liability company to obtain at the company's expense a copy of any written operating agreement. SECTION 409. (a) The only fiduciary duties a member owes to a member-managed company and its other members are the duty of loyalty and the duty of care imposed by subsections (b) and (c). (b) A member's duty of loyalty to a member-managed company and its other members is limited to the following: (1) To account to the company and to hold as trustee for it any property, profit, or benefit derived by the member in the conduct or winding up of the company's business or derived from a use by the member of the company's property, including the appropriation of a company's opportunity; (2) To refrain from dealing with the company in the conduct or winding up of the company's business as or on behalf of a party having an interest adverse to the company; and (3) To refrain from competing with the company in the conduct of the company's business before the dissolution of the company. (c) A member's duty of care to a member-managed company and its other members in the conduct of and winding up of the company's business is limited to refraining from engaging in grossly negligent or reckless conduct, intentional misconduct, or a knowing violation of law. (d) A member shall discharge the duties to a member-managed company and its other members under this Act or under the operating agreement and exercise any rights consistently with the obligation of good faith and fair dealing. (e) A member of a member-managed company does not violate a duty or obligation under this Act or under the operating agreement merely because the member's conduct furthers the member's own interest. (f) A member of a member-managed company may lend money to and transact other business with the company. As to each loan or transaction, the rights and obligations of the member are the same as those of a person who is not a member, subject to other applicable law. (g) This section applies to a person winding up the limited liability company's business as the personal or legal representative of the last surviving member as if the person were a member. (h) In a manager-managed company: (1) A member who is not also a manager owes no duties to the company or to the other members solely by reason of being a member; (2) A manager is held to the same standards of conduct prescribed for members in subsections (b) through (f); (3) A member who pursuant to the operating agreement exercises some or all of the rights of a manager in the management and conduct of the company's business is held to the standards of conduct in subsections (b) through (f) to the extent that the member exercises the managerial authority vested in a manager by this Act; and (4) A manager is relieved of liability imposed by law for violation of the standards prescribed by subsections (b) through (f) to the extent of the managerial authority delegated to the members by the operating agreement. SECTION 410. (a) A member may maintain an action against a limited liability company or another member for legal or equitable relief, with or without an accounting as to the company's business, to enforce: (1) The member's rights under the operating agreement; (2) The member's rights under this Act; and (3) The rights and otherwise protect the interests of the member, including rights and interests arising independently of the member's relationship to the company. (b) The accrual, and any time limited for the assertion, of a right of action for a remedy under this section is governed by other law. A right to an accounting upon a dissolution and winding up does not revive a claim barred by law. SECTION 501. (a) A member is not a co-owner of, and has no transferable interest in, property of a limited liability company. (b) A distributional interest in a limited liability company is personal property and, subject to sections 502 and 503, may be transferred in whole or in part. (c) An operating agreement may provide that a distributional interest may be evidenced by a certificate of the interest issued by the limited liability company and, subject to section 503, may also provide for the transfer of any interest represented by the certificate. SECTION 502. A transfer of a distributional interest does not entitle the transferee to become or to exercise any rights of a member. A transfer entitles the transferee to receive, to the extent transferred, only the distributions to which the transferor would be entitled. SECTION 503. (a) A transferee of a distributional interest may become a member of a limited liability company if and to the extent that the transferor gives the transferee the right in accordance with authority described in the operating agreement or all other members consent. (b) A transferee who has become a member, to the extent transferred, has the rights and powers, and is subject to the restrictions and liabilities, of a member under the operating agreement of a limited liability company and this Act. A transferee who becomes a member also is liable for the transferor member's obligations to make contributions under section 402 and for obligations under section 407 to return unlawful distributions, but the transferee is not obligated for the transferor member's liabilities unknown to the transferee at the time the transferee becomes a member. (c) Whether or not a transferee of a distributional interest becomes a member under subsection (a), the transferor is not released from liability to the limited liability company under the operating agreement or this Act. (d) A transferee who does not become a member is not entitled to participate in the management or conduct of the limited liability company's business, require access to information concerning the company's transactions, or inspect or copy any of the company's records. (e) A transferee who does not become a member is entitled to: (1) Receive, in accordance with the transfer, distributions to which the transferor would otherwise be entitled; (2) Receive, upon dissolution and winding up of the limited liability company's business: (i) In accordance with the transfer, the net amount otherwise distributable to the transferor; (ii) A statement of account only from the date of the latest statement of account agreed to by all the members; (3) Seek under section 801(a)(5) a judicial determination that it is equitable to dissolve and wind up the company's business. (f) A limited liability company need not give effect to a transfer until it has notice of the transfer. SECTION 504. (a) On application by a judgment creditor of a member of a limited liability company or of a member's transferee, a court having jurisdiction may charge the distributional interest of the judgment debtor to satisfy the judgment. The court may appoint a receiver of the share of the distributions due or to become due to the judgment debtor and make all other orders, directions, accounts, and inquiries the judgment debtor might have made or which the circumstances may require to give effect to the charging order. (b) A charging order constitutes a lien on the judgment debtor's distributional interest. The court may order a foreclosure of a lien on a distributional interest subject to the charging order at any time. A purchaser at the foreclosure sale has the rights of a transferee. (c) At any time before foreclosure, a distributional interest in a limited liability company which is charged may be redeemed: (1) By the judgment debtor; (2) With property other than the company's property, by one or more of the other members; or (3) With the company's property, but only if permitted by the operating agreement. (d) This Act does not affect a member's right under exemption laws with respect to the member's distributional interest in a limited liability company. (e) This section provides the exclusive remedy by which a judgment creditor of a member or a transferee may satisfy a judgment out of the judgment debtor's distributional interest in a limited liability company. SECTION 601. A member is dissociated from a limited liability company upon the occurrence of any of the following events: (1) The company's having notice of the member's express will to withdraw upon the date of notice or on a later date specified by the member; (2) An event agreed to in the operating agreement as causing the member's dissociation; (3) Upon transfer of all of a member's distributional interest, other than a transfer for security purposes or a court order charging the member's distributional interest which has not been foreclosed; (4) The member's expulsion pursuant to the operating agreement; (5) The member's expulsion by unanimous vote of the other members if: (i) It is unlawful to carry on the company's business with the member; (ii) There has been a transfer of substantially all of the member's distributional interest, other than a transfer for security purposes or a court order charging the member's distributional interest which has not been foreclosed; (iii) Within ninety days after the company notifies a corporate member that it will be expelled because it has filed a certificate of dissolution or the equivalent, its charter has been revoked, or its right to conduct business has been suspended by the jurisdiction of its incorporation, the member fails to obtain a revocation of the certificate of dissolution or a reinstatement of its charter or its right to conduct business; or (iv) A partnership or a limited liability company that is a member has been dissolved and its business is being wound up; (6) On application by the company or another member, the member's expulsion by judicial determination because the member: (i) Engaged in wrongful conduct that adversely and materially affected the company's business; (ii) Willfully or persistently committed a material breach of the operating agreement or of a duty owed to the company or the other members under section 409; or (iii) Engaged in conduct relating to the company's business which makes it not reasonably practicable to carry on the business with the member; (7) The member's: (i) Becoming a debtor in bankruptcy; (ii) Executing an assignment for the benefit of creditors; (iii) Seeking, consenting to, or acquiescing in the appointment of a trustee, receiver, or liquidator of the member or of all or substantially all of the member's property; or (iv) Failing, within ninety days after the appointment, to have vacated or stayed the appointment of a trustee, receiver, or liquidator of the member or of all or substantially all of the member's property obtained without the member's consent or acquiescence, or failing within ninety days after the expiration of a stay to have the appointment vacated; (8) In the case of a member who is an individual: (i) The member's death; (ii) The appointment of a guardian or general conservator for the member; or (iii) A judicial determination that the member has otherwise become incapable of performing the member's duties under the operating agreement; (9) In the case of a member that is a trust or is acting as a member by virtue of being a trustee of a trust, distribution of the trust's entire rights to receive distributions from the company, but not merely by reason of the substitution of a successor trustee; (10) In the case of a member that is an estate or is acting as a member by virtue of being a personal representative of an estate, distribution of the estate's entire rights to receive distributions from the company, but not merely the substitution of a successor personal representative; or (11) Termination of the existence of a member if the member is not an individual, estate, or trust other than a business trust. SECTION 602. (a) Unless otherwise provided in the operating agreement, a member has the power to dissociate from a limited liability company at any time, rightfully or wrongfully, by express will pursuant to section 601(1). (b) If the operating agreement has not eliminated a member's power to dissociate, the member's dissociation from a limited liability company is wrongful only if: (1) It is in breach of an express provision of the agreement; or (2) Before the expiration of the term specified in the articles of organization if any: (i) The member withdraws by express will; (ii) The member is expelled by judicial determination under section 601(6); (iii) The member is dissociated by becoming a debtor in bankruptcy; or (iv) In the case of a member who is not an individual, trust other than a business trust, or estate, the member is expelled or otherwise dissociated because it willfully dissolved or terminated its existence. (c) A member who wrongfully dissociates from a limited liability company is liable to the company and to the other members for damages caused by the dissociation. The liability is in addition to any other obligation of the member to the company or to the other members. SECTION 603. (a) A limited liability company does not dissolve and wind up its business as result of a member's dissociation. (b) Upon a member's dissociation from a limited liability company: (1) The member's right to participate in the management and conduct of the company's business terminates, except as otherwise provided in section 803, and the member ceases to be a member and is treated the same as a transferee of a member; (2) The member's duty of loyalty under section 409(b)(3) terminates; and (3) The member's duty of loyalty under section 409(b)(1) and (2) and duty of care under section 409(c) continue only with regard to matters arising and events occurring before the member's dissociation. SECTION 604. For two years after a member dissociates without the dissociation resulting in a dissolution and winding up of a limited liability company's business, the company, including a surviving company under Article 9, is bound by an act of the dissociated member which would have bound the company under section 301 before dissociation only if at the time of entering into the transaction the other party: (1) Reasonably believed that the dissociated member was then a member; (2) Did not have notice of the member's dissociation; and (3) Is not deemed to have had notice under section 605. SECTION 605. (a) A dissociated member or a limited liability company may file in the office of the secretary of state a statement of dissociation stating the name of the company and that the member is dissociated from the company. If the statement is filed by a dissociated member a copy of the statement must also be delivered to the company by the dissociated member. (b) For the purposes of sections 301 and 604, a person not a member is deemed to have notice of the dissociation ninety days after the statement of dissociation is filed. SECTION 801. (a) A limited liability company is dissolved, and its business must be wound up, upon the occurrence of any of the following events: (1) An event specified in the operating agreement; (2) Consent of the number or percentage of members specified in the operating agreement; (3) An event that makes it unlawful for all or substantially all of the business of the company to be continued, but any cure of illegality within ninety days after notice to the company of the event is effective retroactively to the date of the event for purposes of this section; (4) On application by a member or a dissociated member, upon entry of a judicial decree that: (i) The economic purpose of the company is likely to be unreasonably frustrated; (ii) Another member has engaged in conduct relating to the company's business that makes it not reasonably practicable to carry on the company's business with that member; (iii) It is not otherwise reasonably practicable to carry on the company's business in conformity with the articles of organization and the operating agreement; or (iv) The managers or members in control of the company have acted, are acting, or will act in a manner that is illegal, oppressive, fraudulent, or unfairly prejudicial to the petitioner; or (5) On application by a transferee of a member's interest, a judicial determination that it is equitable to wind up the company's business after the expiration of a specified duration or event, if the company was for a specified duration at the time the applicant became a transferee by member dissociation, transfer, or entry of a charging order that gave rise to the transfer. SECTION 802. (a) Subject to subsection (b), a limited liability company continues after dissolution only for the purpose of winding up its business. (b) At any time after the dissolution of a limited liability company and before the winding up of its business is completed, the members may unanimously waive the right to have the company's business wound up and the company terminated. In that case: (1) The limited liability company resumes carrying on its business as if dissolution had never occurred and any liability incurred by the company or a member after the dissolution and before the waiver is determined as if the dissolution had never occurred; and (2) The rights of a third party accruing as a result of the dissolution, under section 804(a), or arising out of conduct in reliance on the dissolution before the third party knew or received a notification of the waiver are not adversely affected. SECTION 803. (a) After dissolution, a member who has not wrongfully dissociated may participate in winding up a limited liability company's business, but on application of any member, member's legal representative, or transferee, the circuit court, for good cause shown, may order judicial supervision of the winding up. (b) A legal representative of the last surviving member may wind up a limited liability company's business. (c) A person winding up a limited liability company's business may preserve the company's business or property as a going concern for a reasonable time, prosecute and defend actions and proceedings, whether civil, criminal, or administrative, settle and close the company's business, dispose of and transfer the company's property, discharge the company's liabilities, distribute the assets of the company pursuant to section 806, settle disputes by mediation or arbitration, and perform other necessary acts. SECTION 804. (a) A limited liability company is bound by a member's or manager's act after dissolution that: (1) Is appropriate for winding up the company's business; or (2) Would have bound the company under section 301 before dissolution, if the other party to the transaction did not have notice of the dissolution. (b) A member or manager who, with knowledge of the dissolution, subjects a limited liability company to liability by an act that is not appropriate for winding up the company's business is liable to the company for any damage caused to the company arising from the liability. SECTION 805. (a) At any time after dissolution and winding up, a limited liability company may terminate its existence by filing with the secretary of state articles of termination stating: (1) The name of the company; (2) The date of the dissolution; and (3) That the company's business has been wound up and the legal existence of the company has been terminated. (b) The existence of a limited liability company is terminated upon the filing of the articles of termination, or upon a later effective date, if specified in the articles of termination. SECTION 806. (a) In winding up a limited liability company's business, the assets of the company must be applied to discharge its obligations to creditors, including members who are creditors. Any surplus must be applied to pay in money the net amount distributable to members in accordance with their right to distributions under subsection (b).

The notice must: (1) Specify the information required to be included in a claim; (2) Provide a mailing address where the claim is to be sent; (3) State the deadline for receipt of the claim, which may not be less than one hundred twenty days after the date the written notice is received by the claimant; and (4) State that the claim will be barred if not received by the deadline. (c) A claim against a dissolved limited liability company is barred if the requirements of subsection (b) are met, and: (1) The claim is not received by the specified deadline; or (2) In the case of a claim that is timely received but rejected by the dissolved company, the claimant does not commence a proceeding to enforce the claim within ninety days after the receipt of the notice of the rejection. (d) For purposes of this section, claim does not include a contingent liability or a claim based on an event occurring after the effective date of dissolution. SECTION 808. (a) A dissolved limited liability company may publish notice of its dissolution and request persons having claims against the company to present them in accordance with the notice.

SECTION 809. The secretary of state may commence a proceeding to dissolve a limited liability company administratively if the company does not: (1) Pay any fees, taxes, or penalties imposed by this Act or other law within sixty days after they are due; or (2) Deliver its annual report to the secretary of state within sixty days after it is due.

(b) If the company does not correct each ground for dissolution or demonstrate to the reasonable satisfaction of the secretary of state that each ground determined by the secretary of state does not exist within sixty days after service of the notice, the secretary of state shall administratively dissolve the company by signing a certification of the dissolution that recites the ground for dissolution and its effective date.

Each manager is an agent of the company for the purpose of its business, and an act of a manager, including the signing of an instrument in the company's name, for apparently carrying on in the ordinary course the company's business or business of the kind carried on by the company binds the company, unless the manager had no authority to act for the company in the particular matter and the person with whom the manager was dealing knew or had notice that the manager lacked authority. (2) An act of a manager which is not apparently for carrying on in the ordinary course the company's business or business of the kind carried on by the company binds the company only if the act was authorized under section 404A. (c) Unless the articles of organization limit their authority, any member of a member- managed company or manager of a manager-managed company may sign and deliver any instrument transferring or affecting the company's interest in real property. The instrument is conclusive in favor of a person who gives value without knowledge of the lack of the authority of the person signing and delivering the instrument. SECTION 302. A limited liability company is liable for loss or injury caused to a person, or for a penalty incurred, as a result of a wrongful act or omission, or other actionable conduct, of a member or manager acting in the ordinary course of business of the company or with authority of the company. SECTION 303. (a) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c), the debts, obligations, and liabilities of a limited liability company, whether arising in contract, tort, or otherwise, are solely the debts, obligations, and liabilities of the company. A member or manager is not personally liable for a debt, obligation, or liability of the company solely by reason of being or acting as a member or manager. (b) The failure of a limited liability company to observe the usual company formalities or requirements relating to the exercise of its company powers or management of its business is not a ground for imposing personal liability on the members or managers for liabilities of the company. (c) All or specified members of a limited liability company are liable in their capacity as members for all or specified debts, obligations, or liabilities of the company if: (1) A provision to that effect is contained in the articles of organization; and (2) A member so liable has consented in writing to the adoption of the provision or to be bound by the provision. SECTION 401. A contribution of a member of a limited liability company may consist of tangible or intangible property or other benefit to the company, including money, promissory notes, services performed, or other agreements to contribute cash or property, or contracts for services to be performed. SECTION 402. (a) A member's obligation to contribute money, property, or other benefit to, or to perform services for, a limited liability company is not excused by the member's death, disability, or other inability to perform personally. If a member does not make the required contribution of property or services, the member is obligated at the option of the company to contribute money equal to the value of that portion of the stated contribution which has not been made. (b) A creditor of a limited liability company who extends credit or otherwise acts in reliance on an obligation described in subsection (a), and without notice of any compromise under section 404A(c)(5), may enforce the original obligation. SECTION 403. (a) A limited liability company shall reimburse a member or manager for payments made and indemnify a member or manager for liabilities incurred by the member or manager in the ordinary course of the business of the company or for the preservation of its business or property. (b) A limited liability company shall reimburse a member for an advance to the company beyond the amount of contribution the member agreed to make. (c) A payment or advance made by a member which gives rise to an obligation of a limited liability company under subsection (a) or (b) constitutes a loan to the company upon which interest accrues from the date of the payment or advance. (d) A member is not entitled to remuneration for services performed for a limited liability company, except for reasonable compensation for services rendered in winding up the business of the company. SECTION 404A. (a) In a member-managed company: (1) Each member has equal rights in the management and conduct of the company's business; and (2) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c), any matter relating to the business of the company may be decided by a majority of the members. (b) In a manager-managed company: (1) Each manager has equal rights in the management and conduct of the company's business; (2) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c), any matter relating to the business of the company may be exclusively decided by the manager or, if there is more than one manager, by a majority of the managers; and (3) A manager: (i) Must be designated, appointed, elected, removed, or replaced by a vote, approval, or consent of a majority of the members; and (ii) Holds office until a successor has been elected and qualified, unless the manager sooner resigns or is removed. (c) The only matters of a member- or manager-managed company's business requiring the consent of all of the members are: (1) The amendment of the operating agreement under section 103; (2) The authorization or ratification of acts or transactions under section 103(b)(2)(ii) which would otherwise violate the duty of loyalty; (3) An amendment to the articles of organization under section 204; (4) The compromise of an obligation to make a contribution under section 402(b); (5) The compromise, as among members, of an obligation of a member to make a contribution or return money or other property paid or distributed in violation of this Act; (6) The making of interim distributions under section 405(a), including the redemption of an interest; (7) The admission of a new member; (8) The use of the company's property to redeem an interest subject to a charging order; (9) The consent to dissolve the company under section 801(a)(2); (10) A waiver of the right to have the company's business wound up and the company terminated under section 802(b); (11) The consent of members to merge with another entity under section 904(c)(1); and (12) The sale, lease, exchange, or other disposal of all, or substantially all, of the company's property with or without goodwill. (d) Action requiring the consent of members or managers under this Act may be taken without a meeting. (e) A member or manager may appoint a proxy to vote or otherwise act for the member or manager by signing an appointment instrument, either personally or by the member's or manager's attorney-in-fact. SECTION 404B. Nothing in this Act prohibits the articles of organization from establishing classes or groups of one or more members having certain expressed relative rights, powers, or duties, including voting rights and the articles of organization may provide for the future creation, in the manner provided in the articles of organization, of additional classes or groups of members having certain relative rights, powers, or duties, including voting rights, expressed either in the regulations or at the time of creation. The rights, powers, or duties of a class or group may be senior to those of one or more existing classes or groups of members. SECTION 405. (a) Any distributions made by a limited liability company before its dissolution and winding up must be in equal shares. (b) A member has no right to receive, and may not be required to accept, a distribution in kind. (c) If a member becomes entitled to receive a distribution, the member has the status of, and is entitled to all remedies available to, a creditor of the limited liability company with respect to the distribution. SECTION 406. (a) A distribution may not be made if: (1) The limited liability company would not be able to pay its debts as they become due in the ordinary course of business; or (2) The company's total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities plus the amount that would be needed, if the company were to be dissolved, wound up, and terminated at the time of the distribution, to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution, winding up, and termination of members whose preferential rights are superior to those receiving the distribution. (b) A limited liability company may base a determination that a distribution is not prohibited under subsection (a) on financial statements prepared on the basis of accounting practices and principles that are reasonable in the circumstances or on a fair valuation or other method that is reasonable in the circumstances. (c) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (e), the effect of a distribution under subsection (a) is measured: (1) In the case of distribution by purchase, redemption, or other acquisition of a distributional interest in a limited liability company, as of the date money or other property is transferred or debt incurred by the company; and (2) In all other cases, as of the date the: (i) Distribution is authorized if the payment occurs within one hundred twenty days after the date of authorization; or (ii) Payment is made if it occurs more than one hundred twenty days after the date of authorization. (d) A limited liability company's indebtedness to a member incurred by reason of a distribution made in accordance with this section is at parity with the company's indebtedness to its general, unsecured creditors. (e) Indebtedness of a limited liability company, including indebtedness issued in connection with or as part of a distribution, is not considered a liability for purposes of determinations under subsection (a) if its terms provide that payment of principal and interest are made only if and to the extent that payment of a distribution to members could then be made under this section. If the indebtedness is issued as a distribution, each payment of principal or interest on the indebtedness is treated as a distribution, the effect of which is measured on the date the payment is made. SECTION 407. (a) Any member of a member-managed company or a member or manager of a manager-managed company who votes for or assents to a distribution made in violation of section 406, the articles of organization, or the operating agreement is personally liable to the company for the amount of the distribution which exceeds the amount that could have been distributed without violating section 406, the articles of organization, or the operating agreement if it is established that the member or manager did not perform the member's or manager's duties in compliance with section 409. (b) A member of a manager-managed company who knew a distribution was made in violation of section 406, the articles of organization, or the operating agreement is personally liable to the company, but only to the extent that the distribution received by the member exceeded the amount that could have been properly paid under section 406. (c) A member or manager against whom an action is brought under this section may implead in the action all: (1) Other members or managers who voted for or assented to the distribution in violation of subsection (a) and may compel contribution from them; and (2) Members who received a distribution in violation of subsection (b) and may compel contribution from the member in the amount received in violation of subsection (b). (d) A proceeding under this section is barred unless it is commenced within two years after the distribution. SECTION 408. (a) A limited liability company shall provide members and their agents and attorneys access for proper purposes to its records, if any, at the company's principal office or other reasonable locations specified in the operating agreement. The company shall provide former members and their agents and attorneys access for proper purposes to records pertaining to the period during which they were members. The right of access provides the opportunity to inspect and copy records during ordinary business hours. The company may impose a reasonable charge, limited to the costs of labor and material, for copies of records furnished. (b) A limited liability company shall furnish to a member, and to the legal representative of a deceased member or member under legal disability: (1) Without demand, information concerning the company's business or affairs reasonably required for the proper exercise of the member's rights and performance of the member's duties under the operating agreement or this Act; and (2) On demand, other information concerning the company's business or affairs, except to the extent the demand or the information demanded is unreasonable or otherwise improper under the circumstances. (c) A member has the right upon written demand given to the limited liability company to obtain at the company's expense a copy of any written operating agreement. SECTION 409. (a) The only fiduciary duties a member owes to a member-managed company and its other members are the duty of loyalty and the duty of care imposed by subsections (b) and (c). (b) A member's duty of loyalty to a member-managed company and its other members is limited to the following: (1) To account to the company and to hold as trustee for it any property, profit, or benefit derived by the member in the conduct or winding up of the company's business or derived from a use by the member of the company's property, including the appropriation of a company's opportunity; (2) To refrain from dealing with the company in the conduct or winding up of the company's business as or on behalf of a party having an interest adverse to the company; and (3) To refrain from competing with the company in the conduct of the company's business before the dissolution of the company. (c) A member's duty of care to a member-managed company and its other members in the conduct of and winding up of the company's business is limited to refraining from engaging in grossly negligent or reckless conduct, intentional misconduct, or a knowing violation of law. (d) A member shall discharge the duties to a member-managed company and its other members under this Act or under the operating agreement and exercise any rights consistently with the obligation of good faith and fair dealing. (e) A member of a member-managed company does not violate a duty or obligation under this Act or under the operating agreement merely because the member's conduct furthers the member's own interest. (f) A member of a member-managed company may lend money to and transact other business with the company. As to each loan or transaction, the rights and obligations of the member are the same as those of a person who is not a member, subject to other applicable law. (g) This section applies to a person winding up the limited liability company's business as the personal or legal representative of the last surviving member as if the person were a member. (h) In a manager-managed company: (1) A member who is not also a manager owes no duties to the company or to the other members solely by reason of being a member; (2) A manager is held to the same standards of conduct prescribed for members in subsections (b) through (f); (3) A member who pursuant to the operating agreement exercises some or all of the rights of a manager in the management and conduct of the company's business is held to the standards of conduct in subsections (b) through (f) to the extent that the member exercises the managerial authority vested in a manager by this Act; and (4) A manager is relieved of liability imposed by law for violation of the standards prescribed by subsections (b) through (f) to the extent of the managerial authority delegated to the members by the operating agreement. SECTION 410. (a) A member may maintain an action against a limited liability company or another member for legal or equitable relief, with or without an accounting as to the company's business, to enforce: (1) The member's rights under the operating agreement; (2) The member's rights under this Act; and (3) The rights and otherwise protect the interests of the member, including rights and interests arising independently of the member's relationship to the company. (b) The accrual, and any time limited for the assertion, of a right of action for a remedy under this section is governed by other law. A right to an accounting upon a dissolution and winding up does not revive a claim barred by law. SECTION 501. (a) A member is not a co-owner of, and has no transferable interest in, property of a limited liability company. (b) A distributional interest in a limited liability company is personal property and, subject to sections 502 and 503, may be transferred in whole or in part. (c) An operating agreement may provide that a distributional interest may be evidenced by a certificate of the interest issued by the limited liability company and, subject to section 503, may also provide for the transfer of any interest represented by the certificate. SECTION 502. A transfer of a distributional interest does not entitle the transferee to become or to exercise any rights of a member. A transfer entitles the transferee to receive, to the extent transferred, only the distributions to which the transferor would be entitled. SECTION 503. (a) A transferee of a distributional interest may become a member of a limited liability company if and to the extent that the transferor gives the transferee the right in accordance with authority described in the operating agreement or all other members consent. (b) A transferee who has become a member, to the extent transferred, has the rights and powers, and is subject to the restrictions and liabilities, of a member under the operating agreement of a limited liability company and this Act. A transferee who becomes a member also is liable for the transferor member's obligations to make contributions under section 402 and for obligations under section 407 to return unlawful distributions, but the transferee is not obligated for the transferor member's liabilities unknown to the transferee at the time the transferee becomes a member. (c) Whether or not a transferee of a distributional interest becomes a member under subsection (a), the transferor is not released from liability to the limited liability company under the operating agreement or this Act. (d) A transferee who does not become a member is not entitled to participate in the management or conduct of the limited liability company's business, require access to information concerning the company's transactions, or inspect or copy any of the company's records. (e) A transferee who does not become a member is entitled to: (1) Receive, in accordance with the transfer, distributions to which the transferor would otherwise be entitled; (2) Receive, upon dissolution and winding up of the limited liability company's business: (i) In accordance with the transfer, the net amount otherwise distributable to the transferor; (ii) A statement of account only from the date of the latest statement of account agreed to by all the members; (3) Seek under section 801(a)(5) a judicial determination that it is equitable to dissolve and wind up the company's business. (f) A limited liability company need not give effect to a transfer until it has notice of the transfer. SECTION 504. (a) On application by a judgment creditor of a member of a limited liability company or of a member's transferee, a court having jurisdiction may charge the distributional interest of the judgment debtor to satisfy the judgment. The court may appoint a receiver of the share of the distributions due or to become due to the judgment debtor and make all other orders, directions, accounts, and inquiries the judgment debtor might have made or which the circumstances may require to give effect to the charging order. (b) A charging order constitutes a lien on the judgment debtor's distributional interest. The court may order a foreclosure of a lien on a distributional interest subject to the charging order at any time. A purchaser at the foreclosure sale has the rights of a transferee. (c) At any time before foreclosure, a distributional interest in a limited liability company which is charged may be redeemed: (1) By the judgment debtor; (2) With property other than the company's property, by one or more of the other members; or (3) With the company's property, but only if permitted by the operating agreement. (d) This Act does not affect a member's right under exemption laws with respect to the member's distributional interest in a limited liability company. (e) This section provides the exclusive remedy by which a judgment creditor of a member or a transferee may satisfy a judgment out of the judgment debtor's distributional interest in a limited liability company. SECTION 601. A member is dissociated from a limited liability company upon the occurrence of any of the following events: (1) The company's having notice of the member's express will to withdraw upon the date of notice or on a later date specified by the member; (2) An event agreed to in the operating agreement as causing the member's dissociation; (3) Upon transfer of all of a member's distributional interest, other than a transfer for security purposes or a court order charging the member's distributional interest which has not been foreclosed; (4) The member's expulsion pursuant to the operating agreement; (5) The member's expulsion by unanimous vote of the other members if: (i) It is unlawful to carry on the company's business with the member; (ii) There has been a transfer of substantially all of the member's distributional interest, other than a transfer for security purposes or a court order charging the member's distributional interest which has not been foreclosed; (iii) Within ninety days after the company notifies a corporate member that it will be expelled because it has filed a certificate of dissolution or the equivalent, its charter has been revoked, or its right to conduct business has been suspended by the jurisdiction of its incorporation, the member fails to obtain a revocation of the certificate of dissolution or a reinstatement of its charter or its right to conduct business; or (iv) A partnership or a limited liability company that is a member has been dissolved and its business is being wound up; (6) On application by the company or another member, the member's expulsion by judicial determination because the member: (i) Engaged in wrongful conduct that adversely and materially affected the company's business; (ii) Willfully or persistently committed a material breach of the operating agreement or of a duty owed to the company or the other members under section 409; or (iii) Engaged in conduct relating to the company's business which makes it not reasonably practicable to carry on the business with the member; (7) The member's: (i) Becoming a debtor in bankruptcy; (ii) Executing an assignment for the benefit of creditors; (iii) Seeking, consenting to, or acquiescing in the appointment of a trustee, receiver, or liquidator of the member or of all or substantially all of the member's property; or (iv) Failing, within ninety days after the appointment, to have vacated or stayed the appointment of a trustee, receiver, or liquidator of the member or of all or substantially all of the member's property obtained without the member's consent or acquiescence, or failing within ninety days after the expiration of a stay to have the appointment vacated; (8) In the case of a member who is an individual: (i) The member's death; (ii) The appointment of a guardian or general conservator for the member; or (iii) A judicial determination that the member has otherwise become incapable of performing the member's duties under the operating agreement; (9) In the case of a member that is a trust or is acting as a member by virtue of being a trustee of a trust, distribution of the trust's entire rights to receive distributions from the company, but not merely by reason of the substitution of a successor trustee; (10) In the case of a member that is an estate or is acting as a member by virtue of being a personal representative of an estate, distribution of the estate's entire rights to receive distributions from the company, but not merely the substitution of a successor personal representative; or (11) Termination of the existence of a member if the member is not an individual, estate, or trust other than a business trust. SECTION 602. (a) Unless otherwise provided in the operating agreement, a member has the power to dissociate from a limited liability company at any time, rightfully or wrongfully, by express will pursuant to section 601(1). (b) If the operating agreement has not eliminated a member's power to dissociate, the member's dissociation from a limited liability company is wrongful only if: (1) It is in breach of an express provision of the agreement; or (2) Before the expiration of the term specified in the articles of organization if any: (i) The member withdraws by express will; (ii) The member is expelled by judicial determination under section 601(6); (iii) The member is dissociated by becoming a debtor in bankruptcy; or (iv) In the case of a member who is not an individual, trust other than a business trust, or estate, the member is expelled or otherwise dissociated because it willfully dissolved or terminated its existence. (c) A member who wrongfully dissociates from a limited liability company is liable to the company and to the other members for damages caused by the dissociation. The liability is in addition to any other obligation of the member to the company or to the other members. SECTION 603. (a) A limited liability company does not dissolve and wind up its business as result of a member's dissociation. (b) Upon a member's dissociation from a limited liability company: (1) The member's right to participate in the management and conduct of the company's business terminates, except as otherwise provided in section 803, and the member ceases to be a member and is treated the same as a transferee of a member; (2) The member's duty of loyalty under section 409(b)(3) terminates; and (3) The member's duty of loyalty under section 409(b)(1) and (2) and duty of care under section 409(c) continue only with regard to matters arising and events occurring before the member's dissociation. SECTION 604. For two years after a member dissociates without the dissociation resulting in a dissolution and winding up of a limited liability company's business, the company, including a surviving company under Article 9, is bound by an act of the dissociated member which would have bound the company under section 301 before dissociation only if at the time of entering into the transaction the other party: (1) Reasonably believed that the dissociated member was then a member; (2) Did not have notice of the member's dissociation; and (3) Is not deemed to have had notice under section 605. SECTION 605. (a) A dissociated member or a limited liability company may file in the office of the secretary of state a statement of dissociation stating the name of the company and that the member is dissociated from the company. If the statement is filed by a dissociated member a copy of the statement must also be delivered to the company by the dissociated member. (b) For the purposes of sections 301 and 604, a person not a member is deemed to have notice of the dissociation ninety days after the statement of dissociation is filed. SECTION 801. (a) A limited liability company is dissolved, and its business must be wound up, upon the occurrence of any of the following events: (1) An event specified in the operating agreement; (2) Consent of the number or percentage of members specified in the operating agreement; (3) An event that makes it unlawful for all or substantially all of the business of the company to be continued, but any cure of illegality within ninety days after notice to the company of the event is effective retroactively to the date of the event for purposes of this section; (4) On application by a member or a dissociated member, upon entry of a judicial decree that: (i) The economic purpose of the company is likely to be unreasonably frustrated; (ii) Another member has engaged in conduct relating to the company's business that makes it not reasonably practicable to carry on the company's business with that member; (iii) It is not otherwise reasonably practicable to carry on the company's business in conformity with the articles of organization and the operating agreement; or (iv) The managers or members in control of the company have acted, are acting, or will act in a manner that is illegal, oppressive, fraudulent, or unfairly prejudicial to the petitioner; or (5) On application by a transferee of a member's interest, a judicial determination that it is equitable to wind up the company's business after the expiration of a specified duration or event, if the company was for a specified duration at the time the applicant became a transferee by member dissociation, transfer, or entry of a charging order that gave rise to the transfer. SECTION 802. (a) Subject to subsection (b), a limited liability company continues after dissolution only for the purpose of winding up its business. (b) At any time after the dissolution of a limited liability company and before the winding up of its business is completed, the members may unanimously waive the right to have the company's business wound up and the company terminated. In that case: (1) The limited liability company resumes carrying on its business as if dissolution had never occurred and any liability incurred by the company or a member after the dissolution and before the waiver is determined as if the dissolution had never occurred; and (2) The rights of a third party accruing as a result of the dissolution, under section 804(a), or arising out of conduct in reliance on the dissolution before the third party knew or received a notification of the waiver are not adversely affected. SECTION 803. (a) After dissolution, a member who has not wrongfully dissociated may participate in winding up a limited liability company's business, but on application of any member, member's legal representative, or transferee, the circuit court, for good cause shown, may order judicial supervision of the winding up. (b) A legal representative of the last surviving member may wind up a limited liability company's business. (c) A person winding up a limited liability company's business may preserve the company's business or property as a going concern for a reasonable time, prosecute and defend actions and proceedings, whether civil, criminal, or administrative, settle and close the company's business, dispose of and transfer the company's property, discharge the company's liabilities, distribute the assets of the company pursuant to section 806, settle disputes by mediation or arbitration, and perform other necessary acts. SECTION 804. (a) A limited liability company is bound by a member's or manager's act after dissolution that: (1) Is appropriate for winding up the company's business; or (2) Would have bound the company under section 301 before dissolution, if the other party to the transaction did not have notice of the dissolution. (b) A member or manager who, with knowledge of the dissolution, subjects a limited liability company to liability by an act that is not appropriate for winding up the company's business is liable to the company for any damage caused to the company arising from the liability. SECTION 805. (a) At any time after dissolution and winding up, a limited liability company may terminate its existence by filing with the secretary of state articles of termination stating: (1) The name of the company; (2) The date of the dissolution; and (3) That the company's business has been wound up and the legal existence of the company has been terminated. (b) The existence of a limited liability company is terminated upon the filing of the articles of termination, or upon a later effective date, if specified in the articles of termination. SECTION 806. (a) In winding up a limited liability company's business, the assets of the company must be applied to discharge its obligations to creditors, including members who are creditors. Any surplus must be applied to pay in money the net amount distributable to members in accordance with their right to distributions under subsection (b). (b) Each member is entitled to a distribution upon the winding up of the limited liability company's business consisting of a return of all contributions which have not previously been returned and a distribution of any remainder in equal shares. SECTION 807. (a) A dissolved limited liability company may dispose of the known claims against it by following the procedure described in this section. (b) A dissolved limited liability company shall notify its known claimants in writing of the dissolution. The notice must: (1) Specify the information required to be included in a claim; (2) Provide a mailing address where the claim is to be sent; (3) State the deadline for receipt of the claim, which may not be less than one hundred twenty days after the date the written notice is received by the claimant; and (4) State that the claim will be barred if not received by the deadline. (c) A claim against a dissolved limited liability company is barred if the requirements of subsection (b) are met, and: (1) The claim is not received by the specified deadline; or (2) In the case of a claim that is timely received but rejected by the dissolved company, the claimant does not commence a proceeding to enforce the claim within ninety days after the receipt of the notice of the rejection. (d) For purposes of this section, claim does not include a contingent liability or a claim based on an event occurring after the effective date of dissolution. SECTION 808. (a) A dissolved limited liability company may publish notice of its dissolution and request persons having claims against the company to present them in accordance with the notice. (b) The notice must: (1) Be published at least once in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the dissolved limited liability company's principal office is located or, if none in this state, in which its registered office is or was last located; (2) Describe the information required to be contained in a claim and provide a mailing address where the claim is to be sent; and (3) State that a claim against the limited liability company is barred unless a proceeding to enforce the claim is commenced within five years after publication of the notice.

(d) A claim not barred under this section may be enforced: (1) Against the dissolved limited liability company, to the extent of its undistributed assets; or (2) If the assets have been distributed in liquidation, against a member of the dissolved company to the extent of the member's proportionate share of the claim or the company's assets distributed to the member in liquidation, whichever is less, but a member's total liability for all claims under this section may not exceed the total amount of assets distributed to the member. SECTION 809. The secretary of state may commence a proceeding to dissolve a limited liability company administratively if the company does not: (1) Pay any fees, taxes, or penalties imposed by this Act or other law within sixty days after they are due; or (2) Deliver its annual report to the secretary of state within sixty days after it is due. SECTION 810. (a) If the secretary of state determines that a ground exists for administratively dissolving a limited liability company, the secretary of state shall enter a record of the determination and serve the company with a copy of the record. (b) If the company does not correct each ground for dissolution or demonstrate to the reasonable satisfaction of the secretary of state that each ground determined by the secretary of state does not exist within sixty days after service of the notice, the secretary of state shall administratively dissolve the company by signing a certification of the dissolution that recites the ground for dissolution and its effective date. The secretary of state shall file the original of the certificate and serve the company with a copy of the certificate.

(d) A foreign limited liability company whose registration is effective may qualify as a foreign company under its name or consent in writing to the use of its name by a limited liability company later organized under this Act or by another foreign company later authorized to transact business in this State. The registered name terminates when the limited liability company is organized or the foreign company qualifies or consents to the qualification of another foreign company under the registered name. SECTION 108. Each limited liability company shall have, and continuously maintain in this state, a registered office which may be, but need not be, the same as its place of business, and a registered agent, which agent may be either an individual resident in this state whose business office is identical with such registered office, or a domestic corporation, or a foreign corporation authorized to transact business in this state, having a business office identical with such registered office. SECTION 109. A limited liability company may change its registered office or agent, or both, upon filing in the Office of the Secretary of State a statement setting forth: (1) The name of the limited lability company; (2) The current address of its registered office; (3) If there is a change of address of its registered office, the now address of the registered office; (4) The name of its registered agent; (5) If there is a change of its registered agent, the name of its successor registered agent; (6) That the address of its registered office and the address of the business office of its registered agent, as changed, will be identical; (7) That the change was authorized by affirmative vote of a majority of the members of the limited liability company. The statement shall be verified by one or more of its managers if management of the limited liability company has been vested by the members in a manager or managers or if management of the limited liability company is retained by the members, then by any member and delivered to the secretary of state. If the secretary of state finds that the statement conforms to the provisions of this Act, the secretary of state shall file the statement, and upon filing, the change of address of the registered office or the appointment of a new registered agent, or both, is effective. SECTION 110. Any registered agent of a limited liability company may resign as agent upon filing a written notice of resignation, executed with the secretary of state, who shall forthwith mail a copy of the resignation to the limited liability company at its registered office by certified mail, return receipt requested. The appointment of the agent shall terminate upon the expiration of thirty days after receipt of notice by the secretary of state. SECTION 111. (a) The registered agent appointed by a limited liability company or a foreign limited liability company shall be an agent of the limited liability company upon whom any process, notice, or demand required or permitted by law to be served upon the limited liability company may be served. (b) If a limited liability company fails to appoint or maintain a registered agent in this state, or if its registered agent cannot be found at its registered office, the secretary of state shall be an agent of the company upon whom any process, notice or demand may be served. Service on the secretary of state of any process, notice or demand shall be made by delivering to the secretary of state or any clerk having charge of the limited liability department an original and one exact or conforming copy of the process, notice, or demand.

(a) A limited liability company may be organized under this Act for any lawful purpose, subject to any law of this state governing or regulating business including regulation of professional service firms. Limited liability companies may not engage in activities proscribed by chapter 47-9A unless the ownership restrictions are met by the membership of the limited liability company by substitution of members for shareholders in that chapter. (b) Unless its articles of organization provide otherwise, a limited liability company has the same powers as an individual to do all things necessary or convenient to carry on its business or affairs, including power to: (1) Sue and be sued, and defend in its name; (2) Purchase, receive, lease, or otherwise acquire, and own, hold, improve, use, and otherwise deal with real or personal property, or any legal or equitable interest in property, wherever located; (3) Sell, convey, mortgage, grant a security interest in, lease, exchange, and otherwise encumber or dispose of all or any part of its property; (4) Purchase, receive, subscribe for, or otherwise acquire, own, hold, vote, use, sell, mortgage, lend, grant a security interest in, or otherwise dispose of and deal in and with, shares or other interests in or obligations of any other entity; (5) Make contracts and guarantees, incur liabilities, borrow money, issue its notes, bonds, and other obligations, which may be convertible into or include the option to purchase other securities of the limited liability company, and secure any of its obligations by a mortgage on or a security interest in any of its property, franchises, or income; (6) Lend money, invest and reinvest its funds, and receive and hold real and personal property as security for repayment; (7) Be a promoter, partner, member, associate, or manager of any partnership, joint venture, trust, or other entity including but not limited to limited partnerships and limited liability companies; (8) Conduct its business, locate offices, and exercise the powers granted by this Act within or without this state; (9) Elect managers and appoint officers, employees, and agents of the limited liability company, define their duties, fix their compensation, and lend them money and credit, or otherwise assist its members; (10) Pay pensions and establish pension plans, pension trusts, profit sharing plans, bonus plans, option plans, and benefit or incentive plans for any or all of its current or former members, managers, officers, employees, and agents; (11) Make donations for the public welfare or for charitable, scientific, or educational purposes; and (12) Make payments or donations, or do any other act, not inconsistent with law, that furthers the business of the limited liability company. SECTION 201. A limited liability company is a legal entity distinct from its members. A member of a limited liability company is not a proper party to proceedings by or against a limited liability company. SECTION 202A. (a) One or more persons may organize a limited liability company, consisting of one or more members, by delivering articles of organization to the Office of the Secretary of State for filing. (b) Unless a delayed effective date is specified in accordance with section 206(d), the existence of a limited liability company begins when the articles of organization and the first annual report as required in section 211(c) are filed. (c) The original and one exact or conforming copy of the articles of organization and the first annual report shall be delivered to the secretary of state. If the secretary of state finds that the articles of organization and the annual report conform to law, the secretary of state shall, when all fees have been paid as prescribed: (1) Endorse both the original and the exact or conforming copy with the word, Filed, and the month, date, and year of the filing; (2) File the original; (3) Issue a certificate of organization and affix to the certificate, the exact or conforming copy. The certificate of organization, together with the exact or conforming copy of the articles of organization affixed to it by the secretary of state, shall be returned to the principal office of the limited liability company or to its representative. SECTION 202B. Upon the issuance of the certificate of organization, the limited liability company shall be considered organized, and such certificate of organization shall be conclusive evidence that all conditions precedent required to be performed by the members have been complied with and that the limited liability company has been legally organized under this Act, except as against this state in a proceeding to cancel or revoke the certificate of organization or for involuntary dissolution of the limited liability company. No limited liability company may transact business or incur indebtedness, except that which is incidental to its organization, or except for obtaining subscriptions for or payment of contributions, until the secretary of state has issued a certificate of organization.

The articles of amendment must set forth the: (1) Name of the limited liability company; (2) Date of filing of the articles of organization; and (3) Amendment to the articles.

(c) Any person may sign a record to be filed under subsection (a) by an attorney-in-fact. Powers of attorney relating to the signing of records to be filed under subsection (a) by an attorney-in-fact need not be filed in the Office of the Secretary of State as evidence of authority by the person filing but must be retained by the company. SECTION 206. (a) Articles of organization or any other record authorized to be filed under this Act must be in a medium permitted by the secretary of state and must be delivered to the Office of the Secretary of State.

(b) Upon request and payment of a fee, the secretary of state shall send to the requester a certified copy of the requested record. (c) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (d), sections 202A and 202B, and subsection 207(c), a record accepted for filing by the secretary of state is effective: (1) At the time of filing on the date it is filed, as evidenced by the secretary of state's date and time endorsement on the original record; or (2) At the time specified in the record as its effective time on the date it is filed. (d) A record, including the articles of organization, may specify a delayed effective time and date, and if it does so the record becomes effective at the time and date specified subject to the other requirements of this Act. If a delayed effective date but no time is specified, the record is effective at the close of business on that date. If a delayed effective date is later than the ninetieth day after the record is filed, the record is effective on the ninetieth day. SECTION 207. (a) A limited liability company or foreign limited liability company may correct a record filed by the secretary of state if the record contains a false or erroneous statement or was defectively signed. (b) A record is corrected: (1) By preparing articles of correction that: (i) Describe the record, including its filing date, or attach a copy of it to the articles of correction; (ii) Specify the incorrect statement and the reason it is incorrect or the manner in which the signing was defective; and (iii) Correct the incorrect statement or defective signing; and (2) By delivering the corrected record to the secretary of state for filing. (c) Articles of correction are effective retroactively on the effective date of the record they correct except as to persons relying on the uncorrected record and adversely affected by the correction. As to those persons, articles of correction are effective when filed. SECTION 208.

If a person required by section 205 to sign any record fails or refuses to do so, any other person who is adversely affected by the failure or refusal may petition the state circuit court to direct the signing of the record. If the court finds that it is proper for the record to be signed and that a person so designated has failed or refused to sign the record, it shall order the secretary of state to sign and file an appropriate record. SECTION 211.

Subsequent annual reports must be delivered to the secretary of state before the first day of the second month following the anniversary month of the filing date. (d) If an annual report does not contain the information required in subsection (a) or the fees required by section 212, the secretary of state shall promptly notify the reporting limited liability company or foreign limited liability company and return the report to it for correction.

(2) An act of a member which is not apparently for carrying on in the ordinary course the company's business or business of the kind carried on by the company binds the company only if the act was authorized by the other members. (b) Subject to subsection (c), in a manager-managed company: (1) A member is not an agent of the company for the purpose of its business solely by reason of being a member. Each manager is an agent of the company for the purpose of its business, and an act of a manager, including the signing of an instrument in the company's name, for apparently carrying on in the ordinary course the company's business or business of the kind carried on by the company binds the company, unless the manager had no authority to act for the company in the particular matter and the person with whom the manager was dealing knew or had notice that the manager lacked authority. (2) An act of a manager which is not apparently for carrying on in the ordinary course the company's business or business of the kind carried on by the company binds the company only if the act was authorized under section 404A. (c) Unless the articles of organization limit their authority, any member of a member- managed company or manager of a manager-managed company may sign and deliver any instrument transferring or affecting the company's interest in real property. The instrument is conclusive in favor of a person who gives value without knowledge of the lack of the authority of the person signing and delivering the instrument. SECTION 302.

SECTION 303. (a) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c), the debts, obligations, and liabilities of a limited liability company, whether arising in contract, tort, or otherwise, are solely the debts, obligations, and liabilities of the company. A member or manager is not personally liable for a debt, obligation, or liability of the company solely by reason of being or acting as a member or manager. (b) The failure of a limited liability company to observe the usual company formalities or requirements relating to the exercise of its company powers or management of its business is not a ground for imposing personal liability on the members or managers for liabilities of the company. (c) All or specified members of a limited liability company are liable in their capacity as members for all or specified debts, obligations, or liabilities of the company if: (1) A provision to that effect is contained in the articles of organization; and (2) A member so liable has consented in writing to the adoption of the provision or to be bound by the provision.

SECTION 402. (a) A member's obligation to contribute money, property, or other benefit to, or to perform services for, a limited liability company is not excused by the member's death, disability, or other inability to perform personally. If a member does not make the required contribution of property or services, the member is obligated at the option of the company to contribute money equal to the value of that portion of the stated contribution which has not been made. (b) A creditor of a limited liability company who extends credit or otherwise acts in reliance on an obligation described in subsection (a), and without notice of any compromise under section 404A(c)(5), may enforce the original obligation. SECTION 403. (a) A limited liability company shall reimburse a member or manager for payments made and indemnify a member or manager for liabilities incurred by the member or manager in the ordinary course of the business of the company or for the preservation of its business or property. (b) A limited liability company shall reimburse a member for an advance to the company beyond the amount of contribution the member agreed to make. (c) A payment or advance made by a member which gives rise to an obligation of a limited liability company under subsection (a) or (b) constitutes a loan to the company upon which interest accrues from the date of the payment or advance. (d) A member is not entitled to remuneration for services performed for a limited liability company, except for reasonable compensation for services rendered in winding up the business of the company. SECTION 404A. (a) In a member-managed company: (1) Each member has equal rights in the management and conduct of the company's business; and (2) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c), any matter relating to the business of the company may be decided by a majority of the members.

(e) A member or manager may appoint a proxy to vote or otherwise act for the member or manager by signing an appointment instrument, either personally or by the member's or manager's attorney-in-fact. SECTION 404B. Nothing in this Act prohibits the articles of organization from establishing classes or groups of one or more members having certain expressed relative rights, powers, or duties, including voting rights and the articles of organization may provide for the future creation, in the manner provided in the articles of organization, of additional classes or groups of members having certain relative rights, powers, or duties, including voting rights, expressed either in the regulations or at the time of creation. The rights, powers, or duties of a class or group may be senior to those of one or more existing classes or groups of members. SECTION 405. (a) Any distributions made by a limited liability company before its dissolution and winding up must be in equal shares. (b) A member has no right to receive, and may not be required to accept, a distribution in kind. (c) If a member becomes entitled to receive a distribution, the member has the status of, and is entitled to all remedies available to, a creditor of the limited liability company with respect to the distribution. SECTION 406. (a) A distribution may not be made if: (1) The limited liability company would not be able to pay its debts as they become due in the ordinary course of business; or (2) The company's total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities plus the amount that would be needed, if the company were to be dissolved, wound up, and terminated at the time of the distribution, to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution, winding up, and termination of members whose preferential rights are superior to those receiving the distribution. (b) A limited liability company may base a determination that a distribution is not prohibited under subsection (a) on financial statements prepared on the basis of accounting practices and principles that are reasonable in the circumstances or on a fair valuation or other method that is reasonable in the circumstances. (c) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (e), the effect of a distribution under subsection (a) is measured: (1) In the case of distribution by purchase, redemption, or other acquisition of a distributional interest in a limited liability company, as of the date money or other property is transferred or debt incurred by the company; and (2) In all other cases, as of the date the: (i) Distribution is authorized if the payment occurs within one hundred twenty days after the date of authorization; or (ii) Payment is made if it occurs more than one hundred twenty days after the date of authorization. (d) A limited liability company's indebtedness to a member incurred by reason of a distribution made in accordance with this section is at parity with the company's indebtedness to its general, unsecured creditors. (e) Indebtedness of a limited liability company, including indebtedness issued in connection with or as part of a distribution, is not considered a liability for purposes of determinations under subsection (a) if its terms provide that payment of principal and interest are made only if and to the extent that payment of a distribution to members could then be made under this section. If the indebtedness is issued as a distribution, each payment of principal or interest on the indebtedness is treated as a distribution, the effect of which is measured on the date the payment is made. SECTION 407. (a) Any member of a member-managed company or a member or manager of a manager-managed company who votes for or assents to a distribution made in violation of section 406, the articles of organization, or the operating agreement is personally liable to the company for the amount of the distribution which exceeds the amount that could have been distributed without violating section 406, the articles of organization, or the operating agreement if it is established that the member or manager did not perform the member's or manager's duties in compliance with section 409. (b) A member of a manager-managed company who knew a distribution was made in violation of section 406, the articles of organization, or the operating agreement is personally liable to the company, but only to the extent that the distribution received by the member exceeded the amount that could have been properly paid under section 406. (c) A member or manager against whom an action is brought under this section may implead in the action all: (1) Other members or managers who voted for or assented to the distribution in violation of subsection (a) and may compel contribution from them; and (2) Members who received a distribution in violation of subsection (b) and may compel contribution from the member in the amount received in violation of subsection (b).

(a) A limited liability company shall provide members and their agents and attorneys access for proper purposes to its records, if any, at the company's principal office or other reasonable locations specified in the operating agreement. The company shall provide former members and their agents and attorneys access for proper purposes to records pertaining to the period during which they were members. The right of access provides the opportunity to inspect and copy records during ordinary business hours. The company may impose a reasonable charge, limited to the costs of labor and material, for copies of records furnished. (b) A limited liability company shall furnish to a member, and to the legal representative of a deceased member or member under legal disability: (1) Without demand, information concerning the company's business or affairs reasonably required for the proper exercise of the member's rights and performance of the member's duties under the operating agreement or this Act; and (2) On demand, other information concerning the company's business or affairs, except to the extent the demand or the information demanded is unreasonable or otherwise improper under the circumstances. (c) A member has the right upon written demand given to the limited liability company to obtain at the company's expense a copy of any written operating agreement. SECTION 409. (a) The only fiduciary duties a member owes to a member-managed company and its other members are the duty of loyalty and the duty of care imposed by subsections (b) and (c). (b) A member's duty of loyalty to a member-managed company and its other members is limited to the following: (1) To account to the company and to hold as trustee for it any property, profit, or benefit derived by the member in the conduct or winding up of the company's business or derived from a use by the member of the company's property, including the appropriation of a company's opportunity; (2) To refrain from dealing with the company in the conduct or winding up of the company's business as or on behalf of a party having an interest adverse to the company; and (3) To refrain from competing with the company in the conduct of the company's business before the dissolution of the company. (c) A member's duty of care to a member-managed company and its other members in the conduct of and winding up of the company's business is limited to refraining from engaging in grossly negligent or reckless conduct, intentional misconduct, or a knowing violation of law. (d) A member shall discharge the duties to a member-managed company and its other members under this Act or under the operating agreement and exercise any rights consistently with the obligation of good faith and fair dealing. (e) A member of a member-managed company does not violate a duty or obligation under this Act or under the operating agreement merely because the member's conduct furthers the member's own interest. (f) A member of a member-managed company may lend money to and transact other business with the company. As to each loan or transaction, the rights and obligations of the member are the same as those of a person who is not a member, subject to other applicable law. (g) This section applies to a person winding up the limited liability company's business as the personal or legal representative of the last surviving member as if the person were a member. (h) In a manager-managed company: (1) A member who is not also a manager owes no duties to the company or to the other members solely by reason of being a member; (2) A manager is held to the same standards of conduct prescribed for members in subsections (b) through (f); (3) A member who pursuant to the operating agreement exercises some or all of the rights of a manager in the management and conduct of the company's business is held to the standards of conduct in subsections (b) through (f) to the extent that the member exercises the managerial authority vested in a manager by this Act; and (4) A manager is relieved of liability imposed by law for violation of the standards prescribed by subsections (b) through (f) to the extent of the managerial authority delegated to the members by the operating agreement. SECTION 410. (a) A member may maintain an action against a limited liability company or another member for legal or equitable relief, with or without an accounting as to the company's business, to enforce: (1) The member's rights under the operating agreement; (2) The member's rights under this Act; and (3) The rights and otherwise protect the interests of the member, including rights and interests arising independently of the member's relationship to the company. (b) The accrual, and any time limited for the assertion, of a right of action for a remedy under this section is governed by other law. A right to an accounting upon a dissolution and winding up does not revive a claim barred by law. SECTION 501. (a) A member is not a co-owner of, and has no transferable interest in, property of a limited liability company. (b) A distributional interest in a limited liability company is personal property and, subject to sections 502 and 503, may be transferred in whole or in part. (c) An operating agreement may provide that a distributional interest may be evidenced by a certificate of the interest issued by the limited liability company and, subject to section 503, may also provide for the transfer of any interest represented by the certificate. SECTION 502. A transfer of a distributional interest does not entitle the transferee to become or to exercise any rights of a member. A transfer entitles the transferee to receive, to the extent transferred, only the distributions to which the transferor would be entitled. SECTION 503. (a) A transferee of a distributional interest may become a member of a limited liability company if and to the extent that the transferor gives the transferee the right in accordance with authority described in the operating agreement or all other members consent. (b) A transferee who has become a member, to the extent transferred, has the rights and powers, and is subject to the restrictions and liabilities, of a member under the operating agreement of a limited liability company and this Act. A transferee who becomes a member also is liable for the transferor member's obligations to make contributions under section 402 and for obligations under section 407 to return unlawful distributions, but the transferee is not obligated for the transferor member's liabilities unknown to the transferee at the time the transferee becomes a member. (c) Whether or not a transferee of a distributional interest becomes a member under subsection (a), the transferor is not released from liability to the limited liability company under the operating agreement or this Act. (d) A transferee who does not become a member is not entitled to participate in the management or conduct of the limited liability company's business, require access to information concerning the company's transactions, or inspect or copy any of the company's records. (e) A transferee who does not become a member is entitled to: (1) Receive, in accordance with the transfer, distributions to which the transferor would otherwise be entitled; (2) Receive, upon dissolution and winding up of the limited liability company's business: (i) In accordance with the transfer, the net amount otherwise distributable to the transferor; (ii) A statement of account only from the date of the latest statement of account agreed to by all the members; (3) Seek under section 801(a)(5) a judicial determination that it is equitable to dissolve and wind up the company's business. (f) A limited liability company need not give effect to a transfer until it has notice of the transfer. SECTION 504. (a) On application by a judgment creditor of a member of a limited liability company or of a member's transferee, a court having jurisdiction may charge the distributional interest of the judgment debtor to satisfy the judgment. The court may appoint a receiver of the share of the distributions due or to become due to the judgment debtor and make all other orders, directions, accounts, and inquiries the judgment debtor might have made or which the circumstances may require to give effect to the charging order. (b) A charging order constitutes a lien on the judgment debtor's distributional interest. The court may order a foreclosure of a lien on a distributional interest subject to the charging order at any time. A purchaser at the foreclosure sale has the rights of a transferee. (c) At any time before foreclosure, a distributional interest in a limited liability company which is charged may be redeemed: (1) By the judgment debtor; (2) With property other than the company's property, by one or more of the other members; or (3) With the company's property, but only if permitted by the operating agreement. (d) This Act does not affect a member's right under exemption laws with respect to the member's distributional interest in a limited liability company. (e) This section provides the exclusive remedy by which a judgment creditor of a member or a transferee may satisfy a judgment out of the judgment debtor's distributional interest in a limited liability company. SECTION 601. A member is dissociated from a limited liability company upon the occurrence of any of the following events: (1) The company's having notice of the member's express will to withdraw upon the date of notice or on a later date specified by the member; (2) An event agreed to in the operating agreement as causing the member's dissociation; (3) Upon transfer of all of a member's distributional interest, other than a transfer for security purposes or a court order charging the member's distributional interest which has not been foreclosed; (4) The member's expulsion pursuant to the operating agreement; (5) The member's expulsion by unanimous vote of the other members if: (i) It is unlawful to carry on the company's business with the member; (ii) There has been a transfer of substantially all of the member's distributional interest, other than a transfer for security purposes or a court order charging the member's distributional interest which has not been foreclosed; (iii) Within ninety days after the company notifies a corporate member that it will be expelled because it has filed a certificate of dissolution or the equivalent, its charter has been revoked, or its right to conduct business has been suspended by the jurisdiction of its incorporation, the member fails to obtain a revocation of the certificate of dissolution or a reinstatement of its charter or its right to conduct business; or (iv) A partnership or a limited liability company that is a member has been dissolved and its business is being wound up; (6) On application by the company or another member, the member's expulsion by judicial determination because the member: (i) Engaged in wrongful conduct that adversely and materially affected the company's business; (ii) Willfully or persistently committed a material breach of the operating agreement or of a duty owed to the company or the other members under section 409; or (iii) Engaged in conduct relating to the company's business which makes it not reasonably practicable to carry on the business with the member; (7) The member's: (i) Becoming a debtor in bankruptcy; (ii) Executing an assignment for the benefit of creditors; (iii) Seeking, consenting to, or acquiescing in the appointment of a trustee, receiver, or liquidator of the member or of all or substantially all of the member's property; or (iv) Failing, within ninety days after the appointment, to have vacated or stayed the appointment of a trustee, receiver, or liquidator of the member or of all or substantially all of the member's property obtained without the member's consent or acquiescence, or failing within ninety days after the expiration of a stay to have the appointment vacated; (8) In the case of a member who is an individual: (i) The member's death; (ii) The appointment of a guardian or general conservator for the member; or (iii) A judicial determination that the member has otherwise become incapable of performing the member's duties under the operating agreement; (9) In the case of a member that is a trust or is acting as a member by virtue of being a trustee of a trust, distribution of the trust's entire rights to receive distributions from the company, but not merely by reason of the substitution of a successor trustee; (10) In the case of a member that is an estate or is acting as a member by virtue of being a personal representative of an estate, distribution of the estate's entire rights to receive distributions from the company, but not merely the substitution of a successor personal representative; or (11) Termination of the existence of a member if the member is not an individual, estate, or trust other than a business trust. SECTION 602. (a) Unless otherwise provided in the operating agreement, a member has the power to dissociate from a limited liability company at any time, rightfully or wrongfully, by express will pursuant to section 601(1). (b) If the operating agreement has not eliminated a member's power to dissociate, the member's dissociation from a limited liability company is wrongful only if: (1) It is in breach of an express provision of the agreement; or (2) Before the expiration of the term specified in the articles of organization if any: (i) The member withdraws by express will; (ii) The member is expelled by judicial determination under section 601(6); (iii) The member is dissociated by becoming a debtor in bankruptcy; or (iv) In the case of a member who is not an individual, trust other than a business trust, or estate, the member is expelled or otherwise dissociated because it willfully dissolved or terminated its existence. (c) A member who wrongfully dissociates from a limited liability company is liable to the company and to the other members for damages caused by the dissociation. The liability is in addition to any other obligation of the member to the company or to the other members. SECTION 603. (a) A limited liability company does not dissolve and wind up its business as result of a member's dissociation. (b) Upon a member's dissociation from a limited liability company: (1) The member's right to participate in the management and conduct of the company's business terminates, except as otherwise provided in section 803, and the member ceases to be a member and is treated the same as a transferee of a member; (2) The member's duty of loyalty under section 409(b)(3) terminates; and (3) The member's duty of loyalty under section 409(b)(1) and (2) and duty of care under section 409(c) continue only with regard to matters arising and events occurring before the member's dissociation. SECTION 604. For two years after a member dissociates without the dissociation resulting in a dissolution and winding up of a limited liability company's business, the company, including a surviving company under Article 9, is bound by an act of the dissociated member which would have bound the company under section 301 before dissociation only if at the time of entering into the transaction the other party: (1) Reasonably believed that the dissociated member was then a member; (2) Did not have notice of the member's dissociation; and (3) Is not deemed to have had notice under section 605. SECTION 605. (a) A dissociated member or a limited liability company may file in the office of the secretary of state a statement of dissociation stating the name of the company and that the member is dissociated from the company. If the statement is filed by a dissociated member a copy of the statement must also be delivered to the company by the dissociated member. (b) For the purposes of sections 301 and 604, a person not a member is deemed to have notice of the dissociation ninety days after the statement of dissociation is filed. SECTION 801. (a) A limited liability company is dissolved, and its business must be wound up, upon the occurrence of any of the following events: (1) An event specified in the operating agreement; (2) Consent of the number or percentage of members specified in the operating agreement; (3) An event that makes it unlawful for all or substantially all of the business of the company to be continued, but any cure of illegality within ninety days after notice to the company of the event is effective retroactively to the date of the event for purposes of this section; (4) On application by a member or a dissociated member, upon entry of a judicial decree that: (i) The economic purpose of the company is likely to be unreasonably frustrated; (ii) Another member has engaged in conduct relating to the company's business that makes it not reasonably practicable to carry on the company's business with that member; (iii) It is not otherwise reasonably practicable to carry on the company's business in conformity with the articles of organization and the operating agreement; or (iv) The managers or members in control of the company have acted, are acting, or will act in a manner that is illegal, oppressive, fraudulent, or unfairly prejudicial to the petitioner; or (5) On application by a transferee of a member's interest, a judicial determination that it is equitable to wind up the company's business after the expiration of a specified duration or event, if the company was for a specified duration at the time the applicant became a transferee by member dissociation, transfer, or entry of a charging order that gave rise to the transfer. SECTION 802. (a) Subject to subsection (b), a limited liability company continues after dissolution only for the purpose of winding up its business. (b) At any time after the dissolution of a limited liability company and before the winding up of its business is completed, the members may unanimously waive the right to have the company's business wound up and the company terminated. In that case: (1) The limited liability company resumes carrying on its business as if dissolution had never occurred and any liability incurred by the company or a member after the dissolution and before the waiver is determined as if the dissolution had never occurred; and (2) The rights of a third party accruing as a result of the dissolution, under section 804(a), or arising out of conduct in reliance on the dissolution before the third party knew or received a notification of the waiver are not adversely affected. SECTION 803. (a) After dissolution, a member who has not wrongfully dissociated may participate in winding up a limited liability company's business, but on application of any member, member's legal representative, or transferee, the circuit court, for good cause shown, may order judicial supervision of the winding up. (b) A legal representative of the last surviving member may wind up a limited liability company's business. (c) A person winding up a limited liability company's business may preserve the company's business or property as a going concern for a reasonable time, prosecute and defend actions and proceedings, whether civil, criminal, or administrative, settle and close the company's business, dispose of and transfer the company's property, discharge the company's liabilities, distribute the assets of the company pursuant to section 806, settle disputes by mediation or arbitration, and perform other necessary acts. SECTION 804. (a) A limited liability company is bound by a member's or manager's act after dissolution that: (1) Is appropriate for winding up the company's business; or (2) Would have bound the company under section 301 before dissolution, if the other party to the transaction did not have notice of the dissolution. (b) A member or manager who, with knowledge of the dissolution, subjects a limited liability company to liability by an act that is not appropriate for winding up the company's business is liable to the company for any damage caused to the company arising from the liability. SECTION 805. (a) At any time after dissolution and winding up, a limited liability company may terminate its existence by filing with the secretary of state articles of termination stating: (1) The name of the company; (2) The date of the dissolution; and (3) That the company's business has been wound up and the legal existence of the company has been terminated. (b) The existence of a limited liability company is terminated upon the filing of the articles of termination, or upon a later effective date, if specified in the articles of termination. SECTION 806. (a) In winding up a limited liability company's business, the assets of the company must be applied to discharge its obligations to creditors, including members who are creditors. Any surplus must be applied to pay in money the net amount distributable to members in accordance with their right to distributions under subsection (b). (b) Each member is entitled to a distribution upon the winding up of the limited liability company's business consisting of a return of all contributions which have not previously been returned and a distribution of any remainder in equal shares. SECTION 807. (a) A dissolved limited liability company may dispose of the known claims against it by following the procedure described in this section. (b) A dissolved limited liability company shall notify its known claimants in writing of the dissolution. The notice must: (1) Specify the information required to be included in a claim; (2) Provide a mailing address where the claim is to be sent; (3) State the deadline for receipt of the claim, which may not be less than one hundred twenty days after the date the written notice is received by the claimant; and (4) State that the claim will be barred if not received by the deadline. (c) A claim against a dissolved limited liability company is barred if the requirements of subsection (b) are met, and: (1) The claim is not received by the specified deadline; or (2) In the case of a claim that is timely received but rejected by the dissolved company, the claimant does not commence a proceeding to enforce the claim within ninety days after the receipt of the notice of the rejection. (d) For purposes of this section, claim does not include a contingent liability or a claim based on an event occurring after the effective date of dissolution. SECTION 808. (a) A dissolved limited liability company may publish notice of its dissolution and request persons having claims against the company to present them in accordance with the notice. (b) The notice must: (1) Be published at least once in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the dissolved limited liability company's principal office is located or, if none in this state, in which its registered office is or was last located; (2) Describe the information required to be contained in a claim and provide a mailing address where the claim is to be sent; and (3) State that a claim against the limited liability company is barred unless a proceeding to enforce the claim is commenced within five years after publication of the notice.

SECTION 809. The secretary of state may commence a proceeding to dissolve a limited liability company administratively if the company does not: (1) Pay any fees, taxes, or penalties imposed by this Act or other law within sixty days after they are due; or (2) Deliver its annual report to the secretary of state within sixty days after it is due. SECTION 810. (a) If the secretary of state determines that a ground exists for administratively dissolving a limited liability company, the secretary of state shall enter a record of the determination and serve the company with a copy of the record. (b) If the company does not correct each ground for dissolution or demonstrate to the reasonable satisfaction of the secretary of state that each ground determined by the secretary of state does not exist within sixty days after service of the notice, the secretary of state shall administratively dissolve the company by signing a certification of the dissolution that recites the ground for dissolution and its effective date. The secretary of state shall file the original of the certificate and serve the company with a copy of the certificate. (c) A company administratively dissolved continues its existence but may carry on only business necessary to wind up and liquidate its business and affairs under section 802 and to notify claimants under sections 807 and 808.

(c) When reinstatement is effective, it relates back to and takes effect as of the effective date of the administrative dissolution and the company may resume its business as if the administrative dissolution had never occurred.

(c) The court may summarily order the secretary of state to reinstate the dissolved company or may take other action the court considers appropriate.

Upon receipt of process, the secretary of state shall send a copy of the process by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, to the surviving entity at the address set forth in the articles of merger. Service is effected under this subsection at the earliest of: (1) The date the company receives the process, notice, or demand; (2) The date shown on the return receipt, if signed on behalf of the company; or (3) Five days after its deposit in the mail, if mailed postpaid and correctly addressed. (c) A member of the surviving limited liability company is liable for all obligations of a party to the merger for which the member was personally liable before the merger. (d) Unless otherwise agreed, a merger of a limited liability company that is not the surviving entity in the merger does not require the limited liability company to wind up its business under this Act or pay its liabilities and distribute its assets pursuant to this Act. (e) Articles of merger serve as articles of dissolution for a limited liability company that is not the surviving entity in the merger. SECTION 907. This article does not preclude an entity from being converted or merged under other law. SECTION 1001.
