As used in this section, the term, evaluate, does not include evaluations by peers or subordinates. This section does not apply to: (1) An employment relationship or contract entered into before July 1, 2019; (2) An employment relationship or contract entered into before the person assumed the supervisory capacity; or (3) Any temporary work arrangement necessary to meet a critical and urgent agency need.

Any resident of this state may bring a declaratory judgment action under chapter 21-24 in any circuit court against any person in violation of this section. If the resident prevails, the state official against whom the action was brought shall forfeit the office to which the official was elected or appointed and an employee against whom an action was brought shall be discharged."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 9666, "action_date": "2019-01-08T12:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 51490, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/51490.pdf", "status_text": "First read in Senate and referred to", "journal_page": 28, "committee_id_action": 409, "committee_id_assigned": 412, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 9666, "action_date": "2019-01-23T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 51783, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/51783.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 412, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 9666, "action_date": "2019-01-23T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 52071, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/52071.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to the 41st legislative day", "journal_page": 150, "committee_id_action": 412, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 27384, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [1441, 1588, 1604, 1601, 1603, 1595, 1597, 1585, 1606]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/9666"}
