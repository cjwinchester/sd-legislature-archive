Section 5. That \u00a7 34-23A-56 be amended to read: 34-23A-56. No surgical or medical abortion may be scheduled except by a licensed physician and only after the physician physically and personally meets with the pregnant mother, consults with her, and performs an assessment of her medical and personal circumstances. Only after the physician completes the consultation and assessment complying with the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 34-23A-53 to 34-23A-62, inclusive, may the physician schedule a surgical or medical abortion, but in no instance may the physician schedule such surgical or medical abortion to take place in less than seventy-two hours from the completion of such consultation and assessment except in a medical emergency as set forth in \u00a7 34-23A-10.1 and subdivision 34-23A-1(5) \u00a7 34-23A-1. No Saturday, Sunday, or annually recurring holiday, as specifically named in \u00a7 1-5-1, may be included or counted in the calculation of the seventy-two hour minimum time period between the initial physician consultation and assessment and the time of the scheduled abortion procedure. No physician may have the pregnant mother sign a consent for the abortion on the day of this initial consultation and no physician, abortion provider, hospital, or clinic, at which the physician performs an abortion, may accept payment for an abortion until a consent is signed after full compliance with the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 34-23A-53 to 34-23A-62, inclusive.

During the initial consultation between the physician and the pregnant mother, prior to scheduling a surgical or medical abortion, the physician shall: (1) Do an assessment of the pregnant mother's circumstances to make a reasonable determination whether the pregnant mother's decision to submit to an abortion is the result of any coercion or pressure from other persons. In conducting that assessment, the physician shall obtain from the pregnant mother the age or approximate age of the father of the unborn child, and the physician shall consider whether any disparity in age between the mother and father is a factor when determining whether the pregnant mother has been subjected to pressure, undue influence, or coercion; (2) Provide the written disclosure required by subdivision 34-23A-10.1(1) and discuss them with her to determine that she understands them; (3) Provide the pregnant mother with the names, addresses, and telephone numbers of all pregnancy help centers that are registered with the South Dakota Department of Health pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 34-23A-53 to 34-23A-62, inclusive, and provide her with written instructions that set forth the following: (a) That prior to the day of any scheduled abortion the pregnant mother must have a consultation at a pregnancy help center at which the pregnancy help center shall inform her about what education, counseling, and other assistance is available to help the pregnant mother keep and care for her child, and have a private interview to discuss her circumstances that may subject her decision to coercion; (b) That prior to signing a consent to an abortion, the physician shall first obtain from the pregnant mother, a written statement that she obtained a consultation with a pregnancy help center, which sets forth the name and address of the pregnancy help center, the date and time of the consultation, and the name of the counselor at the pregnancy help center with whom she consulted; (4) Conduct an assessment of the pregnant mother's health and circumstances to determine if any of the following preexisting risk factors associated with adverse psychological outcomes following an abortion are present in her case: (a) Coercion; (b) Pressure from others to have an abortion; (c) The pregnant mother views an abortion to be in conflict with her personal or religious values; (d) The pregnant mother is ambivalent about her decision to have an abortion, or finds the decision of whether to have an abortion difficult and she has a high degree of decisional distress; (e) That the pregnant mother has a commitment to the pregnancy or prefers to carry the child to term; (f) The pregnant mother has a medical history that includes a pre-abortion mental health or psychiatric problem; and (g) The pregnant mother is twenty-two years old or younger. The physician making the assessment shall record in the pregnant mother's medical records, on a form created for such purpose, each of the risk factors associated with adverse psychological outcomes following an abortion listed in this subdivision that are present in her case and which are not present in her case; (4A) Inquire into whether the pregnant mother knows the sex of her unborn child and if so, whether the mother is seeking an abortion due to the sex of the unborn child. (5) The physician shall identify for the pregnant mother and explain each of the risk factors associated with adverse psychological outcomes following an abortion listed in subdivision (4) which are present in her case; (6) The physician shall advise the pregnant mother of each risk factor associated with adverse psychological outcomes following an abortion listed in subdivision 34-23A-56(4) which the physician determines are present in her case and shall discuss with the pregnant mother, in such a manner and detail as is appropriate, so that the physician can certify that the physician has made a reasonable determination that the pregnant mother understands the information imparted, all material information about the risk of adverse psychological outcomes known to be associated with each of the risk factors found to be present; (7) In the event that no risk factor is determined to be present, the physician shall include in the patient's records a statement that the physician has discussed the information required by the other parts of this section and that the physician has made a reasonable determination that the mother understands the information in question; (8) Records of the assessments, forms, disclosures, and instructions performed and given pursuant to this section shall be prepared by the physician and maintained as a permanent part of the pregnant mother's medical records.

Any requests shall be evidenced in writing signed by the pregnant mother; (3) The pregnancy help center is under no obligation to communicate with the abortion provider in any way, and is under no obligation to submit any written or other form of confirmation that the pregnant mother consulted with the pregnancy help center. The pregnancy help center may voluntarily provide a written statement of assessment to the abortion provider, whose name the woman shall give to the pregnancy help center, if the pregnancy help center obtains information that indicates that the pregnant mother has been subjected to coercion or that her decision to consider an abortion is otherwise not voluntary or not informed. The physician shall make the physician's own independent determination whether or not a pregnant mother's consent to have an abortion is voluntary, uncoerced, and informed before having the pregnant mother sign a consent to an abortion. The physician shall review and consider any information provided by the pregnancy help center as one source of information, which in no way binds the physician, who shall make an independent determination consistent with the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 34-23A-53 to 34-23A-59.2, inclusive, the common law requirements, and accepted medical standards; (4) Any written statement or summary of assessment prepared by the pregnancy help center as a result of counseling of a pregnant mother as a result of the procedures created by \u00a7\u00a7 34-23A-53 to 34-23A-59.2, inclusive, may be forwarded by the pregnancy help center, in its discretion, to the abortion physician. If forwarded to the physician, the written statement or summary of assessment shall be maintained as a permanent part of the pregnant mother's medical records. Other than forwarding such documents to the abortion physician, no information obtained by the pregnancy help center from the pregnant mother may be released, without the written signed consent of the pregnant mother or unless the release is in accordance with federal, state, or local law; (5) Commencing on September 1, 2016, the counseling authorized pursuant to this section shall be conducted in accordance with the Uniform Policy and Procedures Guidelines developed and promulgated by the South Dakota Association of Registered Pregnancy Help Centers and adopted in 2015. Nothing in \u00a7\u00a7 34-23A-53 to 34-23A-59.2, inclusive, may be construed to impose any liability upon a pregnancy help center. However, the failure of a pregnancy help center to comply with the conditions of \u00a7 34-23A-58.1, 34-23A-59.1 or this section for being authorized to provide the pregnancy help center counseling, if uncorrected, may result in the Department of Health removing the pregnancy help center from the state's registry of pregnancy help centers. Section 7. That \u00a7 58-17-147 be amended to read: 58-17-147. Pursuant to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Pub. L.
