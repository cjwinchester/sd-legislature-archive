The Game, Fish and Parks Commission may promulgate rules in accordance with chapter 1-26 to authorize the department to issue up to two thousand five hundred fall three-day temporary nonresident waterfowl licenses, up to two thousand early fall Canada goose temporary nonresident licenses, and a number of spring snow goose temporary nonresident licenses to be determined by the department, and to establish the fee therefor, validity of the licenses issued, types of waterfowl to be hunted, and areas in which hunting is permitted.
