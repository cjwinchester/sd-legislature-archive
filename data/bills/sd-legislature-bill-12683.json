Qualifying existing Creditable coverage does not include individual coverage. Section 18. That \u00a7 58-18B-27 be amended to read as follows: 58-18B-27.

The basic benefit plan shall have a lifetime maximum benefit which is not in excess of five hundred thousand dollars. At least every five years, the Legislature shall study the necessity for adjusting the lifetime maximum benefit. The basic and standard benefit plans are subject to the requirements of \u00a7 \u00a7 58-17-53 to 58-17-56, inclusive, 58-18-7.1 to 58-18-7.16, inclusive, and 58-18-31 to 58-18-39, inclusive.

The director shall also promulgate rules regulating the solicitation and sale of multiple employer trusts and multiple employer welfare arrangements. In considering the promulgation of rules pursuant to this section, the director shall take into consideration, the status of the small employer market, the impact such rules would have on the availability of health insurance and the impact such rules may have on the fair marketing of health insurance in this state. The rules may cover: (1) Suitability and eligibility of insureds for coverage; (2) Method of premium payments; (3) Minimum stop loss amounts including specific and aggregate attachment points ; (4) Contractual obligations and policy provisions of carriers; (5) Form filing requirements, including those for approval and disapproval; (6) Reporting and recordkeeping requirements; (7) Definition of terms; and (8) Eligibility of insurers.

If any federal standards are in place which would require additional steps to meet those standards beyond what is required by this chapter, the director may promulgate rules to require the offering of health insurance plans, in addition to those specifically required by \u00a7 \u00a7 58-18B-19 and 58-18B-20, the underwriting criteria that may be utilized for such health insurance plans, and other requirements related to the availability of health insurance to individuals in this state in order to minimally meet the federal standards. Section 22. That \u00a7 58-18B-37 be amended to read as follows: 58-18B-37. Each small employer carrier shall actively market health benefit plan coverage, including the basic and standard health benefit plans, to eligible small employers in the state. If a small employer carrier denies coverage to a small employer on the basis of the health status or claims experience of the small employer or its employees or dependents, the small employer carrier shall offer the small employer the opportunity to purchase a basic health benefit plan and a standard health benefit plan. Nothing in this chapter prohibits a carrier from offering other health benefit plans on an underwritten basis. A network plan is not required to offer coverage to an employer whose employees do no work or reside within the carrier's established geographic service. A network plan may deny coverage to employers if it demonstrates it does not have the capacity to deliver services adequately to enrollees of any additional groups because of its obligations to existing group contract holders and enrollees, and if it is applying this denial of coverage uniformly to all employers without regard to the claims experience of those employers, and their employees and their dependents, or any health status-related factor relating to the employees and dependents. Section 23. That \u00a7 58-18B-48 be amended to read as follows: 58-18B-48.

The self-funded nonfederal government employer plans are subject to the provisions of \u00a7 \u00a7 58-18-42 to 58-18-49, inclusive, whether or not it is a single employer plan, a pooled arrangement, a cooperative, through a joint powers agreement, or other similar mechanism for providing health coverage. Section 25. That chapter 58-18 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: If any federal standards are in place which require additional steps to meet those standards beyond what is required by this chapter, the director may promulgate rules pursuant to chapter 1-26 to require the offering of health insurance plans, the underwriting criteria that may be utilized for such health insurance plans, the type and scope of preexisting waiting periods and creditable coverage, the standards for nonrenewability of coverage, and other requirements related to the availability of health insurance to employers and their employees and dependents in this state in order to minimally meet the federal standards.
