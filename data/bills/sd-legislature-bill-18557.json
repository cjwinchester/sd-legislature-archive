No person in the business of transporting goods may knowingly or intentionally transport any alcoholic beverage, from an out-of-state location of a person in the business of selling alcoholic beverages, directly to a person in this state who is not a wholesaler. For a first violation of this section, the Department of Revenue and Regulation shall notify, by certified mail, the violator and order that person to cease and desist any shipment of alcoholic beverages in violation of this section. A second violation of this section is a Class 1 misdemeanor, and a third and subsequent violation is a Class 6 felony. Any alcoholic beverage transported in violation of this section and any vehicle used in violation of this section are subject to confiscation as contraband. Section 2. That chapter 35-12A be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Section 1 of this Act does not apply to a transaction in which a person twenty-one years of age or older who imports or transports into this state no more than twelve cases of wine per person per calendar year for personal use and not for resale from a person holding a valid manufacturer's or retailer's license issued by the state of its domicile. A case may contain no more than nine liters (2.38 gallons) or less per case in any one shipment. Every package of wine shipped directly to an individual in this state shall be labeled with conspicuous words \"SIGNATURE OF PERSON AGE 21 OR OLDER REQUIRED FOR DELIVERY.\" A shipper shall obtain the signature of a person twenty-one years of age or older before delivering any wine shipped directly to any person in this state. It is a Class 2 misdemeanor for any person to receive wine in excess of the amounts specified in this section. It is a Class 2 misdemeanor for any person to resell or attempt to resell any wine obtained pursuant to this section. Section 3. That chapter 35-12A be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Any manufacturer or retailer selling or shipping wine under this Act shall obtain a direct shipping permit from the department and pay an annual fee of fifty dollars within thirty days of making the first shipment.

Upon determination by the department that an illegal sale or shipment of alcoholic beverages has been made to a consumer in this state by either a manufacturer or retailer of alcoholic beverages, the department may notify both the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms of the United States Department of the Treasury and the licensing authority for the state in which the manufacturer or retailer is domiciled that a state law pertaining to the regulation of alcoholic beverages has been violated and may request those agencies to take appropriate action. The Department of Revenue and Regulation shall promulgate rules pursuant to chapter 1-26 to provide for the reporting and tracking of information related to the sale of wine under this Act and to prescribe forms for the implementation of this Act.

That \u00a7 35-12A-1 be repealed. 35-12A-1. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any person who is at least twenty-one years of age may purchase and receive wine from another state as provided in this section if the wine is not in distribution in this state and the wine comes from a winery that is located in a state that affords South Dakota wineries an equal reciprocal shipping privilege, or a winery located in South Dakota. The person shall place an order with a licensee as defined in subdivision 35-4-2(3) or (5).

The licensee shall collect the total amount due from the customer before ordering the wine through the wholesaler. After receiving the order for the wine from the licensed retailer the wholesaler shall arrange for the wine to be shipped directly to the licensee who placed the order for the purchaser. Wine purchased pursuant to this chapter may only be delivered and received by the purchaser from a licensee as defined in subdivision 35-4-2(3) or (5). Section 6.

It is a Class 2 misdemeanor for any person to receive more than twelve cases of wine during a calendar year in violation of this chapter. It is a Class 2 misdemeanor for any person to resell or attempt to resell any wine obtained pursuant to this chapter.
