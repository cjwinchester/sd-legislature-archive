BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 13-6-97 be amended to read as follows: 13-6-97. Any school district that has a fall enrollment, as defined in \u00a7 13-13-10.1, of less than one hundred and is not a sparse school district, as defined in \u00a7 13-13-78, shall reorganize with another school district or school districts to create a newly reorganized school district with a fall enrollment of one hundred or greater. Any school district that is not sparse and has a fall enrollment of one hundred or less on July 1, 2007, shall prepare a plan for reorganization by June 30, 2009. After July 1, 2007, if the fall enrollment of any school district that is not sparse falls to one hundred or below, that school district shall prepare a plan for reorganization within two years. If any such district fails to prepare a plan for reorganization by the deadline, the Board of Education shall prepare a reorganization plan for the district. However, the provisions of this section do not apply to any school district that contracts with a school district in another state pursuant to \u00a7 13-15-11 to provide for the education of children in grades seven through twelve who reside within the district, that receives no foundation program state aid distributed pursuant to chapter 13-13, and that is located at least twenty-five miles from the nearest high school in an adjoining school district in the state. In addition, the provisions of this section do not apply to any school district that contracts with a school district in another state pursuant to \u00a7 13-15- 11 to provide for the education of all its resident children if the schools in the school district in the other state that the resident children attend are no more than fifteen miles from the border of the resident school district."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 195, "action_date": "2008-01-16T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 1255, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/1255.pdf", "status_text": "First read in Senate and referred to", "journal_page": 132, "committee_id_action": 28, "committee_id_assigned": 3, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 195, "action_date": "2008-01-22T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 1321, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/1321.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 3, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 195, "action_date": "2008-01-22T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 1481, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/1481.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass", "journal_page": 173, "committee_id_action": 3, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 406, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [598, 562, 613, 577, 539, 588], "Excused": [569]}}, {"bill_id": 195, "action_date": "2008-01-23T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 1712, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/1712.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass", "journal_page": 196, "committee_id_action": 28, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 493, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [557, 569], "Yea": [576, 621, 604, 553, 596, 560, 590, 598, 545, 592, 530, 601, 567, 535, 533, 582, 562, 622, 584, 573, 618, 610, 629, 613, 632, 577, 588, 539, 627, 548, 550, 541, 607]}}, {"bill_id": 195, "action_date": "2008-01-24T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 1819, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/1819.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 249, "committee_id_action": 27, "committee_id_assigned": 16, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 195, "action_date": "2008-02-21T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 3414, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/3414.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 16, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 195, "action_date": "2008-02-21T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 3675, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/3675.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass", "journal_page": 685, "committee_id_action": 16, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 2341, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [609, 608, 534, 595, 620, 537, 566, 611], "Nay": [625, 580, 630, 599, 559, 564, 565]}}, {"bill_id": 195, "action_date": "2008-02-22T13:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 3824, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/3824.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to another day", "journal_page": 702, "committee_id_action": 27, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 195, "action_date": "2008-02-25T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 3927, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/3927.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass", "journal_page": 734, "committee_id_action": 27, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "F", "vote": {"vote_id": 2526, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [602, 609, 593, 570, 532, 608, 534, 555, 568, 552, 575, 572, 595, 529, 594, 620, 585, 633, 543, 571, 544, 537, 536, 578, 612, 551, 531, 540, 566, 611, 564], "Nay": [579, 614, 625, 586, 597, 623, 574, 542, 580, 631, 565, 616, 556, 589, 558, 605, 628, 630, 581, 546, 599, 617, 554, 547, 583, 538, 603, 615, 600, 563, 549, 619, 626, 606, 587, 559, 561, 591], "Excused": [624]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/195"}
