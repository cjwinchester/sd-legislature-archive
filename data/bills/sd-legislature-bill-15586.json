Approval to enter into an agreement or issue capital outlay certificates to which \u00a7 13-16-6.3 applies is subject to a referendum if five percent of the registered voters, based upon the total number of registered voters at the last preceding general election, petition, within twenty days thereafter, to have the question of approval or disapproval of the agreement or issue of capital outlay certificates or the lease-purchase agreement placed upon the ballot at the next regular election or at a special election called for that purpose. The business manager shall give notice of the fact that the question will be on the ballot at a regular or special election as provided by law for school elections and prepare official ballots therefor according to the provisions of this Title relating to elections and the issue shall be decided by a majority sixty percent of those voting thereon. Section 9. That chapter 13-16 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Notwithstanding the provisions of \u00a7 13-16-26, no school district may transfer more than thirty thousand dollars in any year from the general fund to the capital outlay fund. Any school district whose average teacher salary is less than the statewide average teacher salary, as determined by the Department of Education and Cultural Affairs, in the 1999-2000 school year, may not transfer any money from the general fund to the capital outlay fund. Any school district that transferred money in excess of thirty thousand dollars from the general fund to the capital outlay fund after June 30, 1999, but before July 1, 2000, shall transfer such money back to the general fund. Section 10. That chapter 13-16 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: The school board of any school district with an ending general fund balance that exceeds twenty-five percent of its general fund expenditures for the school fiscal year ending June 30, 1999, shall develop an educator salary enhancement plan. The plan shall cover multiple years and increase salaries for all employees of the school district, except for the salary of the chief administrator and business manager. The school board shall conduct at least two public hearings on the plan after having given notice by publication at least twice in its official newspaper at least ten days before each hearing. Each notice shall clearly state that the purpose of the hearing is to develop a plan to reduce the school district's general fund balance by providing higher pay to the school district employees. The first hearing shall be held at the beginning of the plan development process. The second hearing shall be held upon completion of the plan development process. The board may not adopt the plan before the second public hearing. The board shall also publish a summary and details of the plan twice in the district's official newspaper prior to the second public hearing. The educator salary enhancement plan shall include the criteria by which the school board will increase salaries. Such criteria shall, at a minimum, include employee performance, employee skills, employee knowledge, and student achievement. The criteria may include other factors such as the educational degrees earned or the number of credit hours attained, but they shall not outweigh employee performance, employee skills, employee knowledge, and student achievement in determining an individual's salary enhancement under this plan. The plan, upon approval by the local school board, shall be filed with the Department of Education and Cultural Affairs.
