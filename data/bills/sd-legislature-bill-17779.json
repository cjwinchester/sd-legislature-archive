BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 58-37A-39 be amended to read as follows: 58-37A-39. In addition to the provisions contained in this chapter, the following chapters and provisions of the South Dakota Code also apply to fraternal benefit societies, to the extent applicable and not in conflict with the express provisions of this chapter and the reasonable implications of this chapter: (1) Chapter 47-6; (2) Chapter 58-1; (3) Chapter 58-2, with the exception of \u00a7 58-2-29; (4) Chapter 58-3; (5) Chapter 58-4; (6) Chapter 58-5; (7) Section Sections 58-6-8 , 58-6-46, and 58-6-47 ; (8) Chapters 58-15, 58-17, 58-17A, 58-17B, and 58-18; (9) Chapter 58-29B; (10) Chapter 58-30; (11) Chapter 58-33; (12) Chapters 58-17C and 58-33A. Section 2. That \u00a7 58-37A-30 be repealed. 58-37A-30. If the director upon investigation finds that a domestic society: (1) Has exceeded its powers; (2) Has failed to comply with any provision of this chapter; (3) Is not fulfilling its contracts in good faith; (4) Has a membership of less than four hundred after an existence of one year or more; or (5) Is conducting business fraudulently or in a manner hazardous to its members, creditors, the public, or the business; the director shall notify the society of any deficiency and state in writing the reasons. The director shall at once issue a written notice to the society requiring that the deficiency be corrected. After this notice the society has a thirty-day period in which to comply with the director's request for correction, and if the society fails to comply the director shall notify the society of findings of noncompliance and require the society to show cause on a date named why it should not be enjoined from carrying on any business until the violation complained of is corrected, or why an action in quo warranto should not be commenced against the society. If on that date the society does not present good and sufficient reasons why it should not be enjoined or why this action should not be commenced, the director may present the facts relating to the injunction or this action to the attorney general who may commence an action to enjoin the society from transacting business or in quo warranto. The court shall notify the officers of the society of a hearing. If after a full hearing it appears that the society should be enjoined or liquidated or a receiver appointed, the court shall enter the necessary order. No society so enjoined may do business until: (1) The director finds that the violation complained of has been corrected; (2) The costs of the action have been paid by the society if the court finds that the society was in default as charged; (3) The court has dissolved its injunction; and (4) The director has reinstated the certificate of authority. If the court orders the society liquidated, it shall be enjoined from carrying on any further business, and the receiver of the society shall proceed at once to take possession of the books, papers, money, and other assets of the society and, under the direction of the court, proceed immediately to close the affairs of the society and to distribute its funds to those who are entitled. No action under this section may be recognized in any court of this state unless brought by the attorney general upon request of the director. If a receiver is to be appointed for a domestic society, the court shall appoint the director as the receiver. The provisions of this section relating to hearing by the director, action by the attorney general at the request of the director, hearing by the court, injunction and receivership are applicable to a society which voluntarily determines to discontinue business. Domestic societies are also subject to the applicable provisions of chapter 58-29B of this title which are not inconsistent with this section. Section 3. That \u00a7 58-37A-31 be repealed. 58-37A-31. If the director upon investigation finds that a foreign or alien society transacting or applying to transact business in this state: (1) Has exceeded its powers; (2) Has failed to comply with any of the provisions of this chapter; (3) Is not fulfilling its contracts in good faith; or (4) Is conducting its business fraudulently or in a manner hazardous to its members or creditors or the public; the director shall notify the society in writing of any deficiency and state in writing the reasons. The director shall at once issue a written order to the society requiring that the deficiency be corrected. After this order the society has a thirty-day period in which to comply with the director's order for correction, and if the society fails to comply, the director shall notify the society of his findings of noncompliance and require the society to show cause within ten days why its license should not be suspended, revoked, or refused. If on that date the society does not present good and sufficient reason why its authority to do business in this state should not be suspended, revoked, or refused, the director may suspend or refuse the license of the society to do business in this state until satisfactory evidence is furnished to the director that this suspension or refusal should be withdrawn or the director may revoke the authority of the society to do business in this state. Nothing contained in this section may be construed as preventing any society from continuing in good faith all contracts made in this state during the time the society was legally authorized to transact business. Section 4. That \u00a7 58-37A-32 be repealed. 58-37A-32. No application or petition for injunction against any domestic, foreign, or alien society, or lodge thereof, may be recognized in any court of this state unless made by the attorney general upon request of the director."}, {"bill_id": 17779, "bill_version_id": 96669, "bill_version": "Enrolled", "bill_version_date": "2003-02-06T09:03:41-06:00", "bill_text": ""}], "amendments": [],
