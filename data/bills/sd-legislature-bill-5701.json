BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. No person or entity may bring suit against another person for expressing their religious beliefs on the subject of sexual orientation. The Legislature finds that vocalizing the viewpoint that any specific sexual orientation is wrong or a sin is free speech protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution and by S.D. Const., Art. VI, \u00a7 5. Nothing in this Act allows speech designed to incite or threaten violence against any person or entity. Section 2. No person or entity may bring suit against a business for refusing to serve a person or couple based on sexual orientation. The Legislature finds that businesses are private and that their views on sexual orientation are protected to the same extent as the views of private citizens. No private business may be compelled to employ a person based on sexual orientation. The Legislature finds that any federal recognition of any specific sexual orientation as a protected class does not apply in South Dakota and may not be enforced within the geographical boundaries of South Dakota. The State of South Dakota finds that the Constitution of the United States does not grant the federal government of the United States the authority to govern speech relating to sexual orientation or the right of employers to determine whom they employ based upon sexual preference or orientation. Section 3. In any lawsuit brought in violation of section 1 or 2 of this Act, any judge presiding over the case shall: (1) Dismiss, with prejudice, any suit in which the defendant is charged for expressing the defendant's religious beliefs on the subject of sexual orientation or advocating negative views on any specific sexual orientation; (2) Determine the lawsuit to be frivolous; (3) Levy punitive damages on any person who brings such a suit an amount no less than two thousand dollars; and (4) Require the person pay court costs for both parties. Section 4. The Attorney General of South Dakota shall, upon request, defend any person or business brought into state or federal court in alleged violation of section 1 or 2 of this Act."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 5701, "action_date": "2014-01-30T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 29451, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/29451.pdf", "status_text": "First read in Senate and referred to", "journal_page": 169, "committee_id_action": 229, "committee_id_assigned": 210, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 5701, "action_date": "2014-02-18T08:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 30335, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/30335.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 210, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 5701, "action_date": "2014-02-18T08:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 30468, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/30468.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to the 41st legislative day", "journal_page": 340, "committee_id_action": 210, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 16147, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [434, 443, 432, 437, 446], "Nay": [526, 469]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/5701"}
