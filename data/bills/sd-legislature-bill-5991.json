WHEREAS, the United States of America takes in more legal immigrants than any nation in the world; and WHEREAS, it is impossible to honor the rich tradition of immigration and the rule of law upon which the American republic was founded unless existing immigration laws are ardently and equally enforced; and WHEREAS, according to estimates, eleven to twenty million people are present in the United States in violation of immigration laws; and WHEREAS, while more than twenty million Americans are under-employed or unemployed, illegal labor takes jobs away from American workers and lowers American wages; and WHEREAS, illegal employment and illegal immigration have a negative effect on America's poorest; and WHEREAS, the weight of the crisis lies with employers willing to hire cheaper black-market labor while legal immigrants and native-born Americans suffer the ravages of unemployment; and WHEREAS, official Congressional Budget Office data estimates that the recently passed Schumer-Rubio \"Gang of Eight\" legalization legislation known as S.744 would only reduce illegal immigration by thirty to fifty percent; and WHEREAS, the Congressional Budget Office also reports that the same Senate immigration bill would lower American wages; and WHEREAS, President Barack Obama declared in his January 27, 2010, State of the Union address, \"We should continue the work of fixing our broken immigration system_to secure our borders and enforce our laws, and ensure that everyone who plays by the rules can contribute to our economy and enrich our nation.\"; and WHEREAS, it is the responsibility of the federal government to enforce its borders, immigration laws, and employment laws to protect American citizens and the sovereignty of the United States of America; and WHEREAS, Congress instituted a \"one time\" legalization for illegal aliens in 1986 that promised to solve the illegal immigration crisis forever; and WHEREAS, the amnesty of 1986 proved beyond all doubt that rewarding illegal immigrants with amnesty is counter to the principles of justice and equal protection and only produces more illegal immigration; and WHEREAS, the enforcement of existing federal immigration laws including those regarding national security, immigration, and employment are necessary for the perpetuation of the sovereignty of this nation and the well-being of the American people: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the House of Representatives of the Eighty-Ninth Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the Senate concurring therein, that the South Dakota Legislature urges the President and the Congress of the United States to provide immediately for the security of our nation by controlling and securing our national borders and to resist all efforts to grant amnesty to illegal aliens who have violated the immigration laws of this nation and who are here illegally."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 5991, "action_date": "2014-02-06T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 29939, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/29939.pdf", "status_text": "First Reading", "journal_page": 315, "committee_id_action": 231, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 5991, "action_date": "2014-02-07T13:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 30024, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/30024.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to another day", "journal_page": 336, "committee_id_action": 231, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 5991, "action_date": "2014-02-12T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 30299, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/30299.pdf", "status_text": "Adopt Resolution", "journal_page": 392, "committee_id_action": 231, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 16026, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [528, 453, 522, 525, 467, 524, 489, 517, 519, 505, 425, 504, 481, 509, 501, 457, 523, 496, 466, 845, 499, 476, 521, 507, 487, 439, 500, 515, 511, 463, 518, 462, 485, 514, 450, 506, 430, 468, 461, 508, 460, 441], "Nay": [527, 433, 456, 449, 431, 455, 503, 477, 520, 479, 454, 458, 451, 442, 478, 423, 502, 497, 512, 484, 459, 464, 510, 513, 498, 516, 448], "Excused": [480]}}, {"bill_id": 5991, "action_date": "2014-02-13T13:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 30413, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/30413.pdf", "status_text": "First Reading", "journal_page": 329, "committee_id_action": 229, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 5991, "action_date": "2014-02-18T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 30512, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/30512.pdf", "status_text": "Concurred in Resolution", "journal_page": 345, "committee_id_action": 229, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "F", "vote": {"vote_id": 16167, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [469, 846, 495, 472, 470, 465, 443, 438, 526, 492, 491, 475, 440, 849, 494, 434], "Nay": [437, 444, 473, 447, 432, 847, 483, 452, 436, 424, 428, 435, 493, 474, 426, 446, 490, 486], "Excused": [429]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/5991"}
