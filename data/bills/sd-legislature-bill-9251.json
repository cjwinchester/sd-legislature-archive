WHEREAS, the EPA's current RVP waiver is limited to E10, a blend of 90 percent gasoline and 10 percent renewable biofuel; and WHEREAS, the current RVP rules effectively prohibit E15, a blend of 85 percent gasoline and 15 percent renewable biofuel, to be sold year-round in states that would otherwise permit year-round E15 sales; and WHEREAS, commodity surpluses and low prices in recent years have put America's farms in financial crisis and net farm income saw its deepest decline since the Great Depression during the period from 2013 to 2016; and WHEREAS, biofuels can reverse these troubling trends, balance commodity markets, and stabilize farm income; and WHEREAS, the EPA has an unprecedented opportunity to improve the livelihoods of farmers in South Dakota and across the heartland by eliminating unnecessary red tape and allowing E15 to be sold year-round; and WHEREAS, as consumers learn more, they are excited to have renewable, homegrown options to help clean the air and cut dependence on foreign oil; and WHEREAS, American drivers have surpassed three billion miles driven using E15; and WHEREAS, E15 is the most tested fuel in history and has been approved by the EPA for all vehicles 2001 and newer, nearly nine out of ten cars on the road today; and WHEREAS, today more than 1,300 locations across twenty-nine states are offering E15 to drivers and demand for E15 continues to grow; and WHEREAS, E15 saves drivers an average of five to ten cents per gallon, and lifting confusing regulations will allow fuel retailers to offer less expensive options at the gas pump year-round; and WHEREAS, during the summer months alone, E15 can reduce greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to taking 2.1 million vehicles off the road; and WHEREAS, E15 can lower the public health impacts from transportation emissions, including reducing risks associated with cancer and asthma; and WHEREAS, greater certainty in the marketplace will fuel innovation and investment in the next generation of advanced and cellulosic biofuels; and WHEREAS, biofuels displaced over 500 million barrels of imported oil in 2016, and giving consumers the freedom to choose homegrown biofuels reduces dependence on imported oil and helps grow jobs at home; and WHEREAS, full implementation of E15 will create another two billion bushels of corn demand for farmers, balancing commodities in the near-term and expanding opportunities for South Dakota agriculture and rural communities: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the House of Representatives of the Ninety- Third Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the Senate concurring therein, that the Legislature urges the United States Environmental Protection Agency to identify a regulatory path to extend a Reid vapor pressure waiver to E15."}, {"bill_id": 9251, "bill_version_id": 49948, "bill_version": "Enrolled", "bill_version_date": "2018-02-27T10:30:12.337-06:00", "bill_text": ""}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 9251, "action_date": "2018-02-21T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 49604, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/49604.pdf", "status_text": "First Reading", "journal_page": 523, "committee_id_action": 396, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 9251, "action_date": "2018-02-22T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 49713, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/49713.pdf", "status_text": "Adopt Resolution", "journal_page": 549, "committee_id_action": 396, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 26222, "president_vote": null, "Excused": [1313, 1241, 1260, 1259, 1254, 1285, 1253], "Yea": [1213, 1269, 1297, 1424, 1268, 1284, 1279, 1214, 1223, 1307, 1301, 1235, 1294, 1425, 1282, 1308, 1291, 1275, 1283, 1238, 1250, 1286, 1222, 1302, 1306, 1265, 1315, 1247, 1316, 1296, 1292, 1248, 1293, 1226, 1274, 1295, 1249, 1277, 1303, 1309, 1255, 1299, 1225, 1256, 1261, 1240, 1258, 1305, 1287, 1257, 1236, 1215, 1317, 1216, 1229, 1298], "Nay": [1266, 1311, 1312, 1314, 1310, 1280, 1263]}}, {"bill_id": 9251, "action_date": "2018-02-23T13:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 49814, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/49814.pdf", "status_text": "First Reading", "journal_page": 579, "committee_id_action": 395, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 9251, "action_date": "2018-02-26T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 49891, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/49891.pdf", "status_text": "Concurred in Resolution", "journal_page": 599, "committee_id_action": 395, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 26405, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [1239, 1230, 1264, 1231, 1217, 1246, 1228, 1219, 1273, 1262, 1234, 1290, 1232, 1278, 1270, 1224, 1267, 1243, 1289, 1218, 1244, 1281, 1272, 1233, 1245, 1271, 1252, 1237, 1288, 1220, 1242, 1276], "Excused": [1304, 1221, 1300]}}]}
