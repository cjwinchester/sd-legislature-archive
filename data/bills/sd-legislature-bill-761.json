BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 25-7-6.2 be amended to read as follows: 25-7-6.2. The child support obligation shall be established in accordance with the following schedule subject to such the revisions or deviations as may be permitted pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 25-7-6.1 to 25-7-6.18, inclusive by this chapter . Except as provided in this chapter, the combined monthly net incomes of both parents shall be used in determining the obligation and which shall be divided proportionately between the parents based upon their respective net incomes. The noncustodial parent's proportionate share establishes the amount of the child support order. If the obligation using only the noncustodial parent's monthly net income is an obligation within the emboldened areas of the schedule, that amount shall be compared to the noncustodial parent's proportionate share using both parents' monthly net incomes. The lesser amount establishes the noncustodial parent's child support order. The share of the custodial parent is presumed to be spent directly for the benefit of the child. Section 2. That \u00a7 25-7-6.3 be amended to read as follows: 25-7-6.3. The monthly net income of each parent shall be determined by the parent's gross income less allowable deductions, as set forth herein in this chapter . The monthly gross income of each parent includes amounts received from the following sources: (1) Compensation paid to an employee for personal services, whether salary, wages, commissions, bonus, or otherwise designated; (2) Self-employment income including gain, profit, or loss from a business, farm, or profession; (3) Periodic payments from pensions or retirement programs, including social security or veteran's benefits, disability payments, or insurance contracts; (4) Interest, dividends, rentals, royalties, or other gain derived from investment of capital assets; (5) Gain or loss from the sale, trade, or conversion of capital assets; (6) Unemployment insurance benefits; (7) Worker's compensation benefits; and (8) Benefits in lieu of compensation including military pay allowances. If the income of the parents is derived from seasonal employment, or received in payments other than regular, recurring payments, such income shall be annualized to determine a monthly average income. Overtime wages, commissions, and bonuses may be excluded if the compensation is not a regular and recurring source of income for the parent. Income derived from seasonal employment shall be annualized to determine a monthly average income. Section 3. That \u00a7 25-7-6.4 be amended to read as follows: 25-7-6.4. Except in cases of physical or mental disability, it shall be is presumed for the purposes of determination of child support that a parent is capable of being employed at the minimum wage , including while incarcerated, and his the parent's child support obligation shall be computed at a rate not less than full-time employment at the state minimum wage. Evidence to rebut this presumption may be presented by either parent. Section 4. That \u00a7 25-7-6.10 be amended to read as follows: 25-7-6.10. Deviation from the schedule in \u00a7 25-7-6.2 shall be considered if raised by either party and made only upon the entry of specific findings based upon any of the following factors: (1) The income of a subsequent spouse or contribution of a third party to the income or expenses of that parent but only if the application of the schedule works a financial hardship on either parent; (2) Any financial condition of either parent which would make application of the schedule inequitable. If the total amount of the child support obligation, including any adjustments for health insurance and child care costs, exceeds fifty percent of the obligor's monthly net income, it shall be is presumed that the amount of the obligation imposes a financial hardship on the obligor. This presumption may be rebutted based upon other factors set forth in this section; (3) Any necessary education or health care special needs of the child; (4) The effect of agreements between the parents regarding extra forms of support for the direct benefit of the child; (5) The obligation of either parent to provide for subsequent natural children, adopted children, or stepchildren. However, an existing support order may not be modified solely for this reason; or (6) The voluntary and unreasonable act of either a parent which reduces that parent's income causes the parent to be unemployed or underemployed, unless the reduction of income is due to incarceration . Section 5. That \u00a7 25-7-6.13 be amended to read as follows: 25-7-6.13. All orders for support entered and in effect prior to July 1, 2005 2009 , may be modified in accordance with this chapter without requiring a showing of a change in circumstances from the entry of the order. Section 6. That \u00a7 25-7-6.14 be amended to read as follows: 25-7-6.14. As used in this section, basic visitation means a parenting plan whereby one parent has physical custody and the other parent has visitation with the child of the parties. In a basic visitation situation, unless the parties otherwise agree and the agreement is approved by the court, the court may, if deemed appropriate under the circumstances, order an abatement of not less than thirty-eight percent nor more than sixty-six percent of the child support if: (1) A child spends ten or more days in a month with the obligor; and (2) The days of visitation and the abatement amount are specified in the court order. The court shall allow the abatement to the obligor in the month in which the visitation is exercised, unless otherwise ordered. The abatement shall be pro-rated to the days of visitation. It shall be presumed that the visitation is exercised. If the visitation exercised substantially deviates from the visitation ordered, either party may file a petition for modification without showing any other change in circumstances. As used in this section, shared responsibility means a parenting plan whereby each parent provides a suitable home for the child of the parties, the court order allows the child to spend at least one hundred twenty days in a calendar year in each home, and the parents have agreed in writing to share the duties, responsibilities, and expenses of parenting, including expenses for the child's education, recreation, and entertainment activities. In a shared responsibility situation, unless the parties otherwise agree and the agreement is approved by the court, the court may, if deemed appropriate under the circumstances, order a shared responsibility cross credit. The cross credit shall be calculated by multiplying the combined child support obligation using both parents' monthly net incomes by 1.5 to arrive at a shared custody child support obligation. The shared custody child support obligation shall be apportioned to each parent according to his or her net income. A child support obligation is computed for each parent by multiplying that parent's portion of the shared custody child support obligation by the percentage of time the child spends with the other parent. The respective child support obligations are offset, with the parent owing more child support paying the difference between the two amounts. It shall be presumed that the shared responsibility parenting plan is exercised. If the parenting plan exercised substantially deviates from the parenting plan ordered, either party may file a petition for modification without showing any other change in circumstances. The court shall consider each case individually before granting either the basic visitation or shared responsibility adjustment to insure that the adjustment does not place an undue hardship on the custodial parent or have a substantial negative effect on the child's standard of living. If the child resides with the obligor ten or more nights in a month pursuant to a custody order, the court may, if deemed appropriate under the circumstances, grant an abatement of not less than thirty-eight percent nor more than sixty-six percent of the basic child support obligation for the nights the child resides with the obligor. The order granting the abatement shall specify the number of nights for which the abatement is allowed and the amount of the abatement. In deciding whether an abatement is appropriate, the court shall consider whether it would have a substantial negative effect on the child's standard of living. The court shall allow the abatement to the obligor in the month in which the parenting time is ordered or apportion the abatement over a period of twelve months. It shall be presumed that the parenting time is exercised. If the parenting time exercised substantially deviates from the parenting time ordered, either party may petition the court for modification of the support order without showing any other change in circumstances. Section 7. That \u00a7 25-7-6.16 be amended to read as follows: 25-7-6.16. The court may shall enter an order for health and dental insurance coverage. Medical insurance shall be provided for the benefit of the minor child whenever practical addressing how the child's health care needs will be met by medical support to be provided by one or both of the parents. The medical support order shall include a provision for medical insurance if the insurance is accessible for the child and available to a parent at reasonable cost. Medical insurance is considered accessible if a medical insurance benefit plan is available and provides coverage for the child residing within the geographic area covered by the insurance policy. Medical insurance is considered reasonable in cost if the cost attributable to the child is equal to or less than eight percent of the parent's net income as determined under this chapter, and the amount shall be specified in the order for support . The cost of the insurance attributable to the child shall be determined by dividing the out-of-pocket cost of the insurance to the parent by the number of individuals insured thereunder. However, if information is provided at the time of hearing regarding the actual additional costs for the child's share of the insurance, that figure shall be used. is the cost of adding the child to existing coverage, the difference between self-only coverage and family coverage, or the cost of private medical insurance for the child. The cost attributable to the child under family coverage is the difference between self-only coverage and family coverage divided by the number of individuals, excluding the parent, enrolled in the family coverage. The cost so computed shall be apportioned between the parents on the basis of income or income imputed as provided in \u00a7\u00a7 25-7-6.1 to 25-7-6.17, inclusive this chapter . If one parent pays the entire amount, that parent shall either be reimbursed by the other parent for that parent's portion of the payment or shall receive a credit against his or her support obligation, whichever is appropriate. Any additional, reasonable medical health care costs, including medical, optometric, dental or orthodontic, or counseling , or other health care costs for each minor child which exceed two hundred fifty dollars in any year and are not covered by insurance, shall be apportioned between the parents in proportion to the support obligation of each parent. The parent that has primary physical custody of the child is responsible for the first two hundred fifty dollars of health care costs each calendar year. Section 8. That \u00a7 25-7-6.22 be amended to read as follows: 25-7-6.22. If a parent is employed full-time at a rate of pay that equals or exceeds the state's minimum wage, it shall be is presumed that a parent's second job income is not to be considered in establishing a support obligation. This presumption may be rebutted by evidence that the income source was available to pay expenses related to the child when the family was intact or if the family had formed, by evidence that exclusion of the income would result in a financial hardship upon the other parent, or that exclusion of the second job income will have a substantial negative effect upon the child's standard of living parent initially became obligated for the support of the child pursuant to \u00a7 25-7-6.1 . Section 9. That chapter 25-7 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: If a parent in a child support establishment or modification proceeding fails to furnish income or other financial information, the parent is in default, and that parent's income for purposes of determining child support shall be computed at a rate not less than the most recent annual pay standard as reported by the Department of Labor. Section 10. That chapter 25-7 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: If the parents have agreed in writing to a detailed shared parenting plan which provides that the child will reside no less than one hundred eighty nights per calendar year in each parent's home, and that the parents will share the duties and responsibilities of parenting the child and the expenses of the child in proportion to their incomes, and the shared parenting plan has been incorporated in the custody order, the court may, if deemed appropriate under the circumstances, grant a cross credit on the amount of the child support obligation based on the number of nights the child resides with each parent. The shared parenting child support cross credit shall be calculated as follows: (1) Multiply the parents' combined child support obligation under the schedule by 1.5 to establish the parents' combined shared parenting child support obligation; (2) Multiply the combined shared parenting child support obligation by each parent's percentage share of the parents' combined net incomes to establish each parent's shared parenting child support obligation; (3) Multiply each parent's shared parenting child support obligation by the percentage of nights the child resides with each parent based on a three hundred sixty-five day calendar year to establish each parent's prorated shared parenting child support obligation; (4) Offset the parents' prorated shared parenting child support obligations; and (5) The parent with the larger prorated shared parenting child support obligation shall pay the difference between these amounts. In deciding whether a shared parenting child support cross credit is appropriate, the court shall consider whether it would have a substantial negative effect on the child's standard of living. It is presumed that the parenting time is exercised. If the parenting time exercised substantially deviates from the parenting time ordered, either party may petition the court for a modification of the support order without showing any other change in circumstances. Section 11. That chapter 25-7 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: For the purposes of \u00a7 25-7-6.14 and section 10 of this Act, a child resides with a parent for a night if the child sleeps: (1) At the residence of that parent at night, whether or not the parent is present; or (2) In the company of the parent, if the child does not sleep at a parent's residence. If, in a calendar year, due to a parent's nighttime work schedule, a child resides with a parent for days, but not nights, the court may condition the abatement on the required days rather than nights. In those instances, on a school day, the child is treated as residing at the primary residence registered with the school. Section 12. That \u00a7 25-7A-1 be amended to read as follows: 25-7A-1.

BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 25-7-6.2 be amended to read as follows: 25-7-6.2. The child support obligation shall be established in accordance with the following schedule subject to such the revisions or deviations as may be permitted pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 25-7-6.1 to 25-7-6.18, inclusive by this chapter . Except as provided in this chapter, the combined monthly net incomes of both parents shall be used in determining the obligation and which shall be divided proportionately between the parents based upon their respective net incomes. The noncustodial parent's proportionate share establishes the amount of the child support order. If the obligation using only the noncustodial parent's monthly net income is an obligation within the emboldened areas of the schedule, that amount shall be compared to the noncustodial parent's proportionate share using both parents' monthly net incomes. The lesser amount establishes the noncustodial parent's child support order. The share of the custodial parent is presumed to be spent directly for the benefit of the child. Section 2. That \u00a7 25-7-6.3 be amended to read as follows: 25-7-6.3. The monthly net income of each parent shall be determined by the parent's gross income less allowable deductions, as set forth herein in this chapter . The monthly gross income of each parent includes amounts received from the following sources: (1) Compensation paid to an employee for personal services, whether salary, wages, commissions, bonus, or otherwise designated; (2) Self-employment income including gain, profit, or loss from a business, farm, or profession; (3) Periodic payments from pensions or retirement programs, including social security or veteran's benefits, disability payments, or insurance contracts; (4) Interest, dividends, rentals, royalties, or other gain derived from investment of capital assets; (5) Gain or loss from the sale, trade, or conversion of capital assets; (6) Unemployment insurance benefits; (7) Worker's compensation benefits; and (8) Benefits in lieu of compensation including military pay allowances. If the income of the parents is derived from seasonal employment, or received in payments other than regular, recurring payments, such income shall be annualized to determine a monthly average income. Overtime wages, commissions, and bonuses may be excluded if the compensation is not a regular and recurring source of income for the parent. Income derived from seasonal employment shall be annualized to determine a monthly average income. Section 3. That \u00a7 25-7-6.4 be amended to read as follows: 25-7-6.4. Except in cases of physical or mental disability, it shall be is presumed for the purposes of determination of child support that a parent is capable of being employed at the minimum wage , including while incarcerated, and his the parent's child support obligation shall be computed at a rate not less than full-time employment at the state minimum wage. Evidence to rebut this presumption may be presented by either parent. Section 4. That \u00a7 25-7-6.10 be amended to read as follows: 25-7-6.10. Deviation from the schedule in \u00a7 25-7-6.2 shall be considered if raised by either party and made only upon the entry of specific findings based upon any of the following factors: (1) The income of a subsequent spouse or contribution of a third party to the income or expenses of that parent but only if the application of the schedule works a financial hardship on either parent; (2) Any financial condition of either parent which would make application of the schedule inequitable. If the total amount of the child support obligation, including any adjustments for health insurance and child care costs, exceeds fifty percent of the obligor's monthly net income, it shall be is presumed that the amount of the obligation imposes a financial hardship on the obligor. This presumption may be rebutted based upon other factors set forth in this section; (3) Any necessary education or health care special needs of the child; (4) The effect of agreements between the parents regarding extra forms of support for the direct benefit of the child; (5) The obligation of either parent to provide for subsequent natural children, adopted children, or stepchildren. However, an existing support order may not be modified solely for this reason; or (6) The voluntary and unreasonable act of either a parent which reduces that parent's income causes the parent to be unemployed or underemployed, unless the reduction of income is due to incarceration . Section 5. That \u00a7 25-7-6.13 be amended to read as follows: 25-7-6.13. All orders for support entered and in effect prior to July 1, 2005 2009 , may be modified in accordance with this chapter without requiring a showing of a change in circumstances from the entry of the order. Section 6. That \u00a7 25-7-6.14 be amended to read as follows: 25-7-6.14. As used in this section, basic visitation means a parenting plan whereby one parent has physical custody and the other parent has visitation with the child of the parties. In a basic visitation situation, unless the parties otherwise agree and the agreement is approved by the court, the court may, if deemed appropriate under the circumstances, order an abatement of not less than thirty-eight percent nor more than sixty-six percent of the child support if: (1) A child spends ten or more days in a month with the obligor; and (2) The days of visitation and the abatement amount are specified in the court order. The court shall allow the abatement to the obligor in the month in which the visitation is exercised, unless otherwise ordered. The abatement shall be pro-rated to the days of visitation. It shall be presumed that the visitation is exercised. If the visitation exercised substantially deviates from the visitation ordered, either party may file a petition for modification without showing any other change in circumstances. As used in this section, shared responsibility means a parenting plan whereby each parent provides a suitable home for the child of the parties, the court order allows the child to spend at least one hundred twenty days in a calendar year in each home, and the parents have agreed in writing to share the duties, responsibilities, and expenses of parenting, including expenses for the child's education, recreation, and entertainment activities. In a shared responsibility situation, unless the parties otherwise agree and the agreement is approved by the court, the court may, if deemed appropriate under the circumstances, order a shared responsibility cross credit. The cross credit shall be calculated by multiplying the combined child support obligation using both parents' monthly net incomes by 1.5 to arrive at a shared custody child support obligation. The shared custody child support obligation shall be apportioned to each parent according to his or her net income. A child support obligation is computed for each parent by multiplying that parent's portion of the shared custody child support obligation by the percentage of time the child spends with the other parent. The respective child support obligations are offset, with the parent owing more child support paying the difference between the two amounts. It shall be presumed that the shared responsibility parenting plan is exercised. If the parenting plan exercised substantially deviates from the parenting plan ordered, either party may file a petition for modification without showing any other change in circumstances. The court shall consider each case individually before granting either the basic visitation or shared responsibility adjustment to insure that the adjustment does not place an undue hardship on the custodial parent or have a substantial negative effect on the child's standard of living. If the child resides with the obligor ten or more nights in a month pursuant to a custody order, the court may, if deemed appropriate under the circumstances, grant an abatement of not less than thirty-eight percent nor more than sixty-six percent of the basic child support obligation for the nights the child resides with the obligor. The order granting the abatement shall specify the number of nights for which the abatement is allowed and the amount of the abatement. In deciding whether an abatement is appropriate, the court shall consider whether it would have a substantial negative effect on the child's standard of living. The court shall allow the abatement to the obligor in the month in which the parenting time is ordered or apportion the abatement over a period of twelve months. It shall be presumed that the parenting time is exercised. If the parenting time exercised substantially deviates from the parenting time ordered, either party may petition the court for modification of the support order without showing any other change in circumstances. Section 7. That \u00a7 25-7-6.16 be amended to read as follows: 25-7-6.16. The court may shall enter an order for health and dental insurance coverage. Medical insurance shall be provided for the benefit of the minor child whenever practical addressing how the child's health care needs will be met by medical support to be provided by one or both of the parents. The medical support order shall include a provision for medical insurance if the insurance is accessible for the child and available to a parent at reasonable cost. Medical insurance is considered accessible if a medical insurance benefit plan is available and provides coverage for the child residing within the geographic area covered by the insurance policy. Medical insurance is considered reasonable in cost if the cost attributable to the child is equal to or less than eight percent of the parent's net income as determined under this chapter, and the amount shall be specified in the order for support . The cost of the insurance attributable to the child shall be determined by dividing the out-of-pocket cost of the insurance to the parent by the number of individuals insured thereunder. However, if information is provided at the time of hearing regarding the actual additional costs for the child's share of the insurance, that figure shall be used. is the cost of adding the child to existing coverage, the difference between self-only coverage and family coverage, or the cost of private medical insurance for the child. The cost attributable to the child under family coverage is the difference between self-only coverage and family coverage divided by the number of individuals, excluding the parent, enrolled in the family coverage. The cost so computed shall be apportioned between the parents on the basis of income or income imputed as provided in \u00a7\u00a7 25-7-6.1 to 25-7-6.17, inclusive this chapter . If one parent pays the entire amount, that parent shall either be reimbursed by the other parent for that parent's portion of the payment or shall receive a credit against his or her support obligation, whichever is appropriate. Any additional, reasonable medical health care costs, including medical, optometric, dental or orthodontic, or counseling , or other health care costs for each minor child which exceed two hundred fifty dollars in any year and are not covered by insurance, shall be apportioned between the parents in proportion to the support obligation of each parent. The parent that has primary physical custody of the child is responsible for the first two hundred fifty dollars of health care costs each calendar year. Section 8. That \u00a7 25-7-6.22 be amended to read as follows: 25-7-6.22. If a parent is employed full-time at a rate of pay that equals or exceeds the state's minimum wage, it shall be is presumed that a parent's second job income is not to be considered in establishing a support obligation. This presumption may be rebutted by evidence that the income source was available to pay expenses related to the child when the family was intact or if the family had formed, by evidence that exclusion of the income would result in a financial hardship upon the other parent, or that exclusion of the second job income will have a substantial negative effect upon the child's standard of living parent initially became obligated for the support of the child pursuant to \u00a7 25-7-6.1 . Section 9. That chapter 25-7 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: If a parent in a child support establishment or modification proceeding fails to furnish income or other financial information, the parent is in default, and that parent's income for purposes of determining child support shall be computed at a rate not less than the most recent annual pay standard as reported by the Department of Labor. Section 10. That chapter 25-7 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: If the parents have agreed in writing to a detailed shared parenting plan which provides that the child will reside no less than one hundred eighty nights per calendar year in each parent's home, and that the parents will share the duties and responsibilities of parenting the child and the expenses of the child in proportion to their incomes, and the shared parenting plan has been incorporated in the custody order, the court may, if deemed appropriate under the circumstances, grant a cross credit on the amount of the child support obligation based on the number of nights the child resides with each parent. The shared parenting child support cross credit shall be calculated as follows: (1) Multiply the parents' combined child support obligation under the schedule by 1.5 to establish the parents' combined shared parenting child support obligation; (2) Multiply the combined shared parenting child support obligation by each parent's percentage share of the parents' combined net incomes to establish each parent's shared parenting child support obligation; (3) Multiply each parent's shared parenting child support obligation by the percentage of nights the child resides with each parent based on a three hundred sixty-five day calendar year to establish each parent's prorated shared parenting child support obligation; (4) Offset the parents' prorated shared parenting child support obligations; and (5) The parent with the larger prorated shared parenting child support obligation shall pay the difference between these amounts. In deciding whether a shared parenting child support cross credit is appropriate, the court shall consider whether it would have a substantial negative effect on the child's standard of living. It is presumed that the parenting time is exercised. If the parenting time exercised substantially deviates from the parenting time ordered, either party may petition the court for a modification of the support order without showing any other change in circumstances. Section 11. That chapter 25-7 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: For the purposes of \u00a7 25-7-6.14 and section 10 of this Act, a child resides with a parent for a night if the child sleeps: (1) At the residence of that parent at night, whether or not the parent is present; or (2) In the company of the parent, if the child does not sleep at a parent's residence. If, in a calendar year, due to a parent's nighttime work schedule, a child resides with a parent for days, but not nights, the court may condition the abatement on the required days rather than nights. In those instances, on a school day, the child is treated as residing at the primary residence registered with the school. Section 12. That \u00a7 25-7A-1 be amended to read as follows: 25-7A-1.
