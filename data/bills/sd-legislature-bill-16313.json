In all cases of joint tenancy in lands or personal property, and in all cases where any estate, title or interest in, or lien upon, lands or personal property has been or may be created, which estate, title, interest, or lien was or is to continue only during the life of any person named or described in the instrument by which such estate, title, interest or lien was created, a copy of the record of the death of any such joint tenant or of the person upon whose life such estate, title, interest, or lien was or is limited, duly certified by any officer who is required by the laws of the state or county in which such record is made, to keep a record of the death of persons occurring within the jurisdiction of such officer, may be recorded in the office of the register of deeds of the county in which such lands are situated or in the proper office for filing as to such personal property.

Section 4. That \u00a7 21-44-7 be repealed. 21-44-7.

The department need not be specifically named in the notice and may file a claim for any indebtedness owed pursuant to \u00a7 \u00a7 28-6-23 to 28-6-27, inclusive, at or before the hearing. Section 7. That \u00a7 21-44-10 be amended to read as follows: 21-44-10. If a proceeding for the termination of a life estate under the provisions of this chapter involves the termination of a joint tenancy in which the only surviving joint tenant is the spouse of the decedent, the decedent held no assets other than in joint tenancy with the surviving spouse or life insurance payable to the surviving spouse and the decedent died after June 30, 1980, the court in which the proceeding is pending shall have jurisdiction to determine and decree that, under \u00a7 10-40-23.1, no inheritance tax is due by reason of the death of the joint tenant. However, in any other proceeding for the termination of a life estate under the provisions of this chapter, any person desiring to have a determination of inheritance tax chargeable against the property or the surviving life tenant or tenants by reason of the death of the life tenant, may obtain in the proceeding a judicial determination as to whether or not any such tax is due and, if so, the amount which is due, by serving upon the Department of Revenue of the State of South Dakota at least fourteen days prior to the date of hearing a copy of the order for hearing provided for by \u00a7 21-44-8, and at the same time filing with the clerk of the court where the proceedings are pending an inventory and report directed to the Department of Revenue furnishing the information prescribed by \u00a7 10-41-17 and serving a copy of the inventory and report with proof of the filing of the original upon the Department of Revenue . The Department of Revenue shall file promptly with the clerk of court a formal receipt for the inventory and report. The receipt may be withheld until the furnishing of further information if the inventory and report are not complete. Upon the filing of the receipt, the court shall have jurisdiction to determine and decree whether or not any inheritance tax is due by reason of the death of the life tenant and the coming in of the surviving life tenant or tenants and, if so, the amount of tax due.

Whether or not such petition is opposed, the court must inquire into the matters set forth and shall grant the prayer of such petition only if satisfied that the life tenant is in fact deceased, and that his right, title, or interest in, or lien or encumbrance upon, the real estate or personal property involved, has terminated by reason of his death. Section 11. That \u00a7 21-44-15 be repealed. 21-44-15. Clear and convincing proof of the identity and death of the life tenant must be submitted. If the court is not satisfied with the proof offered at the hearing whether it be contested or not, the court may adjourn such hearing to a convenient future date, and require the petitioner at such adjourned hearing to produce a certified copy of the death certificate of the life tenant, if he died within a state where such certificates are a matter of public record, or in lieu thereof, the affidavits of two or more persons, that they knew the life tenant in his lifetime, and after his death saw his body. If such affidavits are made outside South Dakota, they must be accompanied by a statement of an officer of the state or country where such affidavits are made, that he personally knows affiants, that they are persons having a good reputation for truth and veracity, and as law abiding citizens. Section 12. That \u00a7 21-44-16 be repealed. 21-44-16. If the life tenant was in the military service at the time of his death, the written statement of his commanding officer giving the facts of his death, signed by such commanding officer with his rank and organization, or the affidavit of one or more soldiers who knew the fact of his death, may be accepted in lieu of any of the proof required by \u00a7 21-44-15. Section 13. That \u00a7 21-44-17 be amended to read as follows: 21-44-17. If any person upon whose life any estate or interest in property depends, remains without the United States or absents himself in the state or elsewhere for seven years together, such person must be accounted naturally dead in any action or special proceeding concerning any such property in which his death shall come in question unless sufficient proof be made in such case that he is living. A person upon whose life any estate or interest in property depends, may be determined naturally dead by the court under the following circumstances: (1) If such person has not been seen or heard from for a continuous period of five years, if the absence is not satisfactorily explained after diligent search or inquiry; or (2) In the absence of prima facie proof of death, if the fact of death is established by other competent evidence including circumstantial evidence. Section 14. That \u00a7 21-44-18 be repealed. 21-44-18. If the court is not satisfied with the proof finally offered, the court may deny the petition or order the petitioner to proceed under chapter 21-41. Section 15.

The order or judgment of the court shall be of the same force and effect and finality of other judgments of the circuit court. If the court shall find or adjudge as a fact that the life tenant is deceased, such adjudication terminates all right, title, interest, lien, or claim of such life tenant and those claiming under him adversely to the remainderman or his successor in interest, unless the same is asserted as provided in \u00a7 21-44-24. Section 16. That \u00a7 21-44-22 be amended to read as follows: 21-44-22. In all instances where an order terminating a life estate of any person in and to any real property has been made by the circuit court as previously provided by this chapter, any and all such orders for hearing and all orders and decrees made and entered in any such proceedings in the circuit court aforesaid, where the hearing has been had at the time and place as specified in the order for hearing, notwithstanding the fact that less than three weeks intervened between the date of the first publication of notice and the date of hearing, and notwithstanding any failure in any or either of said proceedings to state the date of the death of the life tenant are hereby legalized and validated. Section 17. That \u00a7 21-44-23 be repealed. 21-44-23. A certified copy of the order or judgment of the circuit court must be filed in the office of the register of deeds of the county wherein the real estate involved, or any portion sought to be affected by the judgment is situated. Thirty days after such recording the same shall constitute prima facie evidence of the fact of the death of the life tenant and of all other matters set forth in such order. Section 18. That \u00a7 21-44-24 be amended to read as follows: 21-44-24. Any person interested who questions the fact of such death may at any time commence an action in the circuit court to set aside the judgment or order of the court termination of the life estate and file for record in the office of such register of deeds, a notice subscribed and verified by him, giving the description of the real estate or personal property involved, and the basis and reasons as to his raising such question as to the fact of death, but no purchaser or encumbrancer of such real estate or personal property, or any part thereof, in good faith and for value, more than thirty days after the recording of the certified copy of the order or judgment termination of the life estate shall be subject to any claim growing out of the rights of the life tenant. Section 19. That chapter 21-44 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Any action or proceeding commenced by any person prior to July 1, 2001, under any procedure authorized by this chapter, whether irregular or not, is hereby in all things legalized, cured, and validated."}, {"bill_id": 16313, "bill_version_id": 89269, "bill_version": "Senate Judiciary Engrossed", "bill_version_date": "2001-02-05T08:17:27-06:00", "bill_text": "FOR AN ACT ENTITLED, An Act to revise certain provisions concerning the termination of life estates and joint tenancies.
