The bonds shall bear interest at such rate, be in such denominations, be in such form, either coupon or registered, be evidenced by physical certificates or uncertificated, carry such registration privileges, be executed in such manner, be payable in such medium of payment, at such place, and be subject to such terms of redemption, including redemption prior to maturity, as the resolution or the instrument providing for the issuance of such bonds may provide.

The interest rate may be based upon any formula or contractual arrangement for the periodic determination of interest rates, all as may be established in the resolution or instrument providing for the issuance of such bonds. Any such formula or contractual arrangement may authorize the delegation of the interest rate setting function to a third party subject only to such standards or criteria as are set forth in the resolution or instrument providing for the issuance of the bonds. In no event may the setting or resetting of the rate of interest on the board's bonds or the conversion from one method of determining interest to another constitute a reissuance or refunding of bonds issued by the board if such action is taken in accordance with the resolution or instrument providing for the initial issuance of the bonds. The board may issue noninterest bearing bonds or bonds bearing interest at a rate of zero percent and sell the bonds at a price as may be determined by the board. Section 15. Any pledge made by the board is valid and binding from the time the pledge is made. The revenue, money, or properties so pledged and thereafter received by or on behalf of the board are immediately subject to the lien of the pledge without any physical delivery thereof or further act. The lien of any such pledge is valid and binding as against all parties having claims of any kind in tort, contract, or otherwise against the board, irrespective of whether the parties have notice. Neither the resolution nor the trust indenture, if any, nor any other instrument by which a pledge is created need be recorded. Section 16. The board, subject to such agreements with bondholders as may then exist, may purchase and cancel its bonds out of any funds available therefor, at any reasonable price which, if the bonds are then redeemable, may not exceed the redemption price then applicable plus accrued interest to the next interest payment thereon. Section 17. The bonds may be secured by a trust indenture by and between the board and a corporate trustee which may be any bank having the power of a trust company or any trust company within or without the state. The trust indenture may contain such provisions for protecting and enforcing the rights and remedies of the bondholders as may be reasonable and proper and not in violation of law, including covenants setting forth the duties of the board in relation to the exercise of its powers and the custody, safekeeping, and application of all money. The board may provide by the trust indenture for the payment of the proceeds of the bonds and the revenue to the trustee under the trust indenture or other depository, and for the method of disbursement thereof, with such safeguards and restrictions as the board may determine. All expenses incurred in carrying out the trust indenture may be treated as a part of the operating expenses of the board. Section 18. Any proceeds of bonds not needed for immediate disbursement may be held uninvested or invested in any one or more of the following: (1) Obligations issued or guaranteed by the United States of America; (2) Obligations issued or guaranteed by any person controlled or supervised by and acting as an instrumentality of the United States of America pursuant to board granted by the Congress of the United States of America; (3) Obligations issued or guaranteed by any state of the United States of America, or the District of Columbia, or any political subdivision of any such state or district; (4) Commercial paper or corporate debt obligations having a rating by Standard & Poor's Corporation or Moody's Investors Service equal to an \"A\" or higher rating assigned by such organization; (5) Banker's acceptances drawn on and accepted by any bank, trust company, or national banking association organized under the laws of any state or of the United States of America; (6) Repurchase agreements fully secured by obligations issued or guaranteed by the United States of America or by any person controlled or supervised by and acting as an instrumentality of the United States of America pursuant to board granted by the Congress of the United States of America; (7) Certificates of deposit or time deposits issued by any bank, trust company, or national banking association organized under the laws of any state or of the United States of America; (8) United States dollar-denominated certificates of deposits issued by, or time deposits with, the European subsidiaries of any bank, trust company, or national banking association incorporated or doing business under the laws of the United States of America or one of the states thereof; (9) Certificates or units issued by any mutual fund, unit investment trust, or similar entity evidencing interest in obligations described above. Section 19. Whether or not the bonds are in the form and character of negotiable instruments, such bonds are hereby made negotiable instruments, subject only to provisions of the bonds relating to registration. Section 20. Bonds of the board may be executed by the manual or facsimile signatures of the board members or officers of the board authorized by the resolution of the board to execute such bonds. If the resolution authorizes or directs the affixing of the seal of the board on bonds of the board, the seal or a facsimile may be impressed or imprinted on the bonds. If any board members or officers of the board cease to be members or officers of the board before the delivery of any bonds or coupons signed by them, their signatures or facsimiles are nevertheless valid and sufficient for all purposes, the same as if the members or officers had remained in office until the delivery. Section 21. Neither the members of the board nor any other person executing the bonds issued under this Act is subject to personal liability or accountability by reason of the issuance thereof. Section 22. The state hereby pledges to and agrees with the holder of any bonds issued under this Act that the state will not limit or alter the rights vested in the board to fulfill the terms of any agreements made with the holders or in any way impair the rights or remedies of the holders until the bonds, together with the interest, with interest on any unpaid installments of interest, and all costs and expenses in connection with any action or proceeding by or on behalf of the holders, are fully met and discharged. The board may include this pledge and agreement of the state in any agreement with the holders of the bonds. Section 23. Any member or employee of the board who has, will have, or later acquires a personal interest, direct or indirect, in any transaction with the board shall immediately disclose the nature and extent of such interest in writing to the board as soon as the member or employee has knowledge of such actual or prospective interest. The disclosure shall be entered upon the minutes of the board. Upon such disclosure the member or employee may not participate in any action by the board authorizing the transaction. Actions taken if the member or employee reasonably believed that the member or employee had and would not have any conflict are not invalidated because of such conflict. The fact that a member is also an officer or owner of an organization is not a direct or indirect interest unless: (1) The member has an ownership interest of greater than five percent in the organization; or (2) The transaction in question does not involve all similar organizations, but rather involves only the board and the organization. Section 24. The exercise of the powers granted by this Act is in all respects for the benefit of the people of the state, and the board is not required to pay any tax or assessment on any property owned by the board under the provisions of this Act or upon the income therefrom; nor is the board required to pay any transfer tax of any kind on account of instruments recorded by it or on its behalf. Any obligations issued by the board pursuant to this Act, their transfer, and the income therefrom (including any profit made on the sale thereof), is free from taxation by the state or any local unit or political subdivision or other instrumentality of the state. Section 25. The bonds and notes of the board are hereby made securities in which all public officers and bodies of this state and all municipal subdivisions, all insurance companies and associations and other persons carrying on insurance business, all banks, bankers, trust companies, including savings and loan associations, building and loan associations, investment banking companies and other persons carrying on an investment banking business, all administrators, conservators, executors, trustees and other fiduciaries, and all other persons who are now or may hereafter be authorized to invest in bonds or obligations of the state, may properly and legally invest in the bonds and notes of the board funds including capital in their own control or belonging to them. The bonds and notes are also hereby made securities which may be deposited with and may be received by all public officers and bodies of this state and all municipalities and municipal subdivisions for any purpose for which the deposit of bonds or notes or other obligations of this state is now or may hereafter be authorized. Section 26. If, after all indebtedness and other obligations of the board are discharged, the board is dissolved, its remaining assets shall inure to the benefit of the state. Section 27. The board shall submit to the Governor and the Legislature within ninety days of the close of its fiscal year a complete and detailed report setting forth: (1) Its operations and accomplishments; (2) Its receipts and expenditures during the fiscal year in accordance with the categories or classifications established by the board for its operating and capital outlay purposes; (3) Its assets and liabilities at the end of its fiscal year, including a schedule of its loans and commitments and the status of reserve, special, or other funds; and (4) A schedule of its notes and bonds outstanding at the end of its fiscal year, together with a statement of the amounts redeemed and incurred during the fiscal year.

The rules shall include the following: (1) A definition of premium livestock, including cattle, hogs, and other livestock animals, and criteria to determine whether an animal may be classified as premium livestock; (2) The criteria to be met for an animal to be designated as a certified premium South Dakota livestock animal."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 15094, "action_date": "2000-01-18T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 85631, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/85631.pdf", "status_text": "First read in Senate and referred to", "journal_page": 72, "committee_id_action": 657, "committee_id_assigned": 630, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 15094, "action_date": "2000-01-27T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 85798, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/85798.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 630, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 15094, "action_date": "2000-01-27T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 85798, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/85798.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to 36th legislative day", "journal_page": 216, "committee_id_action": 630, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 45481, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [2310, 2311, 2346, 2347, 2400, 2329], "Nay": [2358, 2386, 2398]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/15094"}
