BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 25-4-45 be amended to read: 25-4-45. In an action for divorce, the court may, before or after judgment, give such direction for the custody, care, and education of the children of the marriage as may seem necessary or proper, and may at any time vacate or modify the same. In awarding the custody of a child, the court shall be guided by consideration of what appears to be for the best interests of the child in respect to the child's temporal and mental and moral welfare. If the child is of a sufficient age to form an intelligent preference, the court may shall consider that preference in determining the question. As between parents adversely claiming the custody, neither parent may be given preference over the other in determining custody. 100 copies were printed on recycled paper by the South Dakota Legislative Research Council at a cost of $.161 per page. .
