Failure to maintain financial responsibility is a Class 2 misdemeanor. Section 2. That \u00a7 32-35-70 be amended to read as follows: 32-35-70. An owner's policy of liability insurance referred to in \u00a7 32-35-68 shall insure the person named therein and any other person as insured, using any insured vehicle or vehicles with the express or implied permission of the named insured, against loss from the liability imposed by law for damages arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of the vehicle or vehicles within the United States of America or the Dominion of Canada, subject to limits exclusive of interests and costs, with respect to each insured vehicle, as follows: twenty-five fifty thousand dollars because of bodily injury to or death of one person in any one accident and, subject to the limit for one person, fifty one hundred thousand dollars because of bodily injury to or death of two or more persons in any one accident, and twenty-five thousand dollars because of injury to or destruction of property of others in any one accident. If the policy complies with the filing and form requirements of Title 58 and has been approved by the Division of Insurance, the driver and owner has complied with this chapter. The policy may exclude liability coverage if the policyholder certifies in writing that the vehicle will not be operated during the policy period. The policy may exclude or limit coverage pursuant to \u00a7 58-11-9.3, or for a relative residing in the named insured's household. Policies issued after January 1, 1987, and owners who have purchased such policies are in compliance with this chapter. Date of compliance does not affect any pending litigation. Section 3. That \u00a7 32-35-2 be amended to read as follows: 32-35-2. The term, proof of financial responsibility for the future, as used in this chapter means proof of ability to respond in damages for liability, on account of accidents occurring after the effective date of the proof, arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of a vehicle of a type subject to registration under the laws of this state, in the amount of twenty-five fifty thousand dollars because of bodily injury to or death of one person in any one accident, and, subject to the limit for one person, in the amount of fifty one hundred thousand dollars because of bodily injury to or death of two or more persons in any one accident, and in the amount of twenty-five thousand dollars because of injury to or destruction of property of others in any one accident.
