Every grain buyer licensed in this state shall, at such times as the commission requires, furnish the commission on forms prepared by the commission, reports showing the facts and information required by the commission. The reports are not for public inspection, but the commission may, upon request, furnish the total of the figures shown on such reports if the figures requested are for not less than four grain buyers. The commission may also require that a grain buyer provide any other documents and information regarding the business of the grain buyer. None of the documents and information obtained through the licensing and inspection processes are subject to public inspection. A violation of this section is a Class 1 misdemeanor. Section 16. That \u00a7 49-45-16 be amended to read as follows: 49-45-16. The commission may immediately suspend the license of a grain buyer and the grain buyer shall surrender the license to the commission if: (1) The grain buyer refuses, neglects, or is unable, upon proper demand, to redeem any scale ticket issued by the grain buyer, through redelivery or cash payment; (2) The grain buyer refuses, neglects, or is unable to provide a bond in an amount required by the commission; or (3) The commission has knowledge of any act of insolvency, including the filing of a petition in bankruptcy naming the grain buyer as debtor; or (4) The grain buyer refuses to submit to an inspection or cooperate with the lawful requests of a commission inspector, including requests for access to and copies of the books and records of the grain buyer. Within fifteen days the grain buyer may request a hearing pursuant to chapter 1-26 to determine if the license should be revoked. If no request is made within fifteen days, the commission shall revoke the license. Section 17. That chapter 49-45 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: If at any time during the licensing period a grain buyer becomes aware that the grain buyer is not in compliance with each financial standard, as set forth in the commission's rules, the grain buyer shall immediately notify the commission of the grain buyer's financial condition. When notification occurs, the commission shall immediately conduct an examination to determine if any grounds for suspension pursuant to \u00a7 49-45-16 have occurred. A willful violation of this section that results in a financial loss to a grain supplier is a Class 6 felony. A willful violation that does not result in a financial loss to a grain supplier is a Class 1 misdemeanor.

Any requested materials shall be provided to the inspector at a licensed location within the state or at the offices of the commission. A willful violation of this section is a Class 1 misdemeanor. In addition, the commission may assess a civil fine in an amount not to exceed one thousand dollars for each day requested materials are withheld up to a maximum of twenty thousand dollars. Section 19. That chapter 49-45 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: The owner, manager, or chief executive officer of a grain buyer, or any other person in a managerial position, who is responsible for any violation of this chapter by a grain buyer is subject to any criminal penalty that applies to a grain buyer under the provisions of this chapter. Section 20. That chapter 49-45 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: If an applicant for a grain buyer license that is a wholly owned subsidiary of a parent company submits the financial statements of the parent company, the parent company furnishing the financial statements is responsible for all the financial obligations incurred by the licensed entity related to the purchase and storage of grain, including any voluntary credit sale contract.
