BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That chapter 27B-2 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Each person hired by a community service provider shall submit to a criminal background investigation, by means of fingerprint checks by the Division of Criminal Investigation and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The community service provider shall submit completed fingerprint cards to the Division of Criminal Investigation before the prospective new employee enters into service. If no disqualifying record is identified at the state level, the fingerprints shall be forwarded by the Division of Criminal Investigation to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for a national criminal history record check. Any person whose employment is subject to the requirements of this section may enter into service on a temporary basis pending receipt of results of the criminal background investigation. The employing community service provider may, without liability, withdraw its offer of employment or terminate the temporary employment without notice if the report reveals a disqualifying record. Any person whose employment is subject to the requirements of this section shall pay any fees charged for the criminal record check. However, the community service provider may reimburse the person for the fees. Section 2. That chapter 27B-2 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: A community service provider may refuse to employ a person, either directly or by contract, who has been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude as defined in subdivision 22-1- 2(25). No person may be employed by a community service provider, either directly or by contract, if the person has been convicted of a crime of violence as defined in subdivision 22-1-2(9), a sex offense as defined in \u00a7 22-22-30, or trafficking in narcotics. Nothing in this section prohibits a community service provider from considering any criminal conviction in making a hiring decision. Section 3. That chapter 27B-2 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Any person employed by a community service provider on the effective date of this Act who remains continuously employed by the same community service provider for consecutive years is not required to submit to a criminal background check as provided in section 1 of this Act. Section 4. That chapter 27B-2 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: For purposes of this Act, the term, conviction, means a plea or verdict of guilty or a conviction following a plea of nolo contendere in this state or any other state. A duly certified copy of the court record is proof of the conviction and sentence."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 16611, "action_date": "2001-01-30T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 88981, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/88981.pdf", "status_text": "First read in Senate and referred to", "journal_page": 281, "committee_id_action": 713, "committee_id_assigned": 691, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 16611, "action_date": "2001-02-05T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 89307, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/89307.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for Committee hearing on this date", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 691, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 16611, "action_date": "2001-02-05T10:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 89307, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/89307.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to 41st legislative day", "journal_page": 370, "committee_id_action": 691, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 51192, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [2520, 2531, 2584, 2529, 2617], "Excused": [2551], "Nay": [2569]}}]}
