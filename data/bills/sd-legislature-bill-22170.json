The department shall establish a sixty-day period in which an application must be received. The secretary shall deposit fees collected under this chapter in the hemp regulatory program fund. No application for licensure to plant, grow, or produce industrial hemp may be for less than five one-half, contiguous outdoor acres and an indoor greenhouse that may not be less than two thousand eight hundred eighty square feet.

If a test reveals a delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol concentration of more than three-tenths of one percent but not more than five-tenths of one percent, the licensee may request a retest at the licensee's expense. If, upon the retesting, the delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol concentration exceeds three-tenths of one percent, the entire lot from which the noncompliant sample was collected shall be destroyed as provided by \u00a7 38-35-9. However, a sample that tests a result within a measurement of uncertainty that produces a range that includes a delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol concentration of three-tenths of one percent is compliant for the purposes of this chapter. For the purposes of this section, the measure of uncertainty means the parameter, associated with the result of a measurement, that characterizes the dispersion of the values that could reasonably be attributed to the particular quantity subject to measurement.

The grower licensee transportation permit is valid for the length of the grower license. During transportation pursuant to the grower licensee transportation permit, the transporter may only be the grower licensee, a key participant, or a person working under contract with or under the direction of the grower licensee. The transporter shall have in the transporter's physical possession a copy of the grower license under which the industrial hemp was grown or produced and a manifest that includes the following information about the industrial hemp being transported: the specific name and address of the transporter, the specific lot from which the hemp was harvested, the destination storage location for the hemp, and the type of vehicle being used. All other transporters shall obtain the general hemp transportation permit. During transportation pursuant to the general hemp transportation permit, the If the transporter is not a grower licensee, that transporter shall have in the transporter's physical possession the following documentation: (1) A copy of the license under which the industrial hemp was grown or produced; (2) A laboratory report produced by a Drug Enforcement Administration-registered laboratory that confirms the lot of origin of all hemp being transported complies with 7 U.S.C. Chapter 38, Subchapter VII, as provided in 7 C.F.R 990.70(d) and 990.71(d) in effect as of January 1, 2020; (3) A signed affirmation from the licensee and the transporter that no illicit drugs or variations of hemp not explicitly authorized by 7 U.S.C.

No political subdivision, agency, law enforcement officer, or the state is liable for the seizure, spoilage, or destruction of any hemp shipment that does not meet the requirements of this chapter, regardless of whether the shipment is later established to be industrial hemp.

If, upon the retesting, the delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol concentration exceeds three-tenths of one percent, the entire lot from which the noncompliant sample was collected shall be destroyed as provided by \u00a7 38-35-9. However, a sample that tests a result within a measurement of uncertainty that produces a range that includes a delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol concentration of three-tenths of one percent is compliant for the purposes of this chapter.

No political subdivision, agency, law enforcement officer, or the state is liable for the seizure, spoilage, or destruction of any hemp shipment that does not meet the requirements of this chapter, regardless of whether the shipment is later established to be industrial hemp.
