The scholarship shall be reinstated beginning the semester following that in which the student achieves a cumulative grade point average of 3.0, or greater, on a 4.0 scale. Reinstatement of a scholarship does not extend the time allowed under the scholarship program; any scholarship award forfeited cannot be reclaimed after a student has regained eligibility. A student whose cumulative grade point average falls below 3.0 on a 4.0 scale a second time forfeits the scholarship for all subsequent semesters; (2) Complete fifteen credit hours of instruction per semester. The student shall enroll (a) Enroll in and complete at least fifteen credit hours of instruction in each consecutive spring and fall term if the student completed ninth grade prior to the 2010-2011 school year; or (b) Enroll in and complete at least thirty credit hours of instruction in each academic year if the student completed ninth grade in the 2010-2011 school year or thereafter. For purposes of this subdivision, an academic year consists of consecutive fall and spring terms. If the executive director of the Board of Regents determines that a student's failure to enroll or to maintain continued enrollment occurred as a direct result of legitimate factors outside the student's control, or has resulted from the student's participation in an activity that in the executive director's judgment provides knowledge or experience that will enhance the student's academic pursuits, the executive director may extend the student's eligibility to participate in the program for up to two additional years, if the student does not enroll in a noneligible institution; and (3) Sit for and pass all sections of a college proficiency exam as required by Board of Regents Policy Number 2.28 as in effect on January 1, 2003, at the end of the sophomore year. The Board of regents may review and adjust the proficiency examinations administered in keeping with sound academic practice. If such changes are made, the Board of Regents shall notify all eligible institutions of new testing standards or requirements. If the student fails to pass the proficiency examinations the first time, eligibility is forfeited for continuation in the scholarship program."}, {"bill_id": 1671, "bill_version_id": 12504,
