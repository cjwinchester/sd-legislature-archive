Furthermore, at least two thousand five hundred dollars of gross income is annually derived from the pursuit of agriculture from the land. If there is a crop share arrangement, the gross income from the land of both the landlord and tenant shall be combined and used to meet this criteria; (2) Its principal use is devoted to the raising and harvesting of crops or timber or fruit trees, the rearing, feeding, and management of farm livestock, poultry, fish, or nursery stock, the production of bees and apiary products, or horticulture, all for intended profit pursuant to subdivision (1) of this section.

The same acreage specifications apply to platted land, excluding land platted as a subdivision, which is in an unincorporated area. However, the board of county commissioners may increase the minimum acre requirement up to one hundred sixty acres. For the purposes of this section, the term, management unit, means any parcels of land, whether adjoining or not, under common ownership located within this state and managed and operated as a unit for one or more of the principal uses listed in this section.
