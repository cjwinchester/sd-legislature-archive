WHEREAS, the period beginning in 2012 and ending in 2015 marks the bicentennial anniversary of the events and battles of the War of 1812 and the origins of \"The Star Spangled Banner\"; and WHEREAS, the War of 1812, which has been referred to as the \"Second War of Independence\", confirmed the independence of the United States from Great Britain in the eyes of the world and shaped the prosperity of the United States that ensued; and WHEREAS, despite the vastly superior size of the military of Great Britain, the United States Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Revenue Marine Service (a predecessor of the United States Coast Guard), and state militias (the predecessors of the National Guard), won a number of significant victories, ensuring that the liberties won by the United States during the Revolutionary War were not lost; and WHEREAS, major battles of the War of 1812 that were fought on the water, including the battle between the U.S.S. Constitution and the H.M.S. Guerriere, the Battle of Lake Champlain, and victories on the Great Lakes, showcased the might, bravery, and war-fighting tactics of the United States maritime forces; and WHEREAS, the decisive victory of Oliver Hazard Perry over a British fleet near Put-In-Bay, Ohio, in the Battle of Lake Erie ensured that: (1) The United States gained control of the Great Lakes; and (2) Portions of the Old Northwest Territory, such as Ohio, Michigan, Illinois, Minnesota, and Wisconsin, remained part of the United States; and WHEREAS, state militias, the oldest component of the armed forces of the United States, answered the call to service, defending their communities and their country from aggression by Great Britain; and WHEREAS, United States forces seized the city of Mobile from Spanish control in 1813, built Fort Bowyer to protect the city, and in 1814 successfully repelled a vastly larger British force from the city, resulting in Mobile becoming one of the few permanent land concessions gained by the United States during the War of 1812; and WHEREAS, Great Britain unleashed grievous attacks on the capital of the United States, Washington, D.C., burning to the ground the United States Capitol Building, the White House, and much of the rest of the city, except for the U.S. Marine Barracks at 8th & I Street; and WHEREAS, after two and one-half years of conflict, the British Royal Navy sailed up the Chesapeake Bay in an attempt to capture Baltimore, Maryland; and WHEREAS, United States forces at Fort McHenry, stationed in the outer harbor of Baltimore, Maryland, under the command of Brevet Lieutenant Colonel George Armistead, withstood nearly twenty-five hours of bombardment by the British forces and refused to yield, thereby forcing the British to give up the invasion and withdraw; and WHEREAS, Francis Scott Key, on September 14, 1814 , while being held by the British on board a United States flag-of-truce vessel in the harbor, witnessed \"by the dawn's early light\", an American flag still flying over Fort McHenry after the horrific attack and immortalized the event in a poem entitled \"Defense of Fort McHenry\", which was later set to music and called \"The Star-Spangled Banner\"; and WHEREAS, \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" became the national anthem of the United States on March 3, 1931, when President Herbert Hoover signed Public Law 71-823: O say can you see, by the dawn's early light, What so proudly we hail'd at the twilight's last gleaming, Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight O'er the ramparts we watch'd were so gallantly streaming? And the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air, Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there, O say does that star-spangled banner yet wave O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave? On the shore dimly seen through the mists of the deep Where the foe's haughty host in dread silence reposes, What is that which the breeze, o'er the towering steep, As it fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses? Now it catches the gleam of the morning's first beam, In full glory reflected now shines in the stream, 'Tis the star-spangled banner - O long may it wave O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave! And where is that band who so vauntingly swore, That the havoc of war and the battle's confusion A home and a Country should leave us no more? Their blood has wash'd out their foul footstep's pollution. No refuge could save the hireling and slave From the terror of flight or the gloom of the grave, And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave. O thus be it ever when freemen shall stand Between their lov'd home and the war's desolation! Blest with vict'ry and peace may the heav'n rescued land Praise the power that hath made and preserv'd us a nation! Then conquer we must, when our cause it is just, And this be our motto - \"In God is our trust,\" And the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave; and WHEREAS, these sentiments expressed in \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" have come to embody the very spirit of our beloved nation and our national ensign; and WHEREAS, the people of the United States are eternally grateful for the rights defended through hard fighting during the War of 1812 by the United States Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Revenue Marine Service, and state militias, including the protection of United States citizens at home and abroad, unrestricted trade, free and open ports, and the protection of the territorial integrity of the United States against aggression; and WHEREAS, during the bicentennial years of the War of 1812 and \"The Star Spangled Banner\", it is fitting that the bravery and steadfast determination of the United States land and maritime forces be celebrated by the grateful people of the United States: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the House of Representatives of the Eighty-Ninth Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the Senate concurring therein, that the South Dakota Legislature honors the memory of all the people of the United States who came together during the War of 1812, particularly the fallen heroes who gave their lives during the \"Second War of Independence\"; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that we commend the men and women of the United States Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, Coast Guard, and the state National Guards, who have faithfully preserved our freedoms and this great nation, that were secured during the hard fought victories of the War of 1812; and BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED, that we call on the great people of South Dakota in the communities across the state, in our schools, and our veterans organizations, to commemorate the bicentennial of the War of 1812 and \"The Star Spangled Banner\" in events throughout our great state, and help celebrate that after that war, and all those that have ensued since, that as Francis Scott Key wrote, \"our flag was still there\"."}, {"bill_id": 5863, "bill_version_id": 30242, "bill_version": "Enrolled", "bill_version_date": "2014-02-12T09:18:40.503-06:00", "bill_text": ""}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 5863, "action_date": "2014-02-06T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 29939, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/29939.pdf", "status_text": "First Reading", "journal_page": 308, "committee_id_action": 231, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 5863, "action_date": "2014-02-07T13:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 30024, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/30024.pdf", "status_text": "Adopt Resolution", "journal_page": 335, "committee_id_action": 231, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 15780, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [528, 527, 453, 522, 525, 467, 524, 456, 489, 517, 519, 505, 431, 455, 425, 504, 481, 509, 503, 477, 501, 520, 479, 457, 454, 523, 496, 458, 451, 466, 845, 499, 442, 521, 507, 487, 423, 439, 500, 502, 497, 515, 511, 512, 463, 518, 484, 462, 485, 514, 464, 510, 450, 506, 430, 513, 498, 461, 516, 508, 480, 460, 448, 441], "Excused": [433, 449, 476, 478, 459, 468]}}, {"bill_id": 5863, "action_date": "2014-02-10T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 30120, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/30120.pdf", "status_text": "First Reading", "journal_page": 266, "committee_id_action": 229, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 5863, "action_date": "2014-02-11T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 30211, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/30211.pdf", "status_text": "Concurred in Resolution", "journal_page": 291, "committee_id_action": 229, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 15928, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [469, 437, 444, 473, 495, 447, 472, 470, 432, 465, 847, 483, 443, 429, 452, 436, 438, 526, 424, 492, 491, 428, 475, 435, 440, 493, 849, 474, 426, 446, 494, 434, 490, 486], "Excused": [846]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/5863"}
