BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF SOUTH DAKOTA: Section 1. That \u00a7 58-18B-1 be amended to read as follows: 58-18B-1. Terms used in this chapter mean: (1) \"Actuarial certification,\" a written statement by a member of the American Academy of Actuaries or other individual approved by the director that a small employer carrier is in compliance with the provisions of this chapter, based upon the person's examination, including a review of the appropriate records and of the actuarial assumptions and methods used by the carrier in establishing premium rates for applicable health benefit plans; (2) \"Base premium rate,\" the lowest premium rate charged or which could have been charged for each class of business for a rating period under a rating system for that class of business, by the small employer carrier to small employers with similar case characteristics for health benefit plans with the same or similar coverage; (3) \"Carrier,\" any person who provides health insurance in this state. In this chapter, carrier includes a licensed insurance company, a prepaid hospital or medical service plan, a health maintenance organization, a multiple employer welfare arrangement, or any person providing a plan of health insurance subject to state insurance regulation; (4) \"Case characteristics,\" demographic or other relevant characteristics of a small employer, as determined by a small employer carrier, which are considered by the carrier for the determination of premium rates.

The term includes any sole proprietor, any partner, and any independent contractor, if the sole proprietor, partner, or independent contractor is included as an employee under a health benefit plan of a small employer, but does not include any employee who works less than thirty hours or on a temporary or substitute basis; (16) \"Employee,\" has the meaning given such term under Section 3(6) of Title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) as amended to January 1, 2001; (18) (17) \"Health benefit plan,\" any hospital or medical policy or certificate, hospital or medical service plan, or health maintenance organization subscriber contract.

Section 2. That \u00a7 58-18B-17 be amended to read as follows: 58-18B-17. The premium rates for an individual covered in a small employer plan may not exceed the premium rate for any other individual covered under the same small employer carrier because of age alone by a factor of 3:1. A small employer carrier may not require any individual to pay any premium or contribution that is greater than that for a similarly situated individual enrolled in the plan. Nothing in this section prohibits a group health plan, and a health insurance issuer offering group health insurance coverage, from establishing premium discounts or rebates or modifying otherwise applicable copayments or deductibles in return for adherence to programs of health promotion or disease prevention. Section 3. That \u00a7 58-18B-20 be amended to read as follows: 58-18B-20. A small employer carrier shall issue health benefit plans to any small employer that applies for a plan and agrees to make the required premium payments and to satisfy the other reasonable provisions of the health benefit plan not inconsistent with this chapter. If, on the first day of the plan year, a small employer plan has fewer than two participants who are current employees, the carrier is not required to issue a policy to the small employer. A small employer carrier may apply reasonable criteria in determining whether to accept a small employer into a particular class of business if: (1) The criteria are not related to the health status or claim experience of the small employer; (2) The criteria are applied consistently to all small employers applying for coverage in the class of business; and (3) The small employer carrier provides for the acceptance of all eligible small employers into one or more classes of business. The provisions of this section do not apply to a class of business into which the small employer carrier is no longer enrolling new small businesses. If the director determines that all carriers in the small employer market have met the two percent threshold, the threshold shall, upon order of the director, be expanded an additional two percent. The threshold shall be expanded in additional two percent increments if all small employer carriers meet the previous threshold. No small employer carrier is required to issue coverage to any small employer if the small employers who are at high-risk constitute two percent of that carrier's earned premium on an annual basis from small employer health benefit plans. The director may promulgate rules pursuant to chapter 1-26 to determine which policies may be used to determine the two percent threshold, the procedures involved, and the applicable time frames. In making that determination, the director shall develop a method designed to limit the number of high risk groups to which any one carrier may be required to issue coverage. Section 4. That \u00a7 58-18B-25 be amended to read as follows: 58-18B-25. In applying minimum participation requirements with respect to a small employer, no a small employer carrier may consider employees or dependents who have creditable coverage in determining whether the applicable percentage of participation is met. With respect to a small employer with between two and ten eligible employees, a small employer carrier may consider employees or dependents who have coverage under another health benefit plan sponsored by the small employer in applying minimum participation requirements. Creditable coverage does not include individual coverage. If any employee or dependent with other creditable coverage is to be considered towards calculating the applicable percentage of participation, the employee or dependent shall be counted as participating in the plan. Section 5. That \u00a7 58-18B-29 be repealed. 58-18B-29. No later than July 1, 1995, the Governor shall appoint a Health Benefit Plan Committee. The committee shall consist of nine members and shall be composed of the chairperson of the House Commerce Committee or a designee, the chairperson of the Senate Commerce Committee or a designee, the representatives of carriers, small employers and employees, health care providers, and agents. The committee shall recommend the form and level of coverages to be made available by small employer carriers pursuant to \u00a7 \u00a7 58-18B-20 to 58-18B-28, inclusive. The initial committee members shall be appointed as follows: four of the members to serve a term of two years and three of the members to serve a term of three years. Subsequent committee members shall serve for a term of three years. Not all committee members may be of the same political party. A vacancy on the committee shall be filled by the Governor for the unexpired term. A committee member may be removed by the Governor for cause. Section 6. That \u00a7 58-18B-31 be repealed. 58-18B-31. The plan recommended by the committee may include cost containment features such as: (1) Utilization review of health care services, including review of medical necessity of hospital and physician services; (2) Case management; (3) Selective contracting with hospitals, physicians, and other health care providers; (4) Reasonable benefit differentials applicable to providers that participate or do not participate in arrangements using restricted network provisions; and (5) Other managed care provisions. Managed care standards or guidelines of care limiting access to or care by any provider may be adopted only after reasonable consideration as to professional standards of such providers described in \u00a7 58-17-54 and only after consultation with the licensing boards governing the providers described in \u00a7 58-17-54 to be reviewed or screened. Section 7. That \u00a7 58-18B-32 be repealed. 58-18B-32. The committee shall submit the health benefit plans described in \u00a7 \u00a7 58-18B-30 and 58-18B-31 to the director for approval within one hundred eighty days after the appointment of the committee. After approval, the director may ask the committee to review the standard and basic plans for recommendations on their modification. Any modifications recommended are subject to the approval of the director. Section 8. That \u00a7 58-18B-55 be amended to read as follows: 58-18B-55. Any policy or certificate of specified disease, short-term hospital-surgical care of six months or less duration, hospital confinement indemnity, limited benefit health insurance, or other policy or certificate that provide benefits less than that of a major medical plan that is offered to a small employer in this state is exempt from the provisions of this chapter only if the carrier offering the policy or certificate at the time of filing for policy form approval, submits a statement certifying that policies or certificates described in this section are being offered and marketed as supplemental health insurance or as individual health benefit plans of six-month duration or less and not renewable, and not as a substitute for hospital or medical expense insurance or major medical insurance. For policy forms approved prior to July 1, 1998, the carrier shall submit such a statement with the director. For purposes of this section a major medical policy is any policy which provides benefits which are actuarially equivalent to or exceed the basic plan as was approved pursuant to \u00a7 58-18B-32 and adopted by rule by the director pursuant to chapter 1-26 . Policies which are not certified pursuant to this section and which are not major medical policies may not be used as a substitute for major medical policies and must provide for adequate disclosure of the scope of the benefits contained therein."}, {"bill_id": 16144, "bill_version_id": 90510, "bill_version": "Enrolled", "bill_version_date": "2001-02-22T09:26:41-06:00", "bill_text": ""}],
