Section 2. That the code be amended by adding a NEW SECTION to read: Except as provided in section 3 of this Act, a student journalist may exercise freedom of expression in school-sponsored media. The freedom provided in this section is not limited by the fact that the school-sponsored media is supported financially by a school or school district or by use of facilities owned by the school district or if the media is produced in conjunction with a class in which the student journalist is enrolled. Section 3. That the code be amended by adding a NEW SECTION to read: The freedom of expression provided in section 2 of this Act does not authorize or protect any school-sponsored media that: (1) Is libelous or slanderous; (2) Constitutes an unwarranted invasion of privacy; (3) Violates a federal or state law; or (4) Creates the imminent danger of inciting students to violate a law or a school rule, or to materially and substantially disrupt the orderly operation of the school. Section 4. That the code be amended by adding a NEW SECTION to read: No school district employee may be dismissed, suspended, disciplined, reassigned, transferred, or otherwise retaliated against solely for acting to protect a student engaged in conduct authorized by this Act or refusing to infringe upon conduct that is protected by this Act, by S.D.

That the code be amended by adding a NEW SECTION to read: Nothing in this Act authorizes the prior restraint of any school-sponsored media. However, a school may restrain the distribution of content in school-sponsored media if the content is determined to be in conflict with section 3 of this Act, and if the school administration provides lawful justification for the restraint without undue delay."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 8580, "action_date": "2018-01-30T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 48180, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/48180.pdf", "status_text": "First read in House and referred to", "journal_page": 223, "committee_id_action": 396, "committee_id_assigned": 384, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 8580, "action_date": "2018-02-07T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 48676, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/48676.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 384, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 8580, "action_date": "2018-02-07T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 48844, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/48844.pdf", "status_text": "Do Pass", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 384, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "F", "vote": {"vote_id": 25481, "president_vote": null, "Nay": [1424, 1285, 1296, 1308, 1236, 1311, 1214, 1257, 1317, 1286, 1265], "Excused": [1313], "Yea": [1256, 1305, 1266]}}, {"bill_id": 8580, "action_date": "2018-02-07T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 48844, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/48844.pdf", "status_text": "Deferred to the 41st legislative day", "journal_page": 365, "committee_id_action": 384, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 25484, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [1424, 1285, 1296, 1308, 1236, 1311, 1214, 1257, 1317, 1286, 1265], "Excused": [1313], "Nay": [1256, 1305, 1266]}}], "rss_feed": "https://sdlegislature.gov/api/Bills/RSS/8580"}
