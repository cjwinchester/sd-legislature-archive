This includes the following: (1) Monitoring and, as appropriate, conducting audits to assure that the contracted function is properly performed; and (2) Annually obtaining a certification from a senior manager who has responsibility for the contracted function that the manager has a reasonable basis to represent, and does represent, that the function is properly performed. An insurer is not required to include in its system of supervision an insurance producer's recommendations to consumers of products other than the annuities offered by the insurer. Section 9. That chapter 58-33A be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: No insurance producer may dissuade, or attempt to dissuade, a consumer from: (1) Truthfully responding to an insurer's request for confirmation of suitability information; (2) Filing a complaint; or (3) Cooperating with the investigation of a complaint. Section 10. That \u00a7 58-33A-25 be amended to read as follows: 58-33A-25. If the director finds that the Conduct Rules of the National Association of Securities Dealers Financial Industry Regulatory Authority meet or exceed the requirements of \u00a7\u00a7 58-33A-16 to 58-33A-24, inclusive, and this Act, then any recommendations made for variable annuities that comply with the Conduct Rules of the National Association of Securities Dealers Financial Industry Regulatory Authority meet the requirements of \u00a7\u00a7 58-33A-16 to 58-33A-24, inclusive, and this Act. For this section to apply, an insurer shall: (1) Monitor the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority member broker-dealer using information collected in the normal course of an insurer's business; and (2) Provide to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority member broker-dealer information and reports that are reasonably appropriate to assist the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority member broker-dealer to maintain its supervision system. Section 11. That chapter 58-33A be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: No insurance producer may solicit the sale of an annuity product unless the insurance producer has adequate knowledge of the product to recommend the annuity and the insurance producer is in compliance with the insurer's standards for product training. An insurance producer may rely on insurer-provided product-specific training standards and materials to comply with this section. An insurance producer who engages in the sale of annuity products shall complete a one-time four credit training course approved by the director and provided by a director-approved education provider. Any insurance producer who holds a life insurance line of authority on the effective date of this Act and who desires to sell annuities shall complete the requirements of this section within six months after the effective date of this Act. Any person who obtains a life insurance line of authority on or after the effective date of this Act may not engage in the sale of annuities unless the annuity training course required under this section has been completed. The minimum length of the training required under this section shall be sufficient to qualify for at least four continuing education credits, but may be longer. The training required under this section shall include information on the following subjects: (1) The types of annuities and various classifications of annuities; (2) Identification of the parties to an annuity; (3) How fixed, variable, and indexed annuity contract provisions affect consumers; (4) The application of income taxation of qualified and nonqualified annuities; (5) The primary uses of annuities; and (6) Appropriate sales practices, replacement, and disclosure requirements. Section 12. That chapter 58-33A be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: Each course provider intending to comply with section 11 of this Act shall cover all subjects listed in section 11 of this Act. No provider of such course may present any marketing information or provide training on sales techniques or provide specific information about a particular insurer's products. Additional subjects may be offered in conjunction with and in addition to the required subjects. Each provider of an annuity training course intending to comply with section 11 of this Act shall register as a continuing education provider in this state and shall comply with the rules applicable to insurance producer continuing education courses as set forth in chapter 58-30. An annuity training course may be conducted and completed by classroom or self-study methods. Each provider of annuity training shall comply with the reporting requirements and shall issue certificates of completion in accordance with chapter 58-30. The satisfaction of the training requirements of another state that are substantially similar to the provisions of this section satisfy the training requirements of this section and section 11 of this Act. Section 13. That chapter 58-33A be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: An insurer shall verify that an insurance producer has completed the annuity training course required pursuant to section 11 of this Act before allowing the producer to sell an annuity product for that insurer. An insurer may satisfy its responsibility under this section by obtaining certificates of completion of the training course or obtaining reports provided by a director-sponsored database system or vendor or from a reasonably reliable commercial database vendor that has a reporting arrangement with an approved insurance education provider. Section 14. That \u00a7 58-33A-26 be amended to read as follows: 58-33A-26. An insurer is responsible for compliance with \u00a7\u00a7 58-33A-13 to 58-33A-27, inclusive, and this Act. The director may order: (1) An insurer to take reasonably appropriate corrective action for any consumer harmed by the insurer's, or by its insurance producer's, violation of \u00a7\u00a7 58-33A-13 to 58-33A-27, inclusive; (2) An insurance producer to take reasonably appropriate corrective action for any consumer harmed by the insurance producer's violation of \u00a7\u00a7 58-33A-13 to 58-33A-27, inclusive; and (3) A general agency or independent agency that employs or contracts with an insurance producer to sell, or solicit the sale, of annuities to consumers, to take reasonably appropriate corrective action for any consumer harmed by the insurance producer's violation of \u00a7\u00a7 58-33A-13 to 58-33A-27, inclusive. Any violation of \u00a7 58-33A-16, 58-33A-17, or 58-33A-19 subjects the insurer, insurance producer, or general agency or independent agency to suspension, revocation, refusal to renew a license, or to a monetary penalty as provided for under this title. However, the penalty may be reduced or eliminated, according to a schedule adopted by the director, if corrective action for the consumer is taken promptly after a violation is discovered or the violation was not part of a pattern or practice. Section 15. That \u00a7 58-33A-21 be repealed. 58-33A-21. A general agent and independent agency either shall adopt a system established by an insurer to supervise recommendations of its insurance producers that is reasonably designed to achieve compliance with \u00a7\u00a7 58-33A-13 to 58-33A-27, inclusive, or shall establish and maintain such a system, including: (1) Maintaining written procedures; and (2) Conducting periodic reviews of records that are reasonably designed to assist in detecting and preventing violations of \u00a7\u00a7 58-33A-13 to 58-33A-27, inclusive.

An insurer may contract with a third party, including a general agent or independent agency, to establish and maintain a system of supervision as required by \u00a7 58-33A-20 with respect to insurance producers under contract with or employed by the third party. An insurer shall make reasonable inquiry to assure that the third party contracting under this section is performing the functions required under \u00a7 58-33A-20 and shall take such action as is reasonable under the circumstances to enforce the contractual obligation to perform the functions. An insurer may comply with its obligation to make reasonable inquiry by doing all of the following: (1) The insurer annually obtains a certification from a third party senior manager who has responsibility for the delegated functions that the manager has a reasonable basis to represent, and does represent, that the third party is performing the required functions; and (2) The insurer, based on reasonable selection criteria, periodically selects third parties contracting under this section for a review to determine whether the third parties are performing the required functions. The insurer shall perform those procedures to conduct the review that are reasonable under the circumstances. Any insurer that contracts with a third party pursuant to this section and that complies with the requirements to supervise in this section has fulfilled its responsibilities under \u00a7 58-33A-20. Section 17. That \u00a7 58-33A-23 be repealed. 58-33A-23. No insurer, general agent, or independent agency is required by \u00a7 58-33A-20 or 58-33A-21 to: (1) Review, or provide for review of, all insurance producer solicited transactions; or (2) Include in its system of supervision an insurance producer's recommendations to consumers of products other than the annuities offered by the insurer, general agent, or independent agency.

Section 18. That \u00a7 58-33A-24 be repealed. 58-33A-24. No person may provide a certification under subdivision \u00a7 58-33A-22(1) unless: (1) The person is a senior manager with responsibility for the delegated functions; and (2) The person has a reasonable basis for making the certification. Section 19. That \u00a7 58-33A-1 be amended to read as follows: 58-33A-1. This chapter applies to all individual and group health policies which are solicited or sold in this state that are subject to chapters 58-15, 58-16, 58-17, 58-18, 58-18B, 58-37A, 58-38, 58-39, 58-40, and 58-41.
