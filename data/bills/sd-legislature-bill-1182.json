WHEREAS, schools and school-sponsored athletic events are attended daily across South Dakota by thousands of adults and students; and WHEREAS, one thousand two hundred Americians die every day from sudden cardiac arrest, totaling approximately four hundred fifty thousand victims each year; and WHEREAS, sudden cardiac arrest is the leading cause of death in young athletes; and WHEREAS, we know there are a significant number of young athletes with undetected, underlying heart disease that predisposes them to sudden cardiac arrest, especially at times of exertion; and WHEREAS, it generally takes six to twelve minutes for the average U.S. emergency medical services team to arrive at the scene of a medical emergency, and studies show survival rates drop seven to ten percent every minute defibrillation is delayed; and WHEREAS, out-of-hospital survival rates from sudden cardiac arrest are about five percent, yet recent studies show that up to seventy percent of victims survive when AEDs are accessible and used within three to four minutes; and WHEREAS, results from the largest-ever clinical trial studying the outcome of public access to defibrillation were presented in 2006 at the American Heart Association's Annual Scientific Sessions, and the data indicated that the number of survivors from sudden cardiac arrest in public locations approximately doubled when lay persons called 911 and administered CPR and AED therapy; and WHEREAS, the presence of AEDs in schools improves public awareness of what sudden cardiac arrest is, what AEDs are, and the importance of immediate bystander action: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the House of Representatives of the Eighty- fourth Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the Senate concurring therein, that the South Dakota Legislature encourages all South Dakota schools to place a sufficient number of Automated External Defibrillators (AEDs) in their facilities, at their athletic fields, and with their athletic staff, and to adopt a medical emergency response plan that includes AED use."}, {"bill_id": 1182, "bill_version_id": 7500, "bill_version": "Enrolled", "bill_version_date": "2009-02-17T09:44:48.85-06:00", "bill_text": ""}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 1182, "action_date": "2009-01-29T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 6340, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/6340.pdf", "status_text": "First read and referred to", "journal_page": 183, "committee_id_action": 56, "committee_id_assigned": 45, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 1182, "action_date": "2009-02-10T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 6786, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/6786.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": 0, "committee_id_action": 45, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 1182, "action_date": "2009-02-10T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 7099, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/7099.pdf", "status_text": "Adopt Resolution", "journal_page": 322, "committee_id_action": 45, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 3794, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [716, 666, 715, 692, 730, 737, 683, 722, 665, 681, 735, 718, 646]}}, {"bill_id": 1182, "action_date": "2009-02-11T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 7246, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/7246.pdf", "status_text": "Adopt Resolution", "journal_page": 341, "committee_id_action": 56, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 3925, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [716, 720, 666, 688, 676, 670, 726, 715, 699, 635, 692, 651, 643, 712, 709, 660, 706, 725, 693, 724, 727, 721, 652, 737, 672, 698, 717, 738, 654, 711, 719, 683, 695, 696, 722, 645, 637, 665, 687, 678, 650, 646, 668, 639, 735, 679, 734, 714, 731, 736, 713, 710, 728, 657, 641, 658, 647, 691, 723, 718, 684, 732, 707, 681], "Excused": [674, 708, 730, 729], "Nay": [644, 733]}}, {"bill_id": 1182, "action_date": "2009-02-12T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 7359, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/7359.pdf", "status_text": "First Reading", "journal_page": 386, "committee_id_action": 54, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 1182, "action_date": "2009-02-13T12:30:00-06:00", "document_id": 7448, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/7448.pdf", "status_text": "Concurred in Resolution", "journal_page": 405, "committee_id_action": 54, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 4064, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [653, 680, 682, 685, 702, 649, 700, 655, 673, 663, 677, 675, 634, 697, 659, 690, 636, 667, 661, 686, 701, 662, 703, 664, 638, 648, 640, 689, 694, 705, 642, 671], "Excused": [704, 656, 669]}}]}
