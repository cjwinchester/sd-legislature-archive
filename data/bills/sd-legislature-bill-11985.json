WHEREAS, society benefits from a well-educated citizenry; and WHEREAS, research demonstrates that children who participate in high-quality early education programs have better higher-order thinking and attention skills, as well as better executive functions, such as self-control, decision-making skill and the ability to connect social, emotional, and cognitive processes; and WHEREAS, well-regarded studies have shown that high-quality early education programs both increase the likelihood that children will gain higher levels of cognitive and social skills and become successful students and productive citizens and reduce the chances that they will drop out of high school, become dependent on welfare, or be incarcerated; and WHEREAS, studies indicate that children exposed to high-quality early education programs have better oral literacy, have better reading, writing, and mathematics abilities, require fewer remedial services, experience less grade retention, and have a higher likelihood of economic productivity and social stability in adulthood; and WHEREAS, in order to address the needs of all children so they can meet high standards and in order to close the objectionably large achievement gap between advantaged and disadvantaged students, this state must focus its attention on issues related to early education and school readiness; and WHEREAS, high quality childcare services remain unaffordable for most working families in this state; and WHEREAS, the lack of access to high-quality early education programs is a major problem that affects nearly every working family in this state, whether lower or middle class, and is likely to become more acute as the numbers of working mothers and fathers increase: NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, by the House of Representatives of the Ninety-Fifth Legislature of the State of South Dakota, the Senate concurring therein, that the Legislature supports the creation of an Early Education Advisory Council to ensure the maximization of educational opportunities for all students across this state."}], "amendments": [], "fiscal_notes": [], "action_log": [{"bill_id": 11985, "action_date": "2020-02-06T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 66674, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/66674.pdf", "status_text": "First Reading House", "journal_page": 208, "committee_id_action": 480, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 11985, "action_date": "2020-02-19T14:00:00-06:00", "document_id": 67894, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/67894.pdf", "status_text": "Referred to", "journal_page": 313, "committee_id_action": 480, "committee_id_assigned": 464, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 11985, "action_date": "2020-02-26T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 68537, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/68537.pdf", "status_text": "Scheduled for hearing", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 464, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "N", "vote": {}}, {"bill_id": 11985, "action_date": "2020-02-26T07:45:00-06:00", "document_id": 68538, "document_url": "https://mylrc.sdlegislature.gov/api/Documents/68538.pdf", "status_text": "Tabled", "journal_page": null, "committee_id_action": 464, "committee_id_assigned": null, "result": "P", "vote": {"vote_id": 33843, "president_vote": null, "Yea": [1710, 1699, 1738, 1747, 1722, 1671, 1674, 1688, 1692, 1755, 1662, 1664, 1681, 1728], "Excused": [1683]}}]}
