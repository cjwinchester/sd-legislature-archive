The members of the partnership or association shall have been bona fide residents of the state for one year or more immediately prior to bidding upon the contract. A foreign corporation licensed pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 47-1A-1501 to 47-1A-1532, inclusive, is not a resident as defined by this section if the state or country in which it is organized enforces or has a preference for resident bidders; (27) \"Reverse auction,\" a purchasing process in which bidders submit bids in competing to sell supplies, services, or public improvement projects in an open environment via the internet; (28) \"Sealed bid or proposal,\" a response to an invitation for bids or request for proposals submitted in a manner where the contents of the bid or proposal cannot be opened or viewed before the date and time of the formal opening without leaving evidence that the bid or proposal has been opened or viewed; (29) \"Services,\" furnishing of labor, time, or effort by a contractor not involving the delivery of a specific end product; (30) \"Supplies,\" any property, including equipment, materials, and printing; (31) \"Surety,\" a bond or undertaking executed by a surety company authorized to do business in the State of South Dakota and countersigned by an agent of the company resident in the State of South Dakota. However, nothing in this subdivision requires countersignature of a bid bond. Section 3. Unless otherwise authorized by law, the provisions of this Act, inclusive, apply to all contracts issued by any purchasing agency. Section 4. Unless otherwise authorized by law, each contract for supplies, services, and construction shall be awarded by one of the following methods: (1) Competitive sealed bids as provided in section 6 of this Act; (2) Competitive sealed proposals as provided in sections 7 and 8 of this Act; (3) Reverse auction as provided in sections 9 and 10 of this Act; (4) Small purchases as provided in section 14 of this Act; (5) Sole source procurement as provided in section 11 of this Act; or (6) Emergency procurement as provided in section 12 of this Act. Section 5. Contracts shall be awarded by the use of competitive sealed bids except as otherwise provided in this Act. Section 6. The following procedures apply to the use of competitive sealed bids: (1) Public notice of the invitation for bids shall be given pursuant to section 17 of this Act; (2) The invitation for bids shall include a purchase description, and all contractual terms and conditions applicable to the procurement; (3) A bid may be submitted either manually or electronically in a manner authorized by the purchasing agency; (4) Each bid shall be opened publicly in the presence of one or more witnesses at the time and place designated in the invitation for bids. The amount of each bid, and such other relevant information as may be specified, together with the name of each bidder shall be recorded. The record and each bid shall be open to public inspection; (5) Each bid shall be unconditionally accepted without alteration or correction, except as authorized in this section. Each bid shall be evaluated based on the requirements set forth in the invitation for bids, which may include criteria to determine acceptability such as inspection, testing, quality, workmanship, delivery, and suitability for a particular purpose. Those criteria that will affect the bid price and be considered in evaluation for award shall be objectively measurable, such as discounts, transportation costs, and total or life cycle costs. The invitation for bids shall set forth the evaluation criteria to be used. No criteria may be used in bid evaluation that are not set forth in the invitation for bids; (6) Any bid may be withdrawn by letter or by electronic communications or in person before the time specified in the advertisement therefor. The purchasing agency may allow modification of bids by mail, facsimile, or electronic notice received at the place designated in the invitation to bid not later than the time set for the opening of bids. A modification may not reveal the bid price but shall provide the addition or subtraction or the modification so that the final prices or terms will not be known to the purchasing agency until the sealed bid is opened. A modification may not be withdrawn after the time set for the opening of bids. Each modification shall be confirmed in writing by the successful bidder before award of the contract. No bid made may be changed or altered by telephone. After bid opening, no change in bid prices or other provisions of bids prejudicial to the interest of the purchasing agency or fair competition is permitted. The purchasing agency may waive technical irregularities in the bid or proposal of the low bidder or offeror which irregularities do not alter the price, quality, or quantity of the services, or items of tangible personal property bid or offered. Any decision to permit the correction or withdrawal of a bid, or to cancel an award or a contract based on a bid mistake, shall be supported by a written determination made by the purchasing agency, and included in the bid file; (7) The contract shall be awarded with reasonable promptness by written notice to the lowest responsible and responsive bidder whose bid meets the requirements and criteria set forth in the invitation for bids. The purchasing agency may reject any and all bids and readvertise for bids if none of the bids are satisfactory, or if the purchasing agency believes an agreement has been entered into by the bidders to prevent competition. If the low bidder is not responsible or the bid is not made in accordance with the requirements of this Act or the low bid is withdrawn, the bid of the next lowest responsible bidder may be accepted; (8) If it is considered impractical to initially prepare a purchase description to support an award based on price, an invitation for bids may be issued requesting the submission of unpriced offers to be followed by an invitation for bids limited to those bidders whose offers have been qualified under the criteria set forth in the first solicitation; (9) If, after advertising for bids, no firm bids are received, the purchasing agency may negotiate a contract for the purchase of the supplies, services, or public improvement projects at the most advantageous price, if the specifications of the original bid are met; (10) If two or more competitive sealed bids submitted are identical in price and product quality, the bids are the low bid, and no resident bidder preference is applicable, the purchasing agency may: (a) Award the bid by lottery to one of the identical low bidders; or (b) Reject all the bids and resolicit bids for the required supplies, services, or public improvement. Section 7. A contract may be entered into by competitive sealed proposals if the purchasing agency determines in writing that the use of competitive sealed bids is either not practicable or not advantageous. Section 8. The procedures for issuing a contract through competitive sealed proposals are as follows: (1) The proposals shall be solicited through a request for proposals. The request for proposals shall state the relative importance of price and other factors, if any; (2) Public notice of the request for proposals shall be given pursuant to section 17 of this Act; (3) A proposal may be submitted either manually or electronically in a manner authorized by the purchasing agency; (4) Each proposal shall be opened so as to avoid disclosure of contents to competing offerors during the process of negotiation. A register of proposals shall be prepared documenting the name and address of each offeror and identifying each offeror awarded a contract. The register shall be open for public inspection after contract award; (5) As provided in the request for proposals, a discussion may be conducted with any responsible offeror who submitted a proposal determined to be reasonably susceptible of being selected for award for the purpose of clarification to assure full understanding of, and responsiveness to, the solicitation requirements. Each offeror shall be accorded fair and equal treatment with respect to any opportunity for discussion and revision of a proposal. A revision may be permitted after a submission and prior to an award for the purpose of obtaining the best and final offer. In conducting any discussion, there may be no disclosure of any information derived from any proposal submitted by a competing offeror; (6) An award shall be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal conforms to the solicitation and is determined in writing to be the most advantageous to the purchasing agency taking into consideration price and the evaluation factors set forth in the request for proposals. No other factors or criteria may be used in the evaluation. The contract file shall contain the basis on which the award is made. Written notice of the award of a contract to the successful offeror shall be promptly given to each offeror. The purchasing agency may reject any and all proposals and readvertise for proposals if none of the proposals are satisfactory, or if the purchasing agency believes any agreement has been entered into by the offerors to prevent competition; and (7) This section does not apply to state professional service contracts issued pursuant to sections 112 to 121, inclusive, of this Act. Section 9. A reverse auction may be used by a purchasing agency for the purchase of supplies or services. Prior to conducting a reverse auction, the purchasing agency shall: (1) Pre-qualify bidders to participate in the reverse auction event. Pre-qualification shall be completed by issuing an invitation to qualify to any bidder registered on the state bidder list, and any other vendor that requests a copy of the invitation to qualify. The factors used to determine if a vendor qualifies for the reverse auction shall be clearly stated in the invitation to qualify. No other factors may be used to qualify a vendor for the reverse auction than those stated in the invitation to qualify; (2) The purchasing agency shall advertise the invitation to qualify in the same manner as required for competitive sealed bids or competitive sealed proposals. The invitation to qualify shall be in the form of a competitive sealed bid or competitive sealed proposal. Public notice of the invitation shall be given pursuant to section 17 of this Act; (3) The purchasing agency shall notify each responding vendor as to whether the vendor is invited to the reverse auction. The purchasing agency may not disclose to the public or to any other vendor, the name of any vendor that has been invited to the reverse auction until after the reverse auction has occurred; (4) The purchasing agency may limit the number of bidders to be selected to participate in the reverse auction; (5) Each bidder shall directly participate in the reverse auction. The purchasing agency may not accept any bid via phone, fax, or some other alternate method on behalf of a bidder that is unable to enter a bid on the internet for whatever reason; (6) Any clarification, negotiation, and acceptance of any specification, requirement, and term and condition shall occur before the purchasing agency decides whether to invite a vendor to the reverse auction. After the reverse auction, the purchasing agency may permit a change only with the limitation that the change does not alter the scope or content of the original solicitation to a degree that will affect the justification that was used to eliminate any other vendor from being invited to the reverse auction; (7) During any reverse auction, the on-line view of any bid presented to any bidder may not indicate names, aliases, or identifiers of any kind as to who has placed a particular bid. Each bidder shall only be able to see the amount of the bid; (8) If a bidder loses the ability to place a bid during an auction for any reason, the auction shall be suspended as soon as practical and remain suspended until each bidder regains the ability to place bids via the internet auction site. If no resolution to the problem is imminent, the reverse auction may be terminated and rescheduled by the purchasing agency for a later date. In addition, the auction may be suspended or terminated for any reason by the purchasing agency or the reverse auction service provider. Upon resuming an auction after a suspension, the time remaining shall be the time remaining when the auction was suspended or ten minutes, whichever is greater; (9) In conducting a reverse auction, the agency may establish an extension activation period, which is the number of minutes before the end of the auction during which, if a bid is received, the auction will be extended by a pre-defined number of additional minutes. The minimum extension activation period that may be used is ten minutes; and (10) After the reverse auction is completed, any award shall be made in accordance with the requirements for competitive sealed bids or competitive sealed proposals. Section 10. Only the Bureau of Administration may conduct any reverse auction on behalf of a state agency. Section 11. A contract may be awarded for supplies or services without competition if the purchasing agency determines in writing that the supplies or services are of such a unique nature that the contractor selected is clearly and justifiably the only practicable source to provide the supplies or services. The determination that the contractor selected is justifiably the sole source shall be based on either the uniqueness of the supplies or services or the sole availability at the location required. In such cases, the purchasing agency shall conduct negotiations, including price, delivery, and quantity to obtain the most advantageous price and shall include the written verification of the sole source in the contract file. This section does not apply to construction services or construction equipment. Section 12. A purchasing agency may make or authorize others to make an emergency procurement without advertising the procurement if there exists a threat to public health, welfare, or safety and if the emergency procurement is made with such competition as is practicable under the circumstances. A written determination of the basis for the emergency and for the selection of the particular contractor shall be included in the contract file. Section 13. The purchasing agency shall maintain a record listing each contract made under sole source procurement and emergency procurement for a minimum of five years. The record shall contain: (1) Each contractor's name; (2) The amount and type of each contract; and (3) A listing of the supplies procured under each contract. Section 14. Unless otherwise specified by statute, any procurement not exceeding ten thousand dollars may be made in accordance with procedures established by the purchasing agency. However, no procurement may be artificially divided to constitute a small purchase under this section. Section 15. An invitation for bids, a request for proposals, or other solicitation may be canceled, or any or all bids or proposals may be rejected in whole or in part as may be specified in the solicitation, if the purchasing agency determines it is in the best interests of the agency. The reasons for the cancellation or rejection shall be made part of the contract file. Section 16. There is hereby created a centralized public bid exchange. The Bureau of Administration shall establish the exchange either within the bureau or within another public or private organization. The purpose of the exchange is to facilitate the publishing of official state and political subdivision bids to provide greater notice to bidders and to the state and its political subdivisions. The exchange shall maintain a list of all state bids and proposals and all bids and proposals provided by political subdivisions which participate in the exchange. The exchange shall set and charge each bidder, offeror, or political subdivision or both a fee for participation in the exchange to defray the cost of administering the exchange. Section 17. If the purchasing agency intends to enter into a contract for the construction of a new building or for the remodeling or addition to an existing building that involves the expenditure of fifty thousand dollars or more, a contract for any other public improvement that involves the expenditure of twenty-five thousand dollars or more, or a contract for the purchase of supplies that involves the expenditure of ten thousand dollars or more, the purchasing agency shall advertise for bids or proposals. The advertisement shall appear as a legal notice in the appointed legal newspaper. The advertisement shall be printed at least twice, with the first publication at least ten days before opening of bids or the deadline for the submission of proposals. The first publication shall be in each official newspaper of the purchasing agency, and the second publication may be in any legal newspaper of the state chosen by the purchasing agency. If the purchasing agency has no official newspaper, the first publication shall be made in a legal newspaper with general circulation in the jurisdiction of the purchasing agency to be selected by the contracting corporation. The advertisement shall state the time and place where the bids will be opened or the deadline for the submission of proposals. In each notice, the purchasing agency shall reserve the right to reject any or all bids or proposals. If a purchasing agency lists an invitation for bids or request for proposals on the centralized bid exchange pursuant to section 16 of this Act, the purchasing agency need not make the publication required by this section. Section 18. After receiving notice of a contract award, the successful bidder or offeror shall enter into a contract with the purchasing agency within the time specified in the invitation for bids or request for proposals. If any bidder or offeror fails to enter into a contract within the time specified, the contract may be awarded to the next lowest responsive bidder or offeror for the same kind of work and material, unless all bids or proposals are rejected. The defaulting bidder or offeror shall be responsible for the difference in price. Section 19. If any successful bidder or offeror fails to fulfill the conditions of an awarded contract, the purchasing agency may proceed to recover from the defaulting party whatever damages may have been sustained as a result of the default. Section 20. No state officer or employee who approves, awards, or administers a contract with the state, involving the expenditure of public funds or the sale or lease of state property, may have an interest in a contract that is within the scope of the officer's or employee's official duties. This prohibition includes any officer or employee who, in his or her official capacity, recommends the approval or award of the contract or who supervises a person who approves, awards, or administers the contract. This prohibition does not include any officer who serves without compensation or who may be paid per diem pursuant to \u00a7 4-7-10.4. Any contract made in violation of this section is void. Any officer or employee who knowingly violates this section is guilty of a Class 2 misdemeanor. Section 21. Any specification shall seek to promote overall economy for the purposes intended and encourage competition in satisfying the purchasing agency's needs, and may not be unduly restrictive. Brand name or equal specifications may be used if the purchasing agency determines in writing that: (1) No other design or performance specification or qualified products list is available; (2) Time does not permit the preparation of another form of purchase description, not including a brand name specification; (3) The nature of the product or the nature of the purchasing agency's requirements makes use of a brand name or equal specification suitable for the procurement; or (4) Use of a brand name or equal specification is in the purchasing agency's best interests. Section 22. Brand name or equal specifications shall seek to designate three, or as many different brands as are practicable, as \"or equal\" references and shall further state that substantially equivalent products to those designated will be considered for award. Unless the purchasing agency determines in writing that the essential characteristics of the brand names included in the specifications are commonly known in the industry or trade, brand name or equal specifications shall include a description of the particular design, functional, or performance characteristics which are required. If a brand name or equal specification is used in a solicitation, the solicitation shall contain explanatory language that the use of a brand name is for the purpose of describing the standard of quality, performance, and characteristics desired and is not intended to limit or restrict competition. Section 23. Brand name specification may be used only if the purchasing agency makes a written determination that only the identified brand name item or items will satisfy the agency's needs. The agency shall seek to identify sources from which the designated brand name item or items can be obtained and shall solicit such sources to achieve whatever degree of price competition is practicable. If only one source can supply the requirement, the procurement shall be made under the sole source procurement provisions of section 11 of this Act. Section 24. Each contract shall be in writing and shall be signed on behalf of the purchasing agency by the authorized officials. Section 25. The provisions of this Act do not apply to: (1) Any highway construction contract entered into by the Department of Transportation; (2) Any contract for the purchase of supplies from the United States or its agencies or any contract issued by the General Services Administration; (3) Any purchase of supplies by purchasing agencies from contracts that have been awarded by any government entity by competitive sealed bids or competitive sealed proposals; (4) Any equipment repair contract; (5) Any procurement of electric power, water, or natural gas; chemical and biological products; laboratory apparatus and appliances; published books, maps, periodicals and technical pamphlets; works of art for museum and public display; medical supplies; communications technologies, computer hardware and software, peripheral equipment, and related connectivity; tableware or perishable foods; (6) Any supplies and services required for externally funded research projects at institutions under the control of the Board of Regents; (7) Any property or liability insurance or performance bonds, except that the actual procurement of any insurance or performance bonds by any department of the state government, state institution, and state agency shall be made under the supervision of the Bureau of Administration; (8) Any supplies needed by the Department of Human Services or prison industries for the manufacturing of products; (9) Any printing involving student activities, conducted by student organizations and paid for out of student fees, at institutions under the control of the Board of Regents. However, nothing in this subdivision exempts, from the requirements of this Act, purchases that involve printing for other activities at institutions under the control of the Board of Regents; (10) Any purchase of surplus property from another purchasing agency; (11) Any animals purchased; or (12) Any purchase by a school district of perishable food, raw materials used in construction or manufacture of products for resale, any contract for asbestos removal in emergency response actions, and any contract for services provided by individuals or firms for consultants, audits, legal services, architectural services and engineering, insurance, real estate services, auction services, or transportation of students. Section 26. The state auditor may stop the letting or the execution of any contract with the state, or with any state officer, commission, board, institution, or agency by serving a written notice of the order on the officer, commission, or board involved, the secretary of state, the attorney general, and on the contractor, if any, stating the grounds on which the state auditor has determined that the contract is illegal, unauthorized, or improper. Section 27. From any order or decision of the state auditor stopping execution of any contract obligation of the state, any person aggrieved or interested may appeal to the State Board of Finance at any time within twenty days after the stop order was filed with either the attorney general, the secretary of state, the state treasurer, or the department involved by serving notice of appeal on the state auditor and the Governor. The notice shall state the decision being appealed and shall ask for a hearing on the appeal. Upon receiving the notice, the Governor shall call a meeting of the State Board of Finance. The board shall consider the appeal, make a decision, enter the decision in the journal, and give notice to the appellant and the department involved. Any order of the Board of Finance as expressed in the board's decision is binding upon the state department, institution, agency, or office involved and shall be carried out accordingly. Section 28. Except for canned meat food products that are not available from a domestic source, no purchasing agency may purchase any meat food products that are the products of any foreign country or that are imported from outside the boundaries of the United States. Section 29. Any milk processor licensed pursuant to \u00a7 39-6-7, bidding any milk or milk product under a competitive bid contract, shall receive the bid contract if the processor's bid is equal to, or within five percent or less, of any other bidder who is not a licensed processor. Section 30. In awarding a contract, if all things are equal, including the price and quality of the supplies or services, a purchasing agency shall give preference: (1) To a qualified agency if the other equal low bid or proposal was submitted by a business that was not a qualified agency; (2) To a resident business if the other equal low bid or proposal was submitted by a nonresident business; (3) To a resident manufacturer if the other equal low bid or proposal was submitted by a resident business that is not a manufacturer; (4) To a resident business whose principal place of business is located in the State of South Dakota, if the other equal low bid or proposal was submitted by a resident business whose principal place of business is not located in the State of South Dakota; or (5) To a nonresident business providing or utilizing supplies or services found in South Dakota, if the other equal low bid or proposal was submitted by a nonresident business not providing or utilizing supplies or services found in South Dakota. In computing price, the cost of transportation, if any, including delivery, shall be considered. Section 31. A resident bidder shall be allowed a preference on a contract against the bid of any bidder from any other state or foreign province that enforces or has a preference for resident bidders. The amount of the preference given to the resident bidder shall be equal to the preference in the other state or foreign province. Section 32.

Except for the legislative and judicial branches and as otherwise specifically provided in this Act, the Bureau of Administration shall procure, or authorize the procurement of all supplies, services, and public improvements for state government. No claim for any such procurement may be paid unless authorization has been issued by the bureau. The governing body of all other purchasing agencies, including the legislative and judicial branches of state government, is responsible for procuring or authorizing the procurement of supplies, services, and public improvements for their respective governmental unit. Section 40. A purchasing agency may require a bond or an approved security to be submitted with any bid or proposal. No offeror or bidder may be required to leave the bond or security posted for a longer period than thirty days if the bid or proposal is not accepted. The bond or approved security of the successful offeror or bidder shall be returned upon the signing of the contract. Section 41. For any public improvement contract, a performance and payment bond is required pursuant to chapter 5-21.

The purchasing agency shall, upon request, furnish at least one copy of the plans and specifications, without charge, to each contractor resident in South Dakota who intends, in good faith, to bid upon the public improvement. The copy shall be available at the date of the first publication of the advertisement for bids. The purchasing agency may require the return of the copy at the time of the opening of the bids. Section 43. If the invitation for bids is for the construction of a public improvement, each bid shall contain a certified check or a cashier's check, for five percent of the amount of the bid. Such check shall be certified or issued by either a state or a national bank and payable to the purchasing agency or to an officer of the purchasing agency letting the contract and inviting bids.

Such bond to be issued by a surety authorized to do business in this state payable to the purchasing agency, as a guaranty that the bidder will enter into a contract with the purchasing agency, its board or officers thereof, in accordance with the terms of the letting and bid in case the bidder be awarded the contract. Section 44. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 41 of this Act, the requirement of a bid bond, certified or cashier's check, cash, or other security may be waived by the purchasing agency if the bid submitted does not exceed fifty thousand dollars. Section 45. No public servant may, directly or indirectly, require or direct a bidder on any public building or construction contract that is about to be or has been competitively bid to obtain from a particular insurer or insurance producer any surety bond or contract of insurance required in the bid or contract or required by any law, ordinance, or rule. However, the surety insurer shall be an authorized insurer under Title 58. Nothing in this section prevents any such public servant acting on behalf of the government from exercising the right to approve or reject a surety bond or contract of insurance as to its form or sufficiency. Section 46. Unless all bids presented are rejected, the lowest responsible bid shall be accepted. If the low bidder is not responsible or the bid is not made in accordance with the requirements of this Act or the low bid is withdrawn, the bid of the next lowest responsible bidder may be accepted. If the lowest responsible bid exceeds the final estimated project cost, the Bureau of Administration, acting on behalf of the state, or any other purchasing agency may negotiate with that low bidder for the construction of a public improvement or for the purchase of the supplies at the most advantageous price. Section 47. Prior to execution of a public improvement contract, a successful bidder shall certify: (1) That no more than twenty percent of the cost of labor included in the contract is being provided by nonresident subcontractors; or (2) That more then twenty percent of the cost of labor included in the contract is being provided by nonresident subcontractors because resident contractors are not available and at competitive prices.

The checks or bid bonds of all unsuccessful bidders shall be, by the purchasing agency, immediately returned to the respective makers thereof and not more than thirty days shall elapse between the opening of the bids and either the acceptance of the bid of the lowest responsible bidder or the rejection of all of the bids presented. Section 51. If a contract is based upon plans and specifications prepared by an architect or engineer, the contract's terms and conditions shall comply with the provisions provided in the \"General Conditions of the Contract for Construction,\" Fourteenth Edition, by the American Institute of Architects in effect on January 1, 2010, the \"ConsensusDOCS 200 Standard Agreement and General Conditions Between Owner and Contractor,\" by ConsensusDOCS LLC in effect January 1, 2010, or the \"Standard General Conditions of the Construction Contract,\" 1990 Edition, by the Engineer's Joint Contract Documents Committee, in effect January 1, 2010, except when in conflict with the laws of this state. However, the purchasing agency may modify or delete, on a contract by contract basis, any portion of the \"General Conditions of the Contract for Construction,\" \"ConsensusDOCS 200 Standard Agreement and General Conditions Between Owner and Contractor,\" or the \"Standard General Conditions of the Construction Contract.\" Section 52. The contract may permit progress payments, but an amount necessary to complete the improvement shall be retained from the final payment until the contract is executed in full and the public improvement completed to the satisfaction and acceptance of the purchasing agency.

The interest shall continue until the date when payment is tendered to the contractor unless delay in payment has been the result of federal participation in the contract in which event interest may not begin until thirty days after payment by the federal authority involved. If a portion of a progress payment is retained, other than the final payment, the purchasing agency shall pay to the contractor interest as set by the purchasing agency at a rate of not less than the category E rate of interest as established by \u00a7 54-3-16 on the amount retained beginning thirty days after the contractor has furnished the purchasing agency with all required records and reports and a progress inspection. Section 53. The purchasing agency may include in any contract for a public improvement provisions for the deposit of securities in lieu of sums retained from payments due a contractor for work performed pursuant to the terms of the contract. The contract document shall state the types of securities to be accepted and the procedural requirements for the deposits. Section 54. If a purchasing agency elects to use and occupy the public improvement before acceptance, the purchasing agency shall pay all amounts due under the contract except double the amount that the architect or engineer estimates to be necessary to complete the improvement in accordance with the plans and specifications or one percent of the contract price, or in any event not less than three hundred dollars. No interest may commence until thirty days after the work has been fully completed. Section 55. The purchasing agency may appoint a competent superintendent who may be the architect or engineer furnishing the plans and specifications for the public improvement. The superintendent shall report to the purchasing agency or board every thirty days as to the progress and character of the work done by the contractor. Upon the reports of the superintendent, the purchasing agency shall make payments promptly to the contractor during the process of construction to the extent provided by the contract based on the value of the work done and materials furnished. The payments shall be divided into such installments as the board and the contractor may agree upon at the time of entering into the contract, and which shall be included in and be a part of the terms of the contract. No payment, however, constitutes an acceptance, in whole or in part, by the purchasing agency prior to making of the final payment and acceptance in full completion of the contract. Final payment of any sums due to the contractor shall be made within thirty days after the completion and acceptance of the public improvement by the purchasing agency. Section 56. No person, firm, or corporation may act as architect or engineer and also contractor on any public work in this state if the amount to be expended upon such public work exceeds one hundred thousand dollars. Any public works of an emergency nature which affect the public health and safety of the state and are funded through the use of an emergency appropriation or special appropriation, and any full-service firm which specialize in the design, fabrication, and installation of cultural and educational exhibits are exempt from this section.

Before final payment may be made on any contract for public improvement, the purchasing agency awarding the contract shall require the contractor to furnish a certificate from the Department of Labor that all contributions and interest due to the Department of Labor in the performance of the contract have been paid. Section 60. Any amendment or change order to an existing contract for construction, reconstruction, or remodeling of a public improvement does not need to be bid if: (1) The contract contains unit prices for the same type or class of work; (2) The change or extra work is necessitated by circumstances related to soils, utilities, or unknown conditions directly affecting the performance of the work that were not reasonably foreseeable at the time the underlying contract was let and the change or extra work is necessary to the completion of the public improvement; or (3) The sum of the proposed amendment or change order plus the sum of all other prior unbid amendments or change orders, exclusive of change orders issued under subdivisions (1) and (2) of this section, does not exceed the following: (a) For contracts not more than five hundred thousand dollars, the greater of twenty-five thousand dollars or fifteen percent of the base contract; (b) For contracts exceeding five hundred thousand dollars but not more than two million five hundred thousand dollars, the greater of seventy-five thousand dollars or ten percent of the base contract; and (c) For contracts exceeding two million five hundred thousand dollars, the greater of two hundred fifty thousand dollars or five percent of the base contract.

Section 68. The performance criteria developer shall be either an employee of the purchasing agency or shall be engaged in accordance with statutorial procedures for contracting with professional services. With the approval of the purchasing agency, the developer may delegate or contract for the development of specific aspects of the design criteria to other consultants. The performance criteria developer may be retained at the purchasing agency's option through to the completion of the design-build contract. Section 69. The purchasing agency, in consultation with the performance criteria developer, shall determine the scope and level of detail required for the performance criteria. The performance criteria shall be detailed enough to permit a person to submit a proposal in accordance with the design-build request for proposals, given the nature of the public project and the level of design to be provided in the proposal. Section 70. After a minimum of three design-builders have been pre-qualified in accordance with section 72 of this Act, a design-build request for proposals shall be mailed to each pre-qualified design-builder.

The deposit or security may be forfeited if the proposal is accepted but the design-builder fails to execute the design-build contract. Section 74. Any proposal shall be sealed and may not be opened until expiration of the time established for making proposals as set forth in the design-build request for proposals. To the extent required by the request for proposals, any proposal shall identify each person to whom the design-builder proposes to sublet obligations under the design-build contract. At a minimum, any proposal shall identify each person to whom the design-builder proposes to sublet any design obligations or general construction obligations. Any person so identified may not be replaced without the approval of the purchasing agency. Any proposal shall establish a cost of the design-build contract that may not be exceeded if the proposal is accepted without change. The maximum cost in the proposal may be converted to fixed prices by negotiated agreement between the purchasing agency and the selected design-builder. Section 75. Until a proposal is accepted, the drawings, specifications, and other information in the proposal remain the property of the person making the proposal. The purchasing agency shall make reasonable efforts to maintain the secrecy and confidentiality of any proposal and all information contained in any proposal and may not disclose any proposal or the information contained in a proposal to the design-builder's competitors.

Section 76. Once received, any proposal shall be submitted to the performance criteria developer for review. Clarifications may be required to ensure conformance of any proposal with the performance criteria. In seeking clarifications, the performance criteria developer may not reveal any aspect of any design-builder's proposal to any other design-builder. No proposal may be considered until the performance criteria developer issues a written opinion that the proposal is consistent with the performance criteria. Once the performance criteria developer has issued such an opinion, the proposal shall be submitted to the governing body of the purchasing agency for review and evaluation. No proposal or design-build contract may be accepted unless the purchasing agency determines there was adequate competition for such contract. Section 77. After obtaining and evaluating proposals according to the criteria and procedures set forth in the design-build request for proposals, a purchasing agency may accept the proposal it considers most advantageous to the purchasing agency. Acceptance of a proposal shall be by written notice to the design-builder which submitted the accepted proposal. At the same time notice of acceptance is delivered, the purchasing agency shall also inform, in writing, the other design-builders that their proposals were not accepted. Unless all proposals are rejected, a detailed breakdown of the evaluation criteria scores for each proposal received shall be made available to the public after signature execution of the design-build contract. The contract for development of performance criteria shall terminate if a contract is awarded to the design-builder. Section 78. The purchasing agency may reject any and all design-build proposals. The purchasing agency may solicit new proposals using the same or different performance criteria, budget constraints, or qualifications. Section 79. Any design-build proposal may be withdrawn by the proposer for any reason at any time prior to acceptance. Section 80.

Each bid shall be evaluated based on the requirements set forth in the invitation for bids, which may include criteria to determine acceptability such as inspection, testing, quality, workmanship, delivery, and suitability for a particular purpose. Those criteria that will affect the bid price and be considered in evaluation for award shall be objectively measurable, such as discounts, transportation costs, and total or life cycle costs. The invitation for bids shall set forth the evaluation criteria to be used. No criteria may be used in bid evaluation that are not set forth in the invitation for bids; (6) Any bid may be withdrawn by letter or by electronic communications or in person before the time specified in the advertisement therefor. The purchasing agency may allow modification of bids by mail, facsimile, or electronic notice received at the place designated in the invitation to bid not later than the time set for the opening of bids. A modification may not reveal the bid price but shall provide the addition or subtraction or the modification so that the final prices or terms will not be known to the purchasing agency until the sealed bid is opened. A modification may not be withdrawn after the time set for the opening of bids. Each modification shall be confirmed in writing by the successful bidder before award of the contract. No bid made may be changed or altered by telephone. After bid opening, no change in bid prices or other provisions of bids prejudicial to the interest of the purchasing agency or fair competition is permitted. The purchasing agency may waive technical irregularities in the bid or proposal of the low bidder or offeror which irregularities do not alter the price, quality, or quantity of the services, or items of tangible personal property bid or offered. Any decision to permit the correction or withdrawal of a bid, or to cancel an award or a contract based on a bid mistake, shall be supported by a written determination made by the purchasing agency, and included in the bid file; (7) The contract shall be awarded within thirty days of the bid opening by written notice to the lowest responsible and responsive bidder whose bid meets the requirements and criteria set forth in the invitation for bids. The purchasing agency may reject any and all bids and readvertise for bids if none of the bids are satisfactory, or if the purchasing agency believes an agreement has been entered into by the bidders to prevent competition. If the low bidder is not responsible or the bid is not made in accordance with the requirements of this Act or the low bid is withdrawn, the bid of the next lowest responsible and responsive bidder may be accepted; (8) If it is considered impractical to initially prepare a purchase description to support an award based on price, an invitation for bids may be issued requesting the submission of unpriced offers to be followed by an invitation for bids limited to those bidders whose offers have been qualified under the criteria set forth in the first solicitation; (9) If, after advertising for bids, no firm bids are received, the purchasing agency may negotiate a contract for the purchase of the supplies, services, or public improvement projects at the most advantageous price, if the specifications of the original bid are met; (10) If two or more competitive sealed bids submitted are identical in price and product quality, the bids are the low bid, and no resident bidder preference is applicable, the purchasing agency may: (a) Award the bid by lottery to one of the identical low bidders; or (b) Reject all the bids and resolicit bids for the required supplies, services, or public improvement. Section 7. A contract may be entered into by competitive sealed proposals if the purchasing agency determines in writing that the use of competitive sealed bids is either not practicable or not advantageous. Section 8. The procedures for issuing a contract through competitive sealed proposals are as follows: (1) The proposals shall be solicited through a request for proposals. The request for proposals shall state the relative importance of price and other factors, if any; (2) Public notice of the request for proposals shall be given pursuant to section 17 of this Act; (3) A proposal may be submitted either manually or electronically in a manner authorized by the purchasing agency; (4) Each proposal shall be opened so as to avoid disclosure of contents to competing offerors during the process of negotiation. A register of proposals shall be prepared documenting the name and address of each offeror and identifying each offeror awarded a contract. The register shall be open for public inspection after contract award; (5) As provided in the request for proposals, a discussion may be conducted with any responsible offeror who submitted a proposal determined to be reasonably susceptible of being selected for award for the purpose of clarification to assure full understanding of, and responsiveness to, the solicitation requirements. Each offeror shall be accorded fair and equal treatment with respect to any opportunity for discussion and revision of a proposal. A revision may be permitted after a submission and prior to an award for the purpose of obtaining the best and final offer. In conducting any discussion, there may be no disclosure of any information derived from any proposal submitted by a competing offeror; (6) An award shall be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal conforms to the solicitation and is determined in writing to be the most advantageous to the purchasing agency taking into consideration price and the evaluation factors set forth in the request for proposals. No other factors or criteria may be used in the evaluation. The contract file shall contain the basis on which the award is made. Written notice of the award of a contract to the successful offeror shall be promptly given to each offeror. The purchasing agency may reject any and all proposals and readvertise for proposals if none of the proposals are satisfactory, or if the purchasing agency believes any agreement has been entered into by the offerors to prevent competition; and (7) This section does not apply to state professional service contracts issued pursuant to sections 112 to 121, inclusive, of this Act. Section 9. A reverse auction may be used by a purchasing agency for the purchase of supplies or services. Prior to conducting a reverse auction, the purchasing agency shall: (1) Pre-qualify bidders to participate in the reverse auction event. Pre-qualification shall be completed by issuing an invitation to qualify to any bidder registered on the state bidder list, and any other vendor that requests a copy of the invitation to qualify. The factors used to determine if a vendor qualifies for the reverse auction shall be clearly stated in the invitation to qualify. No other factors may be used to qualify a vendor for the reverse auction than those stated in the invitation to qualify; (2) The purchasing agency shall advertise the invitation to qualify in the same manner as required for competitive sealed bids or competitive sealed proposals. The invitation to qualify shall be in the form of a competitive sealed bid or competitive sealed proposal. Public notice of the invitation shall be given pursuant to section 17 of this Act; (3) The purchasing agency shall notify each responding vendor as to whether the vendor is invited to the reverse auction. The purchasing agency may not disclose to the public or to any other vendor, the name of any vendor that has been invited to the reverse auction until after the reverse auction has occurred; (4) The purchasing agency may limit the number of bidders to be selected to participate in the reverse auction; (5) Each bidder shall directly participate in the reverse auction. The purchasing agency may not accept any bid via phone, fax, or some other alternate method on behalf of a bidder that is unable to enter a bid on the internet for whatever reason; (6) Any clarification, negotiation, and acceptance of any specification, requirement, and term and condition shall occur before the purchasing agency decides whether to invite a vendor to the reverse auction. After the reverse auction, the purchasing agency may permit a change only with the limitation that the change does not alter the scope or content of the original solicitation to a degree that will affect the justification that was used to eliminate any other vendor from being invited to the reverse auction; (7) During any reverse auction, the on-line view of any bid presented to any bidder may not indicate names, aliases, or identifiers of any kind as to who has placed a particular bid. Each bidder shall only be able to see the amount of the bid; (8) If a bidder loses the ability to place a bid during an auction for any reason, the auction shall be suspended as soon as practical and remain suspended until each bidder regains the ability to place bids via the internet auction site. If no resolution to the problem is imminent, the reverse auction may be terminated and rescheduled by the purchasing agency for a later date. In addition, the auction may be suspended or terminated for any reason by the purchasing agency or the reverse auction service provider. Upon resuming an auction after a suspension, the time remaining shall be the time remaining when the auction was suspended or ten minutes, whichever is greater; (9) In conducting a reverse auction, the agency may establish an extension activation period, which is the number of minutes before the end of the auction during which, if a bid is received, the auction will be extended by a pre-defined number of additional minutes. The minimum extension activation period that may be used is ten minutes; and (10) After the reverse auction is completed, any award shall be made in accordance with the requirements for competitive sealed bids or competitive sealed proposals. Section 10. Only the Bureau of Administration may conduct any reverse auction on behalf of a state agency. Section 11. A contract may be awarded for supplies or services without competition if the purchasing agency determines in writing that the supplies or services are of such a unique nature that the contractor selected is clearly and justifiably the only practicable source to provide the supplies or services. The determination that the contractor selected is justifiably the sole source shall be based on either the uniqueness of the supplies or services or the sole availability at the location required. In such cases, the purchasing agency shall conduct negotiations, including price, delivery, and quantity to obtain the most advantageous price and shall include the written verification of the sole source in the contract file. This section does not apply to construction services or construction equipment. Section 12. A purchasing agency may make or authorize others to make an emergency procurement without advertising the procurement if there exists a threat to public health, welfare, or safety and if the emergency procurement is made with such competition as is practicable under the circumstances. A written determination of the basis for the emergency and for the selection of the particular contractor shall be included in the contract file. Section 13. The purchasing agency shall maintain a record listing each contract made under sole source procurement and emergency procurement for a minimum of five years. The record shall contain: (1) Each contractor's name; (2) The amount and type of each contract; and (3) A listing of the supplies, services, and public improvements procured under each contract. Section 14. Unless otherwise specified by statute, purchases of supplies and services under ten thousand dollars shall be made as follows: (1) State purchases of supplies over one thousand dollars and under ten thousand dollars shall be processed by the Bureau of Administration and shall be made by first obtaining three quotes from different vendors. If three quotes cannot be obtained, a sole source justification shall accompany the purchase request and the Bureau of Administration may approve the purchase if in the best interest of the state, require additional quotes to be obtained, or require the purchase be advertised for bids; (2) State purchases of supplies under one thousand dollars may be made in accordance with procedures established by the purchasing agency in the best interests of the state; (3) State purchases of services under ten thousand dollars may be made in accordance with procedures established by the purchasing agency in the best interests of the state; and (4) For all other purchasing agencies, purchases under ten thousand dollars may be made in accordance with procedures established by the purchasing agency. No purchases may be artificially divided to constitute a small purchase under this section. Section 15. An invitation for bids, a request for proposals, or other solicitation may be canceled, or any or all bids or proposals may be rejected in whole or in part as may be specified in the solicitation, if the purchasing agency determines it is in the best interests of the agency. The reasons for the cancellation or rejection shall be made part of the contract file. Section 16. There is hereby created a centralized public bid exchange. The Bureau of Administration shall establish the exchange either within the bureau or within another public or private organization. The purpose of the exchange is to facilitate the publishing of official state and political subdivision bids to provide greater notice to bidders and to the state and its political subdivisions. The exchange shall maintain a list of all state bids and proposals and all bids and proposals provided by political subdivisions which participate in the exchange. The exchange shall set and charge each bidder, offeror, or political subdivision or both a fee for participation in the exchange to defray the cost of administering the exchange. Section 17. If the purchasing agency intends to enter into a contract for the construction of a new building or for the remodeling or addition to an existing building that involves the expenditure of fifty thousand dollars or more, a contract for any other public improvement that involves the expenditure of twenty-five thousand dollars or more, or a contract for the purchase of supplies or services, other than professional services, that involves the expenditure of ten thousand dollars or more, the purchasing agency shall advertise for bids or proposals. The advertisement shall appear as a legal notice in the appointed legal newspaper. The advertisement shall be printed at least twice, with the first publication at least ten days before opening of bids or the deadline for the submission of proposals. The first publication shall be in each official newspaper of the purchasing agency, and the second publication may be in any legal newspaper of the state chosen by the purchasing agency. If the purchasing agency has no official newspaper, the first publication shall be made in a legal newspaper with general circulation in the jurisdiction of the purchasing agency to be selected by the purchasing agency. The advertisement shall state the time and place where the bids will be opened or the deadline for the submission of proposals. In each notice, the purchasing agency shall reserve the right to reject any or all bids or proposals. If a purchasing agency lists an invitation for bids or request for proposals on the centralized bid exchange pursuant to section 16 of this Act, the purchasing agency need not make the publication required by this section. Section 18. After receiving notice of a contract award, the successful bidder or offeror shall enter into a contract with the purchasing agency within the time specified in the invitation for bids or request for proposals. If any bidder or offeror fails to enter into a contract within the time specified, the contract may be awarded to the next lowest responsive and responsible bidder or offeror for the same kind of work and material, unless all bids or proposals are rejected. The defaulting bidder or offeror shall be responsible for the difference in price. Section 19.

Those criteria that will affect the bid price and be considered in evaluation for award shall be objectively measurable, such as discounts, transportation costs, and total or life cycle costs. The invitation for bids shall set forth the evaluation criteria to be used. No criteria may be used in bid evaluation that are not set forth in the invitation for bids; (6) Any bid may be withdrawn by letter or by electronic communications or in person before the time specified in the advertisement therefor.

A modification may not reveal the bid price but shall provide the addition or subtraction or the modification so that the final prices or terms will not be known to the purchasing agency until the sealed bid is opened. A modification may not be withdrawn after the time set for the opening of bids. Each modification shall be confirmed in writing by the successful bidder before award of the contract. No bid made may be changed or altered by telephone. After bid opening, no withdrawal of a bid or change in bid prices or other provisions of bids prejudicial to the interest of the purchasing agency or fair competition is permitted. The purchasing agency may waive technical irregularities in the bid or proposal of the low bidder or offeror which irregularities do not alter the price, quality, or quantity of the services, or items of tangible personal property bid or offered.

The purchasing agency may reject any and all bids and readvertise for bids if none of the bids are satisfactory, or if the purchasing agency believes an agreement has been entered into by the bidders to prevent competition. If the low bidder is not responsible or the bid is not made in accordance with the requirements of this Act or the low bid is withdrawn as authorized by this section, the bid of the next lowest responsible and responsive bidder may be accepted; (8) If it is considered impractical to initially prepare a purchase description to support an award based on price, an invitation for bids may be issued requesting the submission of unpriced offers to be followed by an invitation for bids limited to those bidders whose offers have been qualified under the criteria set forth in the first solicitation; (9) If, after advertising for bids, no firm bids are received, the purchasing agency may negotiate a contract for the purchase of the supplies, services, or public improvement projects at the most advantageous price, if the specifications of the original bid are met; (10) If two or more competitive sealed bids submitted are identical in price and product quality, the bids are the low bid, and no resident bidder preference is applicable, the purchasing agency may: (a) Award the bid by lottery to one of the identical low bidders; or (b) Reject all the bids and resolicit bids for the required supplies, services, or public improvement.

The request for proposals shall state the relative importance of price and other factors, if any; (2) Public notice of the request for proposals shall be given pursuant to section 15 of this Act; (3) A proposal may be submitted either manually or electronically in a manner authorized by the purchasing agency; (4) Each proposal shall be opened so as to avoid disclosure of contents to competing offerors during the process of negotiation. A register of proposals shall be prepared documenting the name and address of each offeror and identifying each offeror awarded a contract. The register shall be open for public inspection after contract award; (5) As provided in the request for proposals, a discussion may be conducted with any responsible offeror who submitted a proposal determined to be reasonably susceptible of being selected for award for the purpose of clarification to assure full understanding of, and responsiveness to, the solicitation requirements. Each offeror shall be accorded fair and equal treatment with respect to any opportunity for discussion and revision of a proposal. A revision may be permitted after a submission and prior to an award for the purpose of obtaining the best and final offer. In conducting any discussion, there may be no disclosure of any information derived from any proposal submitted by a competing offeror; (6) An award shall be made to the responsible offeror whose proposal conforms to the solicitation and is determined in writing to be the most advantageous to the purchasing agency taking into consideration price and the evaluation factors set forth in the request for proposals. No other factors or criteria may be used in the evaluation. The contract file shall contain the basis on which the award is made. Written notice of the award of a contract to the successful offeror shall be promptly given to each offeror. The purchasing agency may reject any and all proposals and readvertise for proposals if none of the proposals are satisfactory, or if the purchasing agency believes any agreement has been entered into by the offerors to prevent competition; and (7) This section does not apply to state professional service contracts issued pursuant to sections 110 to 119, inclusive, of this Act. Section 9. A contract may be awarded for supplies or services without competition if the purchasing agency determines in writing that the supplies or services are of such a unique nature that the contractor selected is clearly and justifiably the only practicable source to provide the supplies or services. The determination that the contractor selected is justifiably the sole source shall be based on either the uniqueness of the supplies or services or the sole availability at the location required. In such cases, the purchasing agency shall conduct negotiations, including price, delivery, and quantity to obtain the most advantageous price and shall include the written verification of the sole source in the contract file. This section does not apply to construction services or construction equipment. Section 10. A purchasing agency may make or authorize others to make an emergency procurement without advertising the procurement if rentals are not practicable and there exists a threat to public health, welfare, or safety or for other urgent and compelling reasons. Failure to abide by the bid provisions of this Act in a timely manner is not an emergency. An emergency procurement shall be made with such competition as is practicable under the circumstances. A written determination of the basis for the emergency and for the selection of the particular contractor shall be included in the contract file. Section 11. The purchasing agency shall maintain a record listing each contract made under sole source procurement and emergency procurement for a minimum of five years. The record shall contain: (1) Each contractor's name; (2) The amount and type of each contract; and (3) A listing of the supplies, services, and public improvements procured under each contract.

No purchases may be artificially divided to constitute a small purchase under this section. Section 13. An invitation for bids, a request for proposals, or other solicitation may be canceled, or any or all bids or proposals may be rejected in whole or in part as may be specified in the solicitation, if the purchasing agency determines it is in the best interests of the agency. The reasons for the cancellation or rejection shall be made part of the contract file. Section 14. There is hereby created a centralized public bid exchange. The Bureau of Administration shall establish the exchange either within the bureau or within another public or private organization. The purpose of the exchange is to facilitate the publishing of official state and political subdivision bids to provide greater notice to bidders and to the state and its political subdivisions. The exchange shall maintain a list of all state bids and proposals and all bids and proposals provided by political subdivisions which participate in the exchange. The exchange shall set and charge each bidder, offeror, or political subdivision or both a fee for participation in the exchange to defray the cost of administering the exchange. Section 15. If the purchasing agency intends to enter into a contract for any public improvement that involves the expenditure of fifty thousand dollars or more, or a contract for the purchase of supplies or services, other than professional services, that involves the expenditure of twenty-five thousand dollars or more, the purchasing agency shall advertise for bids or proposals. The advertisement shall appear as a legal notice in the appointed legal newspaper. The advertisement shall be printed at least twice, with the first publication at least ten days before opening of bids or the deadline for the submission of proposals. The first publication shall be in each official newspaper of the purchasing agency, and the second publication may be in any legal newspaper of the state chosen by the purchasing agency. If the purchasing agency has no official newspaper, the first publication shall be made in a legal newspaper with general circulation in the jurisdiction of the purchasing agency to be selected by the purchasing agency. The advertisement shall state the time and place where the bids will be opened or the deadline for the submission of proposals. In each notice, the purchasing agency shall reserve the right to reject any or all bids or proposals. Section 16. After receiving notice of a contract award, the successful bidder or offeror shall enter into a contract with the purchasing agency within the time specified in the invitation for bids or request for proposals. If any bidder or offeror fails to enter into a contract within the time specified, the contract may be awarded to the next lowest responsive and responsible bidder or offeror for the same kind of work and material, unless all bids or proposals are rejected. The defaulting bidder or offeror shall be responsible for the difference in price. Section 17. If any successful bidder or offeror fails to fulfill the conditions of an awarded contract, the purchasing agency may proceed to recover from the defaulting party whatever damages may have been sustained as a result of the default. The purchasing agency shall have all remedies provided in the contract and provided by law. Section 18. No officer or employee who approves, awards, or administers a contract involving the expenditure of public funds or the sale or lease of property, may have an interest in a contract that is within the scope of the officer's or employee's official duties. This prohibition includes any officer or employee who, in his or her official capacity, recommends the approval or award of the contract or who supervises a person who approves, awards, or administers the contract. This prohibition does not include any officer who serves without compensation or who may be paid per diem pursuant to \u00a7 4-7-10.4. Any contract made in violation of this section is void. Any officer or employee who knowingly violates this section is guilty of a Class 2 misdemeanor. Section 19. Any specification shall seek to promote overall economy for the purposes intended and encourage competition in satisfying the purchasing agency's needs, and may not be unduly restrictive. Brand name or equal specifications may be used if the purchasing agency determines in writing that: (1) No other design or performance specification or qualified products list is available; (2) Time does not permit the preparation of another form of purchase description, not including a brand name specification; (3) The nature of the product or the nature of the purchasing agency's requirements makes use of a brand name or equal specification suitable for the procurement; or (4) Use of a brand name or equal specification is in the purchasing agency's best interests. Section 20. Brand name or equal specifications shall seek to designate three, or as many different brands as are practicable, as \"or equal\" references and shall further state that substantially equivalent products to those designated will be considered for award. Unless the purchasing agency determines in writing that the essential characteristics of the brand names included in the specifications are commonly known in the industry or trade, brand name or equal specifications shall include a description of the particular design, functional, or performance characteristics which are required. If a brand name or equal specification is used in a solicitation, the solicitation shall contain explanatory language that the use of a brand name is for the purpose of describing the standard of quality, performance, and characteristics desired and is not intended to limit or restrict competition. Section 21. Brand name specification may be used only if the purchasing agency makes a written determination that only the identified brand name item or items will satisfy the agency's needs. The agency shall seek to identify sources from which the designated brand name item or items can be obtained and shall solicit such sources to achieve whatever degree of price competition is practicable. If only one source can supply the requirement, the procurement shall be made under the sole source procurement provisions of section 9 of this Act. Section 22. Each contract shall be in writing and shall be signed on behalf of the purchasing agency by the authorized officials. Section 23.

Section 28. In awarding a contract, if all things are equal, including the price and quality of the supplies or services, a purchasing agency shall give preference: (1) To a qualified agency if the other equal low bid or proposal was submitted by a business that was not a qualified agency; (2) To a resident business if the other equal low bid or proposal was submitted by a nonresident business; (3) To a resident manufacturer if the other equal low bid or proposal was submitted by a resident business that is not a manufacturer; (4) To a resident business whose principal place of business is located in the State of South Dakota, if the other equal low bid or proposal was submitted by a resident business whose principal place of business is not located in the State of South Dakota; or (5) To a nonresident business providing or utilizing supplies or services found in South Dakota, if the other equal low bid or proposal was submitted by a nonresident business not providing or utilizing supplies or services found in South Dakota. In computing price, the cost of transportation, if any, including delivery, shall be considered. Section 29. A resident bidder shall be allowed a preference on a contract against the bid of any bidder from any other state or foreign province that enforces or has a preference for resident bidders. The amount of the preference given to the resident bidder shall be equal to the preference in the other state or foreign province. Section 30.

Any contract entered into in violation of this Act is null and void. Section 37. The Bureau of Administration shall serve as the central procurement agency of the State of South Dakota. Except for the legislative and judicial branches and as otherwise specifically provided in this Act, the Bureau of Administration shall procure, or authorize the procurement of all supplies and public improvements for state government. No claim for any such procurement may be paid unless authorization has been issued by the bureau. All state agencies and institutions are responsible for the procurement of services for their respective governmental unit. The governing body of all other purchasing agencies, including the legislative and judicial branches of state government, is responsible for procuring or authorizing the procurement of supplies, services, and public improvements for their respective governmental unit. Section 38. In the procurement of supplies or services, a purchasing agency may require a bond or an approved security to be submitted with any bid or proposal as a guarantee that the bidder will enter into a contract with the purchasing agency. No offeror or bidder may be required to leave the bond or security posted for a longer period than thirty days if the bid or proposal is not accepted. The bond or approved security of the successful offeror or bidder shall be returned upon the signing of the contract. Section 39. For any public improvement contract, a performance and payment bond is required pursuant to chapter 5-21.

In any case, the bond or approved security of the successful offeror or bidder shall be returned upon satisfactory completion of the contract. Section 40. If a contract is for the construction of a public improvement, the required advertisement shall state where the plans and specifications may be examined. The plans and specifications for the construction of any public improvement shall be and remain on file in the office of the purchasing agency at all times from the beginning of the publication of the advertisement for bids until the completion of the public improvement. The purchasing agency shall, upon request, furnish at least one copy of the plans and specifications, without charge, to each contractor resident in South Dakota who intends, in good faith, to bid upon the public improvement. The copy shall be available at the date of the first publication of the advertisement for bids. The purchasing agency may require the return of the copy at the time of the opening of the bids.

Such bond to be issued by a surety authorized to do business in this state payable to the purchasing agency, as a guaranty that the bidder will enter into a contract with the purchasing agency, its board or officers thereof, in accordance with the terms of the letting and bid in case the bidder be awarded the contract. Section 42. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 41 of this Act, the requirement of a bid bond, certified or cashier's check, cash, or other security may be waived by the purchasing agency if the bid submitted does not exceed fifty thousand dollars. Section 43. No purchasing agency may, directly or indirectly, require or direct a bidder on any public improvement contract that is about to be or has been competitively bid to obtain from a particular insurer or insurance producer any surety bond or contract of insurance required in the bid or contract or required by any law, ordinance, or rule. However, the surety insurer shall be an authorized insurer under Title 58. Nothing in this section prevents any purchasing agency from exercising the right to approve or reject a surety bond or contract of insurance as to its form or sufficiency. Section 44. If the lowest responsive and responsible bid for a public improvement project exceeds the final estimated project cost, the Bureau of Administration, acting on behalf of the state, or any other purchasing agency may negotiate with that low bidder for the construction of a public improvement at the most advantageous price. Section 45. Prior to execution of a public improvement contract, a successful bidder shall certify: (1) That no more than twenty percent of the cost of labor included in the contract is being provided by nonresident subcontractors; or (2) That more then twenty percent of the cost of labor included in the contract is being provided by nonresident subcontractors because resident contractors are not available and at competitive prices. The bidder shall also provide any information requested by the purchasing agency to verify the certification. Section 46.

The interest shall continue until the date when payment is tendered to the contractor unless delay in payment has been the result of federal participation in the contract in which event interest may not begin until thirty days after payment by the federal authority involved. If a portion of a progress payment is retained, other than the final payment, the purchasing agency shall pay to the contractor interest as set by the purchasing agency at a rate of not less than the category E rate of interest as established by \u00a7 54-3-16 on the amount retained beginning thirty days after the contractor has furnished the purchasing agency with all required records and reports and a progress inspection.

Upon the reports of the superintendent, the purchasing agency shall make payments promptly to the contractor during the process of construction to the extent provided by the contract based on the value of the work done and materials furnished. The payments shall be divided into such installments as the board and the contractor may agree upon at the time of entering into the contract, and which shall be included in and be a part of the terms of the contract. No payment, however, constitutes an acceptance, in whole or in part, by the purchasing agency prior to making of the final payment and acceptance in full completion of the contract. Final payment of any sums due to the contractor shall be made within thirty days after the completion and acceptance of the public improvement by the purchasing agency. Section 54.

Before final payment may be made on any contract for public improvement, the purchasing agency awarding the contract shall require the contractor to furnish a certificate from the Department of Labor that all contributions and interest due to the Department of Labor in the performance of the contract have been paid. Section 58. Any amendment or change order to an existing contract for construction, reconstruction, or remodeling of a public improvement does not need to be bid if: (1) The contract contains unit prices for the same type or class of work; (2) The change or extra work is necessitated by circumstances related to soils, utilities, or unknown conditions directly affecting the performance of the work that were not reasonably foreseeable at the time the underlying contract was let and the change or extra work is necessary to the completion of the public improvement; or (3) The sum of the proposed amendment or change order plus the sum of all other prior unbid amendments or change orders, exclusive of change orders issued under subdivisions (1) and (2) of this section, does not exceed the following: (a) For contracts not more than five hundred thousand dollars, the greater of twenty-five thousand dollars or fifteen percent of the base contract; (b) For contracts exceeding five hundred thousand dollars but not more than two million five hundred thousand dollars, the greater of seventy-five thousand dollars or ten percent of the base contract; and (c) For contracts exceeding two million five hundred thousand dollars, the greater of two hundred fifty thousand dollars or five percent of the base contract.

Section 66. The performance criteria developer shall be either an employee of the purchasing agency or shall be engaged in accordance with statutorial procedures for contracting with professional services. With the approval of the purchasing agency, the developer may delegate or contract for the development of specific aspects of the design criteria to other consultants.

Each conceptual drawing shall contain the minimum information necessary to convey the requirements. No design-build request for proposals may include detailed construction specifications. Any design and construction standards in the request for proposals shall be performance standards only. Section 70.

Any proposal shall be sealed and may not be opened until expiration of the time established for making proposals as set forth in the design-build request for proposals. To the extent required by the request for proposals, any proposal shall identify each person to whom the design-builder proposes to sublet obligations under the design-build contract. At a minimum, any proposal shall identify each person to whom the design-builder proposes to sublet any design obligations or general construction obligations. Any person so identified may not be replaced without the approval of the purchasing agency. Any proposal shall establish a cost of the design-build contract that may not be exceeded if the proposal is accepted without change. The maximum cost in the proposal may be converted to fixed prices by negotiated agreement between the purchasing agency and the selected design-builder. Section 73.

Once the performance criteria developer has issued such an opinion, the proposal shall be submitted to the governing body of the purchasing agency for review and evaluation. No proposal or design-build contract may be accepted unless the purchasing agency determines there was adequate competition for such contract. Section 75. After obtaining and evaluating proposals according to the criteria and procedures set forth in the design-build request for proposals, a purchasing agency may accept the proposal it considers most advantageous to the purchasing agency.
