Section 2. That chapter 62-6 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: For the purposes of this Act, the term, frivolous, means without a good faith investigation of the facts or on a basis that is clearly contrary to fact or law. Section 3.

Section 4. That chapter 62-6 be amended by adding thereto a NEW SECTION to read as follows: If an insurer or employer persists in an action or omission proscribed in section 1 of this Act, or does not permit the examination of books and records, or fails to furnish information as required, the secretary or the director shall file a written complaint with the Department of Revenue and Regulation. The complaint shall specify the facts and recommend the revocation of the license of the insurer to do business in this state. The claimant, or its representative, or the circuit court may also file a written complaint. Section 5.
